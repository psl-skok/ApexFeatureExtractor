0770110278303,"[Client] I mean my cell phones do not cost that much. OK. [Agent] Perfect thank you. So right now with the [Client] But uh Right. Yeah, I will consider that. Got you. Got you. X $40 yeah. [Agent] the phones are paid off [Client] Oh that is great. [Agent] It would be a time frame between XX and X. [Client] You know Sure. [Agent] Let me set that part up. [Client] And uh and they still kept charging her for it and you know we we reached an agreement on it and I said well I am going to have to have a landline phone to reopen the business and so. [Agent] Bye bye. [Client] Uh, the address is XXX. All right. we have our visa machines I will try to keep an eye on the Yeah, um, can I see about setting that up and I will, uh, I will call AT&T and cancel with them, uh, because they just. Mm. Hi Desmond, I have been a customer, uh, with you guys for some time. We have X I think so. [Agent] Perfect with the letter of authorization. [Client] Yeah, I will look it over. [Agent] Perfect. [Client] Mm That is the country that is all. I do not care what kind of deals they have now. [Agent] Looks like everything's coming up between XX and X for all the days. [Client] basically. OK. [Agent] It would be more per month probably. [Client] Yeah, yours is much better. [Agent] Yes, hi, thank you for being patient. [Client] I am, I am switching over to uh Optimum for the landline. I am sorry, go ahead. This is just, uh, I have had that phone line, uh. [Agent] I will put the note down for XX minutes, hopefully they will give you a call around that time. [Client] No, uh, we when we set it up, they my mother had it, uh. everything works good nothing buffers or lags [Agent] What is your address or account number? [Client] Just one, I am, you know, by state law I have to have a landline in there and I got AT&T, uh, because I did not know anyone else that had them this before you guys had service there and uh they have got an exorbitant price so that is why I am calling to see if you guys. Um, I think we are OK for now because we, we stream on uh what is it X TV sets in there Sure. Hello? [Agent] I will have to look into it, but I think it would be like an additional probably $80.90 dollars to upgrade from the $300 to XGB. [Client] OK. [Agent] Yeah, that is a lot. No, no, what were you going to say? [Client] There is quite a bit of buffering. Thanks. [Agent] This is all set for you, uh, for once again next Wednesday between XX and X tech will give you a call about. [Client] I might switch over my uh cell accounts here too I mean uh we got these contracts through Verizon but uh. [Agent] What number would you like for them to call? [Client] I know we are still paying on a couple of phones, so I do not know if that makes that probably makes a difference on it too. [Agent] Yeah, at that point it definitely is. [Client] Uh, well, [Agent] So they typically would give you a call I could put down in the notes to please try and call XX minutes out, but they typically will give you a call about XX-XX minutes away because it depends on where the previous install is. So if it is not too far away, then that is when I will give you a call when they are leaving that location. I, yeah, I hear you. [Client] Yeah. OK. OK. [Agent] So for example, the number could take anywhere from a few days to possibly a week to be released from them. You could definitely bring those phones over and for the ones that are not, then you would have to either pay them out with the current provider to be able to bring them or relinquish them and then we can issue new phones so you have a few options. [Client] You know they just got it installed here where we live [Agent] Yeah [Client] the clock too to be down there during that time OK, that sounds good. this number here is XXX-XXX-XXXX Oh thank you. [Agent] So right now if you add the one phone line that would make your total monthly bill to XX. This is Desmond. OK, so you will be receiving that shortly today within about an hour. Perfect thank you. Technically, but I do like to tell customers after the install that is when you would give them a call to officially cancel the service, so they will not have any type of lingering leftover fees with you. We even offer, um, mobile service now as well, the Optimum mobile. [Client] OK Alright [Agent] So do not cancel or place any disconnect order on the service until it is installed. Thank you for calling Optimum Business sales, home of the Optimum Mobile. [Client] Crystal, C R Y S T A L Palace P A L A C E Drive. [Agent] So it looks like the number would be released next Wednesday, the 3rd. [Client] OK. No, we are not that is just it. Uh, yeah, possibly I will take a look over our accounts and see where we are at. Mhm. XXXX. OK. Through them And they were charging her even worse, like $250 a month or something like that. They, they started by pricing at that and it is, it is been staying that way and I do not know why, but I have had enough. [Agent] so I could definitely start the process right now Because that will stop the number from being ported over. I am sorry, my text with unlimited, uh, calling across the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada. [Client] We do not yeah we never use it because uh. [Agent] OK. [Client] Uh, I was going to say, can they call me at this number before, uh, before they head there because I am XX minutes away from the business. [Agent] Got you so let us see here. Thank you, be right back. You are very welcome you have a good one. Did we give you like a breakdown of the bill or anything? [Client] Alright. A O C A D D O Valley, Arkansas. Y'all probably can beat those prices too I think. [Agent] Yeah. [Client] Mhm thanks. [Agent] Anything else we will be able to do for you today? [Client] Yeah. [Agent] XXXX that would be on the first bill. So also we are going to have to send us. It is like a release form that the customer pretty much has to sign to give us permission to pull the number from the current provider. Mhm. Got you, you know, we do not have anything later either. [Client] Yeah, for for the alcohol board we have to have it because we have a bar inside there. OK. [Agent] Perfect. [Client] OK. [Agent] Yeah, that is a lot for landline. [Client] there is is supposed to be one gig I am usually not there until we open that, and we open, it is an evening business, so. [Agent] Perfect. [Client] So if so I would like to see the pricing and possibly switch to it. You know, Yeah it is with no features. And how does it work with Uh, canceling with them, does it automatically cancel when the number gets switched over, or? I guess landline. I am just, I am fed up with them, you know, because it is a phone that is never used, you know, it is just gouging is all it is. Is it like uh Mhm. [Agent] But I will definitely put a note in here. [Client] And that is that is the cheapest that is without any features added to it or anything, correct? [Agent] Uh, so let us see here, so what is going to be the phone number that you are bringing over? I will send you information with that as well with the. Yeah, for those phones you will not be able to technically bring them over Well right now, for example, if you have one line for mobile service it is XX monthly if you have two lines, it is XX for each line and if you have X plus then it drops down to XX per line. [Client] we are glad to not have to use the satellite one anymore but uh [Agent] Perfect. [Client] That is that is why I was uh questioning. Uh, coming to a point Uh, I have your high speed uh internet in our business, and I am calling to see if, if it is possible. [Agent] Movie. Are you still possibly looking for more information with the mobile lines? XX $40 and there is no additional surcharges or fees or like that that would be the flat rate just local taxes on top of it, including tax will probably come out to about $46 and change for the phone line. Yeah, the number has to be in a fully working active condition. Oh wow. [Client] Would it run more per month of course or? [Agent] That is the best thing to do So our phone service would be $40 monthly with unlimited talk and text. And last thing for security purposes, can you also verify the four digit access code on the account? [Client] Mhm. [Agent] And then once the install is done is when you call AT&T and stop the service. [Client] Right, OK. XXX. Can do something better. Yeah I know, no, he told me not to because he goes on a landline phone if you do that, but they are going to install it on Wednesday. Uh, Do you guys also, uh, cover landlines for phones? And I called them and, and told them that uh and my mom's like XX years old and had the business was closed down for the whole COVID thing. OK, alright, I will, I will try to be close to the business that day. XXXX No, I appreciate you guys thank you. Our calls go through our cell phones basically. they have landline XX bucks a month. OK. Bye. Yeah, no, no, that is fine. I do not know what happened to the line but uh they they charge over $100 a month for for just landline service and so I am trying to see if I I I I know anyone else is going to beat that, but I just wanted to call you guys first and see what pricing so you are saying it would be what was it again a month additional. But uh that sounds good though. [Agent] 40 [Client] You know, Mhm. [Agent] How may I help you? [Client] It is XXX. You too. OK. [Agent] That would be the lowest price, yes, but that is including about XX calling features, call forwarding, voicemail, um, the find me feature as well, caller ID, any particular features you are looking for? [Client] Yeah, they have been gals like XXX, XXX bucks a month something like that that they have been charging. I think the last bill, and I do not know if it is been like this for a while, but it is like $178 a month and that is just for landline phone line it is ridiculous. Movie martinis, yes. [Agent] So I am going to just place you on a brief hold, get this part started, and we will take it from there. So we can come out that day to do the install. And just to let you know as well, you do qualify for promotions with faster speed of internet also have you guys ever considered an upgrading the Internet speed at the location? [Client] OK. [Agent] Of course. Oh wow. [Client] XXXXX [Agent] Would that time work for you? [Client] OK. But uh What do I need to do next to try to set it up with you guys? [Agent] Compared to how many devices you might be using. Perfect thank you. [Client] Since we opened X years ago just because it was mandatory but we never use it and in fact the, the telephone reception is terrible there. That is fine. [Agent] So let us see here how many phone lines would you need? Um, and then I will see when the number's going to be released from them. [Client] OK. No, that is, that is Uh XX. [Agent] Let us take a look at your account. Oh, and also we are going to send you what is called letter of authorization. [Client] OK. Yes. I wish that uh we had your service here in the hot springs where we live because we had to go through cable links. [Agent] And let us see here. [Client] Can they call this number like XX minutes? [Agent] I am glad to hear we would definitely have other options for you in the future if you are looking into it. No patient. Yes, we do have business landline phone service. [Client] OK. [Agent] Perfect thank you and can you verify the name of the business? Let us see here and we do have the option of bringing the number over as well. [Client] OK. [Agent] And of course it is unlimited talk, text and data as well. [Client] Um, no, um. I thought it was already on the one gig but uh. [Agent] You are welcome. I believe it is movemartins@aol.com. [Client] Yeah, oK. [Agent] Would you like me to send that to the email address on file? Let us see here it would be a one time set up fee of.","chambliss, desmond",desmond.chambliss@optimum.com,102 crystal palace dr,caddo valley,ar,71923.0

[Agent] So that is where the confirmation email for this is going to go to I am just working on this for you, OK? So we would only be contacting them uh for the numbers that we are reporting sometimes for whatever reason customers have numbers on different bills so I just want to make the processes seamless for you. OK, so you just have one line with AT&T? You would also get a connection back up with it. [Client] Let me see what this says. Good thanks the Lord. [Agent] OK and then did you have any other accounts that you needed my assistance with? Do you have a separate number for the fax or is it OK, so it is the same number. So while the switch between Optimum and AT&T is being made, there would be no downtime or lapse in service. [Client] We will see. [Agent] So what I am going to do to when reviewing your account, you do qualify for some speed upgrades as well because you guys have a XXX by XX which we no longer offer [Client] Yeah, that is it, no.

[Agent] you are a medical business so we could probably put you in an upgrade as well with the phone bear with me, OK [Client] Hang on, there is a little bit little bitty black box. [Agent] I mean it it it would just be giving you a faster speed, ma'am so it is not if you were to add just the phone lines minus the speed, so say if we did not even increase the speed and we just added the two phone lines, I will tell you it would be because I actually gave you a promotion with the speed increase so it would be $80 plus there is a XXX. [Client] No, no, no, no, yeah, yeah, I do too [Agent] You have not lost me. [Client] It is it is Clink box. [Agent] OK, uh, bear with me, and then may I ask with the AT&T bill is the XXX-XXXX your billing telephone number with them? I have XXXXXXXXXX correct [Client] Get down there I am Well, I see this, OK. [Agent] there is no contracts [Client] Right Thank you for calling Internet TTD. It makes a lot of sense, but I do not understand why you have to increase the speed and all that bull crap when it works fine. Please say. [Agent] That is correct, ma'am. [Client] Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah. Close enough. So my total is probably going to run what? It dropped the internet dropped it, yeah, OK, got you. [Agent] I am just pulling up the account information now. I have XXXXXX-XXXX [Client] Yeah. I switched the house out to Optimum. [Agent] So you get call waiting, call forwarding, X way calling, caller ID, roll over, XXXX. [Client] Right. If yes, press X. OK, alrighty. [Agent] Uh, let us see the first available date that they would release the lines to us, and then you will let me know what works for you, OK? OK, so do you want to do Tuesday the 29th, 11th to X? You are doing great So right now we have a deal where if you pour in two lines, it is $2 for the price of one [Client] Please enter the XX digit telephone number that you want to enroll followed by the pound key. OK OK Yeah, I got you. [Agent] Yeah, that was, that was me with the typo. Yes. So XXX, yes, and then once, yes, that is correct. [Client] Mhm. [Agent] OK, and then I can have the technician phone you prior to coming out so you have a better ETA. [Client] I do not know Do y'all Yeah I will call AT&T and tell them you are porting over the phone number and everything. [Agent] Oh, so you have a backup. Yes ma'am, we would be sending out an experienced technician. then you will let me know what works good for you because you are the customer [Client] XX,XXX. [Agent] How about 7:25, that is Friday, we could do XX to X [Client] Yeah. [Agent] Yes ma'am. I will give you the best contact number to call back in case you need to cancel or reschedule or make any changes [Client] Um, AT&T just keeps dropping everything and we just, you know, they leave us stranded for a whole day of work, you know, no phone, no internet, no nothing. [Agent] Cause you are getting some dis Um, it could have been that maybe you had called them and gave it as an alternate, do you think? You would also get premium protection with that. [Client] Oh Lord It would be more like. Well, I got cell phones out the water too, but yeah. You may now bring the customer on the line. [Agent] Oh no. XXX XXXX. So just so you know you got extended so you have the TV. [Client] It should have been the office. OK, I will put your name Dana. [Agent] No, I understand. [Client] Well, what is so strange is I had a the the lady called me last night from AT&T supposedly saying they needed to they were going to cut off my AT&T. [Agent] So it is going from XXX down and XX up to X gigabyte download, so you are getting X times faster speed, which is more in line with what most medical practices would use [Client] We are not as busy. [Agent] And for account security, may I have your X digit access code? I am going to look at that because then if you do decide to upgrade to phones in the future you will get a bigger discount with the higher speed as well so it it may not cost you, you know, it may save you some money in the long run is what we are trying to do so, uh. Good afternoon. [Client] Plus XX. [Agent] OK. [Client] XX,XXX. [Agent] I do not see broadcasting. OK, so you do have a cable box in front of me said they said uh. Oh, you got it? [Client] Dang, I was saving money, not spending it. Got you. I got to tell him Good lord, uh, no, besides the house account, I am good there, um, but I just, I just upgraded that one.

[Client] Uh, you know, Larry's just Doctor Larry Horn, D R L A R R Y H O R N. [Agent] Yes, so this would be adding the phone, so this would be adding the phone to our service and increasing the speed that you have with us. [Client] I called this morning, so. To re-enter, press X. [Agent] I am going to take a look right now just bear with me [Client] That is why I called. Please press X for English, X for Spanish.

[Agent] And then lastly what I have to do is get you over to what we call a XPV to confirm these numbers that we are reporting and they will give you a confirmation, OK? OK. [Client] Uh, the fax is on that it is everything's plugged in together. [Agent] Is that your main phone number? [Client] He is going to yes, I do That is that is the main issue. [Agent] OK, let us see what we can do. So when I put the numbers in the system it is just going to ask me like uh the AT&T so that that is why I am asking you. [Client] My husband's going to ask me. [Agent] I think I typed in something wrong bear with me. How does that sound? [Client] Let us begin. [Agent] Oh, OK, so XX,XXX is what you are paying for XX, so it would be a savings because the change in the monthly rate. [Client] No, what, what I could have it with them too. [Agent] XXX XX. [Client] Please enter the XX digit telephone number that you want to enroll followed by the pound key. [Agent] OK. [Client] Uh, Tuesdays and Thursdays work best for us. Yes. I do not know what the deal was. Yeah, yeah, that is correct. [Agent] And then we contact AT&T once again just to ensure that there is no lapse in service because you are a business. I am sorry. [Client] With fees and everything. [Agent] Does does that make sense or? Sorry, just wanted to make sure that we covered everything. You have not lost me. [Client] Great, I have one more too. If correct, press X. X or X. [Agent] My name is Dana. I can put you in a more business class speed, uh, say if you were to go with a X gigabyte speed, that is X gigabyte down XX up, so that is actually X times faster than what you currently have. [Client] I need it ported over to this account. Alrighty. [Agent] So say if there was an optimum outage [Client] So what is it after the pro so what is it after the promotion? [Agent] But other than that you are pretty much set and I wish you and your husband continued success with your practice. any additional lines, ma'am [Client] Yeah. [Agent] Tell me when you are ready for that. And then we would call AT&T, ma'am and let them know that you are switching. [Client] The increase Go ahead. No. Oh, I know you I know you are. [Agent] I am just running. And in case our phone call is disrupted, the best contact number for you is XXX-XXX-XXXX. [Client] If yes, press X. And So how do I get the cable box? Yeah. [Agent] I did not charge you a fee for the tech to come out because you did upgrade the service, so with the upgrade you saved the technician fee [Client] I see how that works alrighty. [Agent] So we could look at what you are paying on your mobile service and then take it from there. After X years I can tell you what the internet speed goes to [Client] So net for Optimum. XX,XXX. And see it is only XX on the internet. That is all, that is just off X. [Agent] It is not a contract you can terminate this at any time, of course we do not want you to [Client] Yes. [Agent] And then at the end of the call I am going to get you over to what we call a third party verification system. [Client] Yeah. Hi Thank you. So they know how to hook everything up, right? But what are you also dropping the internet too? [Agent] At some point? That is correct. Each, so you would be like at $90 [Client] I, that is no point of mess with two different ones. For long distance, Long Distance International EXXX, Local phone services, local toll services and porting, press X. If correct, press X. Oh, I bet that was OK. [Agent] That is I am sorry? So XXX, I will tell you what the increase on the internet would be after X years. OK, no worries. [Client] But Yeah. [Agent] you know you have the flexibility of doing whatever you like [Client] I do not know what he is got on that stupid thing. [Agent] OK, and we offer mobile as well too, so if you were to bundle with our mobile service you can actually save some money as well. Uh I just want to make sure I got everything. we can do Monday the 28th, ma'am, XX to X, Tuesday the 29th, Thursday the 30th if you want to look at your calendar and tell me what works best for you Um Alright, I would like to just recap everything with you and then I am going to get you over to our X PV system. Oh, OK, so XXX um XXXX, so it is actually two numbers that you need to bring over XXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX correct? [Client] OK, yes, correct. Yeah, I saw that the other day when I was in there getting um a uh a modem for the house. [Agent] OK, because I got super quiet on you. [Client] Hm. [Agent] once you go to X, the cost per line would be like $25 per line, so you would add the lines go down [Client] We bill everything here at the office XXX West Grove. [Agent] Do you guys have something that is what we call grandfathered. [Client] The phone, so I need. [Agent] And this is XXX West of the Grove Street? [Client] From AT&T and I need to keep the same number, is that possible? [Agent] Well, just so, just so you know, even after X years, ma'am, there is a whole department in place to retain you as a customer. You got it. [Client] Um, here at the office, but she called me on my cell phone and I was not aware that my cell phone was even listed with them. Oh lord, mother's on it. [Agent] OK. Do you have any boxes as well Yes. [Client] If no, press X. Please press pound key twice to move to the next question. [Agent] OK, let me just see what we can do here. [Client] Oh, I have got several AT&T bills, believe me. [Agent] I think we have it, uh, abbreviated in El Dorado. How can I help you? [Client] Uh huh. And that is added into it or not? There is a box on there I believe. I think it was a sham [Agent] OK, thank you. So once I put the numbers in the system, the system will indicate to me the first available port date that AT&T will release the phone lines [Client] Please press the pound sign to start the verification. [Agent] Once the phone lines have been switched, you would call AT&T [Client] OK. [Agent] No, you are doing fine, and I am just going to confirm the numbers with you if that is OK. OK are you speaking with what we have you currently have with us Uh, let us see here. [Client] Yes. [Agent] Oh, so if you are increasing the speed with us then maybe you could do away with the Internet with them because we are providing you with the backup solution and a higher speed. [Client] XXX X OK. [Agent] OK, so what I am going to do, sure, go ahead. [Client] Dana, this is Sandra Horn. [Agent] So say if there was an optimum outage, ma'am, you are still able to process credit cards and things of that nature. [Client] You must answer all the questions in order for us to process your request. Yeah. [Agent] We are going to be upgrading you to our phone service and upgrading your internet as well because you guys have something that we no longer offer. No worries ma'am allow me a moment I am going to get you over to the automated system, OK? Well, he will get all of this via email to Doctor Larry Horn at gmail.com. [Client] Mhm. [Agent] I am sorry, your phone cut out. [Client] OK, I just want to be clear. [Agent] OK. [Client] do not think so. [Agent] OK, that is a nice easy one actually. I am the only Dana here. That is your estimated taxes it is XXXX. [Client] Somebody just gave it to. Thank you, appreciate you. [Agent] No, no, you are good. [Client] Of course. [Agent] Yes, yes, ma'am. And then you have two phone lines. [Client] I do not know. [Agent] That would be the increase. [Client] Whether it is for the house. The bills, the bills here just like out out the roof just just got involved a lot of stuff and I sure do not want to make a mistake and screw something up so. [Agent] you would still be able to process credit card payments, you have some form of business continuity You get premier protection with that, so it is like having your own personal geek squad at your disposal if you guys need assistance setting up your network or even like a new smart TV, that is all included with this level of service at a $30 value. OK, so you do have a bar. [Client] At gmail. [Agent] Thank you for calling Optimum for Business now offering Optimum Mobile. So the phone lines are the actual price of the phone lines. [Client] A month. [Agent] And with the speed increase, it is an upgrade offer as well. Sorry, I almost had you worry. And then may I have the number from AT&T ma'am that you would like to port to this account? [Client] Correct. This is the one I am trying to get rid of. Yeah Do you have any additional telephone numbers to enroll? Sure, yeah. [Agent] Can I have a valid email, ma'am? [Client] You have reached Anett TPV. [Agent] Uh, let me pull that up. [Client] Over and above. [Agent] So this rate would be locked in for X years. You do like. [Client] I do not even know if we are going to be open X more years. That is what I needed my AT&T bill. This call will confirm your selection of phone services and will be recorded. [Agent] We are almost set. You are also going to get a failover solution. So we are going to send a tech out we send a tech out to provision the numbers of the modem so even the modem that you have, we would have to probably swap it anyway for a voice enabled modem that can support the phone service if that makes sense. just so you know, alright [Client] That is alright. [Agent] OK, just to ensure that there is no lapse in service, I mean you are a medical business, so you want to make sure that everything is copacetic [Client] The number you entered is XXX-XXX-XXXX. Not much different. [Agent] No, no, no, and I, no, no, no, no, no, and you are going to get all of this. [Client] Oh my goodness. [Agent] It is XXX. It is month to month so all of our rates are locked in for X years without any increases, but you are not in a contract. [Client] Do you have any additional telephone numbers to enroll? It is an old TV. [Agent] Uh, sometimes when we are reporting numbers we might sell an electronic letter of authorization if that is needed, then I would send that to you via email, OK? [Client] Uh, access code XXXX. [Agent] I am going to pull that up now [Client] That me.

[Client] Right now we are just going to do just add the phone line um but also I was going to mention that our the modem we have now it only has uh two plugs for a phone line so we would need to get another one I guess. [Agent] This is Daniel. How can I help you?

Approximately how many devices are connected to the internet at the office there? [Client] Uh, but we have X computers. And then X TVs I believe. [Agent] OK. Uh, for streaming? [Client] Yes. [Agent] OK, um. It is never a lost cause in my opinion. Uh, the reason I ask, do you guys have a, do you guys have any sort of, uh, dedicated IT support or a protection on those devices because I see when you signed up, um, I do not see our business premier support and protection on here, so what that is real quick is 24/7 tech support for the office XX hours a day, X days a week you get a dedicated phone number you call in case you need anything. And the best thing about the whole thing is the protection part of it. We protect any devices you have in the office there, so your computers, your monitors, your TVs, you have cameras if you have iPads, if any of those things were to break, accidental damage, things like that, they get burnt out because of a power outage, whatever the case may be, whatever you can think of, we help you either replace or repair that. Alright, thank you for calling Optimum on business have a great day. [Client] OK. [Agent] And with TVs specifically, if your TV were to break, guess what? We are not even going to try and fix it. We are just going to send you a new one. so I do recommend possibly adding that as well along with the phone number. Um, it is only. [Client] OK, how much would that be? [Agent] So the protection, um, and support is $40 a month. And then the phone line is also $40 a month, so that would increase your bill by $80 before any tax. [Client] OK. [Agent] then if you kinda want to offset that cost a little bit um I do not see our um $40 mobile bundle discount on here because you have a gig internet service if you were to bundle in mobile, meaning if you were to bring your number over from your current provider over here to optimum mobile and connected on the back end with the compassion's account, you get $40 additional $40 off every month [Client] OK, um [Agent] Like I said, uh, you will see a one-time installation fee of XXX bucks on your next bill for the installation and um. then the cost of your cell phone line here at Omo is only $45 a month for unlimited everything, unlimited data, unlimited talk and text Um, on your internet account So if you have a, if you are thinking about getting a cell strictly for the business, uh, a lot of businesses are doing this nowadays so that way they could be more productive after hours, things like that, take messages, all that good stuff, uh, you know, you can take advantage of an extra discount here. [Client] OK, um. Could you give me X 2nd and let me talk to my director about that premier protection real quick? [Agent] Yeah Yeah, yeah, go ahead. Thank you. [Client] Uh I have a hold button here. Hm. I OK OK [Agent] Hey [Client] Mhm. [Agent] Mhm. Yes, yeah, but um. OK, yeah, the, the technician will bring um the additional phone extension. Alright, give me one second here, um, so the phone line, it is $40 additional per month. The technician will give you the phone number when he arrives to install the additional equipment. Uh, keep in mind on your very next bill, you will see a one-time installation charge of XXX bucks for the technician to go out there and install and do his thing. Um, so your bill will go from XXX to XXX with the addition. Of the additional phone. [Client] OK. [Agent] OK, quick. Almost done here. [Client] OK. I [Agent] OK Um, and by the way, I really appreciate the work that you guys do. [Client] OK. [Agent] I, I have had people in my family that struggled with, uh. Mental illness and all that good stuff so. [Client] Well Well thank you We try And basically it feels like it is a lost cause, but we just keep trying. [Agent] No, you got to keep going. [Client] It is just, you know, there is just a lot of obstacles stacked against us right now , you know, we just [Agent] Um, [Client] You got to do the best you can. [Agent] Sure. No, yeah, you are absolutely right. Um, alright, I can get someone there Friday morning if that works for you between X a.m. and XX a.m. Is that cool? [Client] That is perfect. [Agent] Alright. And what is the number for um what is the best number for the technician to call before they arrive? [Client] Um, X XXX. XXX-XXX-X. [Agent] Mhm. [Client] And someone will be here so I mean it is it is really not necessary that they call someone's always here. [Agent] Got you, yeah, got you, OK. [Client] Mm [Agent] Alright, so just a quick recap, we are adding a third phone number. technician will give you the phone number when he arrives. It will be XXX number. We have you on the schedule for Friday the 25th between X and XX. Uh, just a reminder that there will be an additional $40 to the monthly bill, so you will start to be charged $230 and that is still for your promotional period of XX months. After your promotional period is over, your rates will go up to your standard rates. Your subscription will automatically renew every single month, um, unless canceled. Now from O Mobile. There is no contracts here, so you can cancel any time, uh, by calling the number you called to reach me or if you have an online account on A.net, you can always log into your account, um, and do it that way if you choose to do that, um. [Client] OK [Agent] Do you have any further questions for me? [Client] I do not believe so. I think that'll get it taken care of. [Agent] Alright, awesome and just a reminder that if uh you do decide to bring over your mobile phone, like I said, you could save $40 here, bringing that $230 back down to $190. So essentially you are getting this landline for free if you were to bundle a mobile service the cost of your mobile service here at Optum was only $45 a month for um unlimited, unlimited everything, unlimited data, unlimited talk and texts, so, uh, you could save a bunch of money there, alright [Client] OK OK.

[Client] It looked like one. Sorry? [Agent] How can I assist your business today? Value SMV video SMV video. [Client] No, because our credit card machines are all working and they are connected to the Internet so if you are telling me they are going to go out or whatever, then I desperately need you to get somebody there if if we can not operate our business because we do not have Internet, then that is going to be a bigger problem. [Agent] I am going to go there too. [Client] OK. That is the OK, go ahead. Yeah, that is why I do not see a box. Mhm. [Agent] A time and a date for the install, I mean for a technician to come out in case if we can not restart over the phone if that makes sense from here so I will just go ahead and place that order with you to let you know and in case if they can not do it over the phone, I am going to be the one that is going to call you back to let you know they have to come out, but that is worst case scenario.","aleksandra, selman",aleksandra.selman@optimum.com,3055 highway 62,mountain home,ar,72653.0
