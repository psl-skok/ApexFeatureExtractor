[Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Requesting and um representatives come out to talk to us about um possible upgrades to our system. Um, our system came over on the dinosaurs, so therefore our phone systems. Um Will not work with none of the new phones where our phone services are going in and out Our internet is slow as myuzo, um. Even though we have XXX megabytes per second, we are still dropping out with Internet daily, um, and somebody came out and said oh it is not the modem, but the modem is like a XXXX modem."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Our system is older than that. Our phone system is older than that, so we will we would like a representative to come out to see what could be possibly done to get our systems up to date"" [Agent] ""OK. OK, and what is the address that you are speaking of?"" [Customer] ""Um, XXX South Heritage Street."" [Agent] ""And the zip code for that?"" [Customer] ""XXX-XX our phone systems are so old we can not even get phones. That can run caller ID."" [Agent] ""Now do you have phones through us do you have a separate phone system like, like do we provide the phone like the physical phones to you do y'all just purchase your own physical phone"" [Customer] ""Um No, our phones, no, I mean we have had these spring up."" [Agent] ""OK, so let me see, so you only."" [Customer] ""That is how old our system is. I mean we are using phones that work with the system that we have upstairs that is through the phone company. Our boxes and stuff and they are so oh we can not get new phones. Because they will not work with Trot. I mean we can not even get a business phone in here with caller ID because it will caller ID it these phones will not work with our system because they are so old."" [Agent] ""OK, we do have the ability to provide you with a phone system, but also looking at your account here, you do also have some older codes on the account because caller ID is a feature that everyone should have that it should easily go with it, um, now with."" [Customer] ""But that is what I am saying the system upstairs is so old. It will not allow it. The new phones to work with because the phones that we have do not have caller ID."" [Agent] ""OK, so now you are."" [Customer] ""But when we try to put a phone that like what we have got a newer phone. It will not work because our system is not compatible with the system."" [Agent] ""And who is your who is your system upstairs to?"" [Customer] ""Upstairs. Yeah But it is been here so long Optimum did not install it."" [Agent] ""Yeah, because I do not think you have any type of phone system through us. All you are going to have through us is you are going to have a modem. The modem then connects analog phones. It is not a phone system, it is just basic analog phones, um."" [Customer] ""No, I am saying is all wiring and stuff for our business lines. Which I mean we have phones for y'all like you know we get our phone. With y'all. I mean we got our phone in long distance with business features, features that we are not able to."" [Agent] ""So I mean, so we supply you because I think that might be where the confusion is we do not supply the phone system."" [Customer] ""Yeah No."" [Agent] ""Your phone system is probably just needing to be upgraded however you need to upgrade it."" [Customer] ""This stuff upstairs, that is the phone wires. All that upstairs is what is preventing us from updating our phones. And that is through the phone company. The phone company installed that."" [Agent] ""What phone company?"" [Customer] ""The one that was"" [Agent] ""Like I"" [Customer] ""Well y'all bought them out so technically yes y'all."" [Agent] ""OK. Let us see, and"" [Customer] ""I mean y'all just kind of inherited this account."" [Agent] ""So you also, you also mentioned the internet as well, the XXX meg internet."" [Customer] ""When y'all bought it."" [Agent] ""How many devices would you say you have connected to the internet?"" [Customer] ""Maybe X."" [Agent] ""Just like X computers, no personal devices, no tablets, no TVs."" [Customer] ""Um, we have. X computers. We have one camera system. And X printers that run Wi Fi and that is it."" [Agent] ""How many cameras are on the camera system?"" [Customer] ""Not that many."" [Agent] ""OK, because those count as devices too, because most businesses I do not normally recommend the XXXX. If a business comes into me, especially in automotive business that is needing to pull out quotes and loans and stuff along those lines, we normally are going to recommend a faster speed like our X gig for that."" [Customer] ""Well, like I said, our modem. It is from XXXX, but they said there is nothing wrong with it I know there is"" [Agent] ""So I mean we can offer to get you an upgrade on the account which would bring in new, a new modem, new equipment, and it would upgrade all the codes on your account."" [Customer] ""Well that is what we would like we, we really want a representative to come out so they can see what we are dealing with because we tried to beforehand and they are like oh there is not a problem, but they need to somebody needs to physically come out here that is a representative to see what we are dealing with. Because I mean technicians just look at it and say oh no there is not a problem there is a problem because we can say oh we are getting upgrades all we want like you said we are supposed to we are paying for caller ID"" [Agent] ""So I do not have"" [Customer] ""We do not have car."" [Agent] ""Well, you also have very old codes on the account. Your codes are very old because it does not look like you have ever gotten a new promotion on the account. It does not look like we have ever really upgraded the account um, so your phone codes are very old now we can offer I was looking here because I do not have the ability to send out a technician. Uh, we, I just do not, are not a technician, a representative. I do not have the ability to just send somebody out, um, but what I can do is I can offer you to upgrade the codes on your account get you into a faster speed, so you would get a brand new modem, um, let us see"" [Customer] ""What I mean why do we want to put more money in here when we can not when we are dropping completely out daily."" [Agent] ""I mean it might be that the one the the XXX does not work for you to have something lop out daily."" [Customer] ""It do not matter if I can No I mean we have had issues we have had issues for years This has nothing to do with this has to do with our equipment. And our wiring. That is what I am trying to say we do not want to put more money into something that we are still having issues with."" [Agent] ""So I mean, the only OK then all I can really offer you is to get you over to tech support."" [Customer] ""That is why we really need somebody to come out. OK, maybe somebody. OK, let us do that."" [Agent] ""Because I mean because you are in so now I can offer you Intels to get you a faster speed which is going to get you brand new equipment as well as all of our brand new equipment comes with what is called the connection backup so anytime your system does fail like you are stating it automatically turns on to keep supporting your devices. This would also update your phone codes on the account and so I mean just just looking here at what we can offer right off the bat."" [Customer] ""Because I mean we are paying $15 a month for Internet equipment. I do not even know what that is."" [Agent] ""It is your modem, your modem upstairs that supports the services."" [Customer] ""The one that we have had since XXXX."" [Agent] ""So yeah, so we can get you in a faster speed of equipment, a faster modem we can get you in that connection back up and get all of your codes updated as well as put you into a new promotion because right now you are not in any type of promotion so the the rate just is going to keep increasing because of that I mean I can offer you all of this at just an additional XXXX and then no installation charge to send out the technician to upgrade the equipment"" [Customer] ""So I mean it is like we would have all new wiring put in."" [Agent] ""So the technician comes out he is going to check your modem and change out your modem and the wiring to your modem When you say wiring, are we talking about the Ethernet cables from the modem to the phones?"" [Customer] ""No, we do not have Ethernet cables to the phones."" [Agent] ""How do you connect your phones to the equipment?"" [Customer] ""We have regular phone lines. That is how old our phones is."" [Agent] ""When you say regular. So then yeah he would update the lines as well he would update whatever needs to be updated because you are getting an upgrade."" [Customer] ""So what would that be look like a month?"" [Agent] ""Um, it looks like it would bring it up to 2:30."" [Customer] ""OK, that is something I would have to discuss with the. Owner before I can authorize that."" [Agent] ""Do you want to put me on hold and reach out to him since I mean you have got someone who is trying to help you?"" [Customer] ""Um. So what all will that entail with that extra charge?"" [Agent] ""What do you mean by that? Like what"" [Customer] ""OK, so right now we are paying about $170."" [Agent] ""Upgrades are you getting? OK. And so this would bring it up to 229.50."" [Customer] ""Yeah I am So how much is that speed?"" [Agent] ""So beforehand your XXX meg internet you are paying about XXXX. This brings it up to XXX plus we are putting additional discounts of $120 on there to cover the connection back up as well as your phone lines. So you are really, you are just seeing the additional $49.50 dollars monthly you are getting almost double the speed, the connection back up you are getting a new promotion on your account XXX megabytes per second."" [Customer] ""And so that is connection back up XXX megabytes this will completely upgrade our phone systems"" [Agent] ""Yes, he is going to come out there, he is going to upgrade the modem if the lines need to be changed as well, he will change those as well."" [Customer] ""And it is a $120. Savings."" [Agent] ""So you get a promotional discount of $120. So when he sees his bill every month, or she, whoever the owner is, and they see their bill every month, but how we price it out is you are going to see the full rates for everything, so you are going to see that $245 for the internet, you are going to see $20 for the phone, the $30 for the connection back up, and then in the end we put $120 in discounts on there to bring it down to the $229."" [Customer] ""OK, and how long is this promotion good for?"" [Agent] ""This is a X year price guarantee. It is not a contract. It is just a price guarantee for the next X years."" [Customer] ""OK, let me put you on hold."" [Agent] ""OK, thank you."" [Customer] ""XX WN Ma'am?"" [Agent] ""Yes ma'am."" [Customer] ""OK, so he said I just got off the phone with him. He said, um, what would be if we added like Internet phones? Or virtual assistants or whatever, how would that work?"" [Agent] ""So our voice over IP services is that what you are talking about?"" [Customer] ""Uh yes."" [Agent] ""OK, how many phone lines do you have? Because I am seeing that you actually only have one with us."" [Customer] ""We have X lines."" [Agent] ""What are those phone numbers?"" [Customer] ""Uh da da da da. I want to think it is XXXX and then maybe XXXX maybe."" [Agent] ""OK, let me see in the XXXX let us see. Mm mm. Now why I ask how many lines you have with us is because our voice over IP phone system requires us to have a minimum of X lines."" [Customer] ""OK, we do not have, we have, we have X phones but only X lines."" [Agent] ""Yeah same. OK, both of those numbers are on here, so you do have two phone lines with us that is correct. OK. And then what does he think about doing the upgrade with the connection back up and the new promotion?"" [Customer] ""Um, he was, you know, like I said, was wanting to know about the internet thing, but it requires X lines."" [Agent] ""Mhm. It does require X lines, yes ma'am."" [Customer] ""So for actual phone numbers."" [Agent] ""Yes, so it would be X actual phone numbers as well as with um our VoIP services. Every phone would have to have a phone number, so you mentioned you have X phones, so then it would have to have a number pointed to that phone, um, so I believe that normally, uh, so X phones and the phones run $40.80 or XX $40.95 a piece, and so if we were to do X of those."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""It would be about XXX XX."" [Customer] ""Hold on X 2nd."" [Agent] ""Yeah, take your time. And then I did want to let you know that we could do this upgrade as soon as tomorrow morning. I have an X to XX or an XX to X."" [Customer] ""So he wants to know is the 2:30 the total bill if we do not go with the Internet phones."" [Agent] ""Yes ma'am, the 2:30 would be the total bill if you do not go with the Internet phones."" [Customer] ""And what is your name? I forgot to get that."" [Agent] ""Oh Lizzie."" [Customer] ""Is it um I or Y?"" [Agent] ""Oh, you can do I."" [Customer] ""OK, so Um, you said what are the times tomorrow?"" [Agent] ""X to XX or XX to X."" [Customer] ""Let us say XX to X.""

Did you want to possibly upgrade the speed here because this address is fiber capable? We can actually upgrade you to fiber. And with the fiber you would be getting uh dedicated speeds here."" [Customer] ""So So what plan do I have right now?"" [Agent] ""You have a XXX megabits download coax connection um and about maybe XX megabits upload."" [Customer] ""Really?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, so you are at the lowest, uh, bandwidth for the coax."" [Customer] ""And how much is the uh fiber? Uh, OK, how much is the"" [Agent] ""Um, let me take a look and see what we could do here. I am just going to look at some upgrade offers. Sorry for the delay. I am just waiting for those offers to open up here. Sorry if I got quiet. I am just actually looking here for you. And then the modem rental would go away as well, bear with me. So if you were to add the phone line, sir, and upgrade to a fiber connection, the change in your monthly rate would be $80.05. So instead of $40 for the line it would be $80 you would also have the upgraded speed sir You would have a X gigabyte connection, uh, fiber, so that is X gig up, X gig down. You would be getting symmetrical speeds with the internet."" [Customer] ""Mm."" [Agent] ""And then with the fiber upgrade, you would actually save the phone the fee for the phone for the technician"" [Customer] ""Right. And What"" [Agent] ""So you would be getting uh, you know Greater speeds here, more productivity in your business."" [Customer] ""Right, uh, can we just do the, uh, uh, porting for now? I, uh, I have to leave for my other office and, uh. I will consider that in the, you know, uh, X or X days."" [Agent] ""Sure, well, the only thing is that with the porting it would be the same appointment time frame."" [Customer] ""Right now I am"" [Agent] ""If that makes sense so they could do both at the same time. And then with the upgrade you would also get a $50 gift card."" [Customer] ""Uh, Uh, no, not right now, just the, the X thing for now."" [Agent] ""OK, so the porting is the primary no worries, allow me a moment here and I am working on the date of when we can get that number for you, OK"" [Customer] ""I guess I got to go. OK."" [Agent] ""Bear with me one second."" [Customer] ""So that"" [Agent] ""Where is its own billing telephone number sir? With this current uh provider. So when you get a bill right now from your current provider, that number is the number that is associated with the bill the XXX-XXX"" [Customer] ""Yes XXX X."" [Agent] ""OK, I just want to make sure. XXX-XXXX, that is the number?"" [Customer] ""Well that is the one that we are reporting, right?"" [Agent] ""Yes, I am that is what I am confirming like when you get a bill from your other provider that is the number that is associated with the bill."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""OK. I am just running the number now through the system the system will indicate to me the first available port date, OK"" [Customer] ""XX The"" [Agent] ""We are almost set here sir sorry uh for the delay."" [Customer] ""We are all set."" [Agent] ""Uh, almost, um, the system is about to generate the first available date that that number would be available to be reported. I know you have to go, um. I am moving as quickly as possible here bear with me. So, let us see. The first available date that your provider would release that online to Optimum would be Monday the 5th of May. I could do X to XXXX to X, or X to X."" [Customer] ""Oh, is there any physical thing to do?"" [Agent] ""Yes, we actually send a technician out to provision the modem so the modem would be provisioned on site, sir"" [Customer] ""OK. Uh,"" [Agent] ""If that date does not work for you we could do Tuesday, Wednesday yeah, there is no lapse in service your number will continue to work with your current provider until then"" [Customer] ""Add the number. Oh, can we do, uh, Tuesday then?"" [Agent] ""Sure, and then what time frame did you want? X to XXXX to X, or X to X?"" [Customer] ""X to XX."" [Agent] ""And then the best contact number for the technicians to phone you, is that the number you are calling from XXXXXXX-XXXX."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""OK perfect. Let me just make sure that appointment is."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""Solidify before you go and confirm the email because what is going to happen is you are going to get what we call an electronic letter of authorization confirming the number and the email address that we have is BEBSG@aol.com."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""That is a good email? OK, just wanted to make sure so quick recap what we are doing is we are coming out."" [Customer] ""It is a good email."" [Agent] ""It is XXX South Street. This is in freehold"" [Customer] ""we are going to be adding a line The additional cost on your monthly would be $40. The one time fee, sir, for the technician to come out would be $79.99 dollars, and that is placed on the bill. You do not have to give any money. To the tech and there is no contracts and just so you are aware we do offer mobile service now for business so that is a way to save some money on your Optimum account we have unlimited mobile plans as low as $45 a month but then you would actually save $15 on your business account, OK? So it is something to, uh, keep in mind and we are part of the largest XG network. So the mobile number is good all over the state. Yes, so the network that we utilize for mobile service is T-Mobile, in case you are wondering what the network is, but it would be, it is nationwide. I have used it in Georgia, you know, uh, Florida, California, so we are, you know, nationwide the service is great Since the yeah since T-Mobile is. As free international calls, right? So no international would be handled on a per call basis you would have to add an international plan say if you were going to travel. Uh Alright, so. Uh, I do have some time right now. I am driving. OK. Uh, What is? My bill XXX when I am getting the lowest. Uh, Steve. Hold on, let us take a look here. So you are probably out of a promotion or whatever promotion that you started with originally, uh, that ended. Well, actually I, I had static IP. Mhm. And then I changed it. So it should be the lowest. Price Well, you are at the lowest bandwidth you are also out of a promotion on your account, like your actual optimum account is out of a promotion Because I changed If that makes sense. OK. I mean if you were looking to lower the bill may mobile would be one way that I could offer you a reduction on the bill by switching over your mobile service I could save you some money in other areas. So Uh, no, let us try like your standard. Basic, uh, business phone line right now this internet line. OK. How much is it? OK are you asking about new customer pricing or? Yes. OK, so if you were to do a XXX connection, that is XXX megabits down and XX or XX $50 up I should say, coax it would be $65 a month for one year. No customer price It is just a X year price guarantee and then the phone lines if you were to do a bundle, I could tell you what that would be. Bear with me. You have two phone lines. You would be looking at about $100 for one year. And then after one year it goes to the standard, uh, the standard pricing. For everything For for two lines and the uh the lowest. Uh, Internet, which is coax, that is correct sir. Correct What do you mean coax uh? Well, that is the type of connection that you have now. Well So with the coax, um, the speeds can, you know, vary depending on how many users you have utilizing the Internet, the time of day, how many devices whereas with the fiber, the fiber would be a guaranteed connection you would be getting guaranteed speeds there You would be getting symmetrical speed. How much is the fiber? So what I was offering you was a fiber upgrade, uh, the phone line and the fiber upgrade, the whole thing would have came to $80 more you would be getting, you know, more than like triple the speed of what you currently have The bonus speed. That is correct sir. But you have a XXX. Megabyte speed too, right? Like X gig is is one of your max. X gig is the fastest, uh yes, if you wanted to, did you want to hear what a XXX fiber would be Yes Yes. So we do not charge more for fiber than coax just so you know because some customers think we do um there is no we charge more for fiber so if fiber is available in your area, we would offer fiber just because it is, you know, the better connection so to speak. So We do not have any fiber in our area. You do. So that is why I quoted you fiber. You do have fiber in this area. Oh So that is why I uh quoted fiber I could tell you if you wanted to do like a XXX fiber as opposed to a gig I could tell you what that would be. Bear with me. Yes. And so where the fiber rates were coming up before and now they are not so we are just saying. If I can add man on. It is so all of the fibroids are not coming up. Uh, it is really weird. They were just coming up. Let us see if I could just tell you what the difference would be so this way if it is something you wanted to move forward with. Uh, no, no, I am more interested in pricing. Yeah, no, I know I am just trying to figure out the price because for some reason the rates are not populating now and they were earlier. I am not sure if it is because we put through the change for the phone, so I am just going to try to tell you what the rates would be and try to manually do it for you. Yes. So if you were to upgrade to like the XXX fiber, the cost difference would be $50 instead of $80. $50 a month. More, yeah, and that would be for the line and the XXX fiber. With the line Mhm. Uh Explain that. So where we be porting the phone line from your, yeah, so your bill would increase by $50 instead of $40 you would be getting the faster connection here, so you would be having a fiber connection So what is the total bill with fiber? Uh, so from XX it becomes XX. That is correct. Right? And then you add the phone line. But you That is including the phone line, sir. That is including the phone line. That is what is the monthly bill then? Let us see here, so your monthly bill now. It is just by adding the phone line, I could tell you. So your total monthly bill right now sir would be XXX. Well, can you break it down to XX? So the phone lines are $40 each. OK, so that is $80 for the voice, and then your internet, uh, let us see. XXX minus XX. Your internet charges are XXX sir. Uh, XXX, so, uh, XXX megabyte is XXX. That is correct. Right now you have a XXX megabytes coax and that is XXX. So if I choose fiber XXX. With the new uh contract, how much is that? So it is not a contract, it would be just an upgrade promotion and your bill would increase by $50 so I was giving you a promotion and that is including the phone line. So if I were to sign up. You It is XXXXX phone lines. How much is it? So if you were to do the half a gig, hold on, I will tell you. You would be with with auto pay you would be at XXX without auto pay you would be about $140 a month. With auto pay is XXX. That is correct. If you were looking to lower your overall optimum bill, you could always speak with our retention group when you had a chance, and they would be able to review your account so that is the department that would be able to maybe, uh, you know, if they could lower your bill. Retention group so I could get a lower bill. Yeah Well, I am just saying if you were looking to have it be more in line with new customer pricing. Then XXX. Uh So But later on if I if I were to support my numbers again somewhere that $40 will go away. That is correct if you poured out again, yes. Because you switch providers. Uh Right. So right now, why do not we do the uh. Fiber at XXX. OK, I am going to just get my support team on the line to assist for some reason the fiber rates are not populating for me, but I can get them on the line to see if they can assist. They could Um Yeah, is it OK if I. You can lower it further. Uh So it is an upgrade so I do not have the ability to lower the bill because this is the sales department unfortunately that is why I was saying if you were looking to get like a lower rate you could speak with our retention group. I am sorry, sir did I lose you No Oh I am here. Yeah, so did you, uh, for some reason I would have to get sales escalations involved now because now the fiber rates are not populating they were previously, uh, would it be OK if I called you back? Uh, call me back Once I have the order once I have the order placed, did you want to go ahead and upgrade uh to the the fiber because we may have to cancel, they may have to help me modify the additional or the original order to get the fiber in there for you. OK, so do you have the numbers in front of you now? Sure, I just want to confirm XXXXXXXXXX. Yeah, that is my number, yep. Yeah, I just want to confirm once I have the fiber rates added for the XXX. OK, you can call me. Yeah. Can you do it in XX minutes? Sure, I am going to reach out to my sales escalations. They are going to need to assist me. OK, I just want to make sure and then I can call you back and recap it with you. And uh. Right And your number would be XXX. It would be an XXX number, yes. It is uh which location and I will pick it up if uh. Uh, I am not sure. It is, it is just going to come through with the XXX number. It may say optimum. Alright, I will It does not say so I will just take a chance. Yeah, I will call you back shortly, sir, OK? But yeah OK Thank you. Alright have a great day."""

So if someone calls you when it is right, if someone calls you when it is busy, it rolls over to the second line."" [Customer] ""Well, well."" [Agent] ""Yep, perfect."" [Customer] ""Yeah Verizon."" [Agent] ""Now, um, who is your provider now, Verizon or AT&T? Who is your and OK, and you are not happy with them, or is the service to what is for"" [Customer] ""I Oh, no, actually I have been down for this would be X days. I have no service."" [Agent] ""Oh wow."" [Customer] ""And you can not, I can not get, you are on the phone for 2.5 hours on hold and it, it just I am not getting anywhere so I am done"" [Agent] ""Right, it is hard, no, it is hard. I mean, I am in Long Island right now, so it is local, you know, you call me in Brentwood, so it is I keep calling, so if something were to happen, you know, with us, we are there within X to X hours to fix the issue."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""We have people local all over the all over Long Island. Um, uh, you know, I am sorry for that we will definitely help you Uh, um, now the telephone numbers are called porting when you can port the telephones and keep the same telephone numbers."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""OK, that is fine. In terms of internet, are you going to have credit card machines? Are you going to have laptops?"" [Customer] ""Yeah Yeah, it is the computer and yeah, it has a credit card machine and it also has my wire service tele for that comes through it."" [Agent] ""Are you going to have a lot all the above? Mhm. Perfect. So the great thing about this location is that we offer fiber. So the fiber is extremely fast and reliable and the speed of the it is XGB which is XXXX megs upload and XXXX megs download. So pretty much extremely fast and it is fiber. I will break down the bill. um, so the internet portion of the bill is $125. And then the telephone uh $30 a line. So if you have X lines, it is $90. So it is $90 for X telephone lines and then $125 for the internet all together it is $215 a month. And then, and that is pretty much it, uh, because you get in a double play, the installation is free there are no of course fees And I can put a rush job on it and see how fast we can go and fix you know, and install the service How does that sound?"" [Customer] ""Mhm. Yeah, it is a high, it seems like."" [Agent] ""But, I mean, you are getting, you know, you are getting that, you are getting the best, you are paying for the the best service It is X gig fiber. That is why it is $125. I do not know what speed of internet you have now. Do you know what speed internet you have?"" [Customer] ""No, no."" [Agent] ""Yeah, see, with us it is one gig fiber. That is what you, I mean you are paying for it. That is why it is so, it is so strong. And if something were to happen with us in the in the situation, our modem. Has XG uh cell phone tower. So if there is an outage in the area, our modems automatically kick in and your cell phone towers for up to X hours in case we have an outage. So if that something would happen with us, we come to fix your issue within X to X hours and our cell phone our modem kicks in to uses Wi Fi towers So your credit card machines will still work even though you had a modem, even though you have an outage, whereas Verizon, you know, X or X days, look how much money you are losing by not having internet. That would not happen with us because of our, our Wi Fi modems. And uh a cell phone power modems so you are paying for the value, you know."" [Customer] ""Right, that"" [Agent] ""Now here is the situation we would have to request Verizon to give us the telephone numbers."" [Customer] ""Right"" [Agent] ""So the balls in their court in terms of how fast we can go because we we would, you know, you want to obviously keep the same telephone number that Verizon has so we have to report it called porting when we report the numbers over."" [Customer] ""I Right."" [Agent] ""So it, it is up to that. I mean, I will let you know in X minutes how fast it will release the numbers, but it is up to them to release the numbers. It might take a day, usually it takes X days for Verizon to release it sometimes too. Do you know what the XX telephone numbers are that you want to pour over?"" [Customer] ""Um, I, I only know two of them, I think. I just see like, like one is still."" [Agent] ""Sure, take your time."" [Customer] ""So one is XXX. XXXX And one is XXXXXXX. Not sure what the one is for the computer."" [Agent] ""The, the, the, when you say computer, you mean for like the credit card machine?"" [Customer] ""The credit card machine and Of the internet that comes in for tele and my wire services."" [Agent] ""OK, yeah, I think you are, I mean I do not know if you can change that number I am not sure because I know, uh, you know, if when my technician will go there he will set up the your credit card machines and all that with our service, but I am not sure if it had to be the same number it could be a new number.""

[Customer] ""I"" [Agent] ""Yeah, like um like fingers are crossed, it is up to them to release the number, you know. Hopeful it ASAP.

I have."" [Agent] ""You, you know what you can, it is up, you know what you can do."" [Customer] ""That is my big problem. My biggest holiday is in like XX days, Mother's Day. I am, I am already losing all these orders because I can not get any internet."" [Agent] ""You know what you can do? We can install the Internet ASAP. And once the internet is installed, we can port the numbers over. You know what I am saying?"" [Customer] ""Um,"" [Agent] ""So we I can put in the order let me see how, let me see how long it is just to install the internet, OK?"" [Customer] ""Yeah"" [Agent] ""Hold on. Because, because we still have to do the porting anyway I, I can get the internet there, you know, let us see if we can get the internet there as soon as possible then we can port the numbers After we install it."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""That is, you know, let me see, let me, give me a second, let me see what that does. Because Verizon does that because they do not want to lose business they do not want to lose you, you know, they do not want us. They do not want to lose you as a customer because they just wait a week."" [Customer] ""Yeah, well, the problem that, you know, I already told them that this started on Thursday."" [Agent] ""They do it all the time."" [Customer] ""Spoke to him Thursday, spoke to them Friday, literally been on the phone for over X hours on hold trying to get to speak to somebody and all you get is, you know, oh we are working on it."" [Agent] ""Mhm Yeah. It is horrible."" [Customer] ""I am like, yeah, but that is not helping me."" [Agent] ""It is not helping you right, right, right."" [Customer] ""You are not telling me what is happening and you are telling me the service will be up by X o'clock and now we are on day X and I still have no service and no one's come by or nobody's looked at it but now like nothing."" [Agent] ""Let me see if we go there and I think."" [Customer] ""My phone lines are working. It is my internet that is not working."" [Agent] ""Right, I am sorry, because, OK, so let, hold on. We can put the internet then we can port the numbers over, you know"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""We can go this Wednesday XX or X I can put a request in for tomorrow"" [Customer] ""Um, you know what, I will not be, uh, what, what is today? Today is Monday."" [Agent] ""We have Wednesday XX or X or X to X or Thursday the 1st X to XXXX."" [Customer] ""For Wednesday? Wednesday Wednesday is fine. I will be there all day Wednesday."" [Agent] ""So, so let us recap what I am going to do is I am going to install the internet and X temporary telephone numbers. Once we are installed Wednesday, then, um, we can call you can call back and say you want to port the numbers, and then we will do the process of porting the numbers over and then we can go back and port the numbers over afterwards. But for now we can just install the internet with X temporary telephone numbers so you will have service. OK."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""I am going to give you your account number. Your account number is XXX. XX-dash. XXX. XXX XX. And it is $2150 free installation for X telephone lines and the fastest internet that we offer with the Wi Fi with the backup Wi Fi. Um, and then once you are installed everything's settled, if you want to call back Thursday or Friday and say hi, I just got X temporary telephone numbers Can you do the process to report the numbers over we will do that at least for now we will"" [Customer] ""So do OK, one question, I am not even positive that other one is, or is that a telephone line or it run through the internet."" [Agent] ""It might not be a telephone line."" [Customer] ""I, I, I got a feeling it may just be run through the internet."" [Agent] ""OK, so if, if we remove the telephone, it would be cheaper. Hold on. I think so too, and you can always add it in the future if you want."" [Customer] ""I am almost Yeah."" [Agent] ""It would be cheaper. Hold on, perfect. So we are going to give you X temporary telephone numbers then once you are installed everything is working then you have time, you can call us back and say I got X temporary telephone numbers I need to port my, my Verizon numbers over.""

Um, did you want one phone number?"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Did you want two phone numbers for rollover just in case the first line is busy, it could roll over to the next line. What are we doing as far as services?"" [Customer] ""Yeah. OK, we want one number we want to roll over"" [Agent] ""OK, so basically what happens is that the system's going to generate X phone numbers in your menus and everything."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""You are just going to advertise the primary number. So when somebody calls that number, if that number is busy, it is going to roll over to the next number."" [Customer] ""OK.""

[Customer] ""OK.""

[Customer] ""OK. Yes ma'am."" [Agent] ""Beautiful. OK, perfect. So let me just make sure I bring out the right equipment and let me just put in the promos for the service.""

[Agent] ""OK, let me know when you are ready as far as the services are concerned so I can give you the pricing options then we can see how quickly we can get somebody out there for you, OK"" [Customer] ""Yes, ma'am, you are ready."" [Agent] ""Oh, beautiful. Alrighty then, so as far as the speed, the gig speed of service is the industry standard. It is basically what most businesses have, especially when you are at a restaurant, because what that does is that it allows you to run your credit cards. It allows you to do multiple businesses like DoorDash , you know, Uber Eats and get quick orders Also, if you need to set up cameras, are you going to have security camera at the location?"" [Customer] ""Yes, sir."" [Agent] ""OK, so perfect. So you have plenty of speed for your cameras as well, and if you have maybe a computer in the office to place orders, maybe you have a printer, and maybe you have a cell phone or two that needs to connect to Wi Fi. So with the gig speed of service you will have plenty of services there. Um, can you tell me how many registers you plan on having? Is it just going to be one, you are going to have X?"" [Customer] ""Register is going to be XX."" [Agent] ""OK perfect thank you so you will be able to connect that POS system, good to go. Um, as far as the phone numbers we spoke about the two lines, um, this technician's going to go out to the location. He is going to install a modem, potentially a router as well if it is not a XXX, and he is going to also install a connection wireless failover service, a modem for that. That means that if at any point there is a down on the main internet service, it will automatically switch to switch over to the LTE failover service so that your main devices, your main X devices can continue to work. That means your cameras continue to work, your credit cards continue to work until we get out there and fix the main internet service. It is all failover service so it backs it up automatically. Um, let us take a look. The installation one time charge of $100 no money due to me, no money due at the door. Everything gets billed out to you and um, as far as the monthly rate, including the two phone numbers, including the modem, the router. Your Premier technical support, your $5 your premier technical support and the connection fail over service that'll be $200. That is a X year promotion without any contracts or cancellation charges so we can definitely go ahead and um see how quickly we can get somebody out there for you. So just sit tight for me a few moments and I will advise on the installation date, OK."" [Customer] ""Mhm"" [Agent] ""The phone numbers are unlimited, so wherever you need to call, you do not have to worry, you know, wherever your providers are the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico, that is all there. I am going to need a X digit access code for your account."" [Customer] ""Mhm Just a second. What X digits would you like that to be, please? Mhm. Uh, the, the, the people who is running right now, they said that they are, they are paying only XXX per month. Same everything they have everything same and they are paying only XXX but you are saying XXX. OK, so let us go ahead and take a look and see what um they had. OK, so it is definitely not the same, um, the service, the service that they had was the basic XXX speed and that promotion that they had before, that promotion is slated to end in, well, I mean they already set up their disconnection, but that promotion was slated to end in July, so in July. That pricing structure. With that basic XXX speed, that price would have gone up to XXX to XXX. So, you are getting a faster speed? For less money than what let us say you were keeping their account, then they would have been paying come July. You would have been paying XXX for a much slower speed for a XXX meg circuit as opposed to a X gig speed of circuit. The conquest only child now you can go. Yeah. They also do not, they also do not have the failover service, meaning if that main internet is down, Automatically clicks over to that LTE network. They did not have that on the account. This is a new product that Optimum is offering, and it normally is $30 right now with the promotion as a new customer, you would be getting it for $20. And that saves a lot of money cause if for any reason, your internet is down, which is not happening very often, but whenever it does, you can not process your credit card terminals. You can not go ahead and get online. With the failover service, it automatically clicks over and uses the LTE towers to use that internet service while we fix the main one. Mhm I So that those are things that it is the the package that I am offering you is a lot more complete than what they had before. So just giving you the heads up on that and that promotion was ending in July, so it would have gone up $125 to $245. In less than X months. So you, you will not be able to reduce more than this XXXX. I can go ahead and speak to my I can go ahead and speak to my supervisor and see if there is anything that he can go ahead and do as far as the services and keeping you at, you know with the modem, the router and the failover service which is a very important part, um, bear with me just a few moments and A of Yes. Yes please. Mhm. I will go ahead and message him and see if there is anything that he can go ahead and do. To me. But we did not So you, you will, you will put the new modem everything, right, ma'am? Yes, of course, mhm, yeah, because they already disconnected their their account they put in a disconnection, yeah, they are put in the disconnection already. You replace everything, right? Yeah, oK. OK, oK, OK. OK, so you can just talk to your manager and let me know should should I be in the hold you know Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, just stay on the line, yeah, no, no, stay on the line. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I am sending him a message right now. Yes, please. Thank you. Yeah, yes. OK, just sit tight for me a couple of seconds. I appreciate it. Now they had the XXX speed. Are you hoping to stay at the gig speed of service would you want to do a XXX speed or something along the lines, um, depending on the price Oh, the one which you gave just now is XXX or XXX now. Gig, which is the equivalent of XXXX megs. That is the, that is the industry standard now. That is like what most businesses do, which is the gig speed, which is XXXX megs versus XXX megs or XXX MBs. So XXX megs is not what I would go ahead and suggest for your business type, especially if you are going to be having a camera or POS and your computer and and doing online ordering, I would not suggest that. So we can do either the price for the XX for the XXX or the XGB. Let me go ahead and. XXX Let me go ahead and work on that, bear with me just a few moments. It Oh, OK. The XXX is almost twice as fast as what they had before, so that is still a good thing and if this still is a X year promotion still with no contracts and no cancellation charges, keeping the failover service, your two phone numbers. Let us take a look here. Mhm. Because he is the one. OK, we can go ahead and provide you a XXX speed. With your modem, your router, the failover service, and the two phone numbers, and that would be XXX. OK. Yeah yeah. And that is a X year promotion, that would be a X year promotion as opposed to, yeah, that would be a X year promotion as opposed to. Mm what about. OK, uh, how much is for the XXXXX, ma'am? Um, the difference if, um, right now I could go ahead and do XXX with the the premier without the premier technical support. XXX. So basically just a second, let me just make sure that I get that price correct. Hold on, hold on, hold on. OK. That would be correct, yes, it would be XXX because all I did was take off the premier technical support. I So the difference between having the the XXX speed and the gig speed of service at this point with the discount that I am able to. Secure by removing the premier technical support, it would be $180 for the gig and $170 for the XXX speed. It is only a $10 difference for doubling the speed. That is why I always consider the gig speed of service to be the better value. It OK, just a second, hold on please. Yes ma'am, of course. Ma'am, just a quick question, so for XXX you said XXX and for X,XXX XXX, right? Yes, of course. Correct, it is only a $10 difference between the two. Different, but you said something about techni technician or something you were saying for XXX. What was that? Oh no, that was basically like there is additional products like the Premier technical support, the premier technical support, um, just like the connection fail over service is normally $30 with the premier technical support right now if you were adding it on, it would only be $20. Mhm. So when I go ahead and book our business customers. That is all part of the bundle because you get the additional discounts right now. Oh. Like if you were to add the Premier technical support, the Premier technical support helps you with networking past the demarcation point, meaning we always help you to your modem and your route. If something's not working, your modem and your router would always be checked, but if something's not working with your cameras, if something's not working with your POS system, you could call us and we can help you network it we can help you with identifying the situation and it also includes trouble calls that means that we need to send the technician out to the location and it is something that is not working on your end. You do not have to pay the trouble call, the $80 for trouble because it is already included in the Premier technical support. So those are things that most businesses nowadays have. Because not everybody can afford a um an IT guy at $120 an hour. OK Mhm OK, OK, just a second, let me explain to you. We could do that for you. We could do that, and it is only $20 a month. So if you wanted to add that premier technical support for the extra $20 that is where I came to the $200. Mhm. Hold on please, so. Yes, of course. OK, then we will go with the, with the $20 promotion as well along with that, ma'am. So you would like to go with $1000 then. OK perfect thank you so I will add up back on the. And I The premier technical support and the additional discount and what my supervisor will be able to do since we are going with this plan, he is able to go ahead and credit your installation um he is going to go ahead and give you $99.99 towards the installation only because he can not do $100 because the code needs to be there. Yeah. Mhm. So he is going to go ahead and do a no charge installation because of the fact that so that is something that he is going to be able to do, OK? Oh, OK. So it will be no charge for the install $200 for the service then the taxes are going to be $10 Thank you. List you can do that as well and that'll give you an additional $5 discount so if you want to set up auto pay and paperless, you can do that through the. Autopay for another month, $5 discounted. Yeah, it gives you, yeah, if you ever want to set up autopay and paperless, it gives you an additional $5 discount. Yeah OK. Once you are installed, you once you are installed you can go ahead and do autopay and paperless And uh OK, OK, and installation fee on the charge fundvent or done that, let us see, OK. Yeah, right now you are not going to be charged. You are only going to be charged a penny for the installation. He is crediting you the install. OK, OK. Can I please have a X digit access code for the account, please? OK. X digits that is easy for you to remember. OK, uh, uh, yeah, it is XXXX. XXXX. OK, sit tight for me just a couple of seconds. Let me see how quickly I can get somebody out there for you, OK? Just a few moments please. I appreciate your patience. Yeah, I have another question ma'am. Now I have another question. Yes, go right ahead. So, uh, do you have an, uh, do you do, do will you do the service in Wallingford as well or is only in Orange I can check the address after we finish this one. I can check the address for you. OK. Mhm. OK, sure. Thank you. Uh, yeah, one minute, one minute diaper and a diaper. Hold on, hold on. Thank for that hold on. OK, so the next, so I would suggest that we have this installed on Wednesday so that when this is not going to affect anybody else's account, so I would go ahead and have this installed on Wednesday so that you can go ahead and have your services working. Yeah. OK. Oh Can, can, can you make Can you, can you make it on Thursday? Is it possible? So we are coming there for, uh, coming on, uh, Thursday because some other people also coming for, uh yeah, so some of the service also is coming on the same day, so on I would suggest the 30th. I would suggest the 30th so you have your network running for those other things that are coming in like if you are having your cameras connected, your POS service connected, then they need the Internet service working already under your services. So it is Wednesday, 30th, right? Uh, that is what I would, yes, that is what I would suggest, because the thing is, is that a lot of the devices that you may be having connected on Thursday, they may very well need the internet to be working and if our technician gets there a little bit later, you are going to have them sitting there waiting to connect to the internet and. OK. Mhm. You know, Got you. Yeah. OK, so Wednesday what time, ma'am? I could do an X to XX and XX to X. What time frame works best for you? Uh, like, uh, uh, one o'clock or something. Well, it is either an X to XX, that means they can get there at any time between X to XX or they can get there XX to X. They will call you about XX minutes before arrival, so you tell me. XX. OK, XX to X is OK uh we will not be available to And they are going to call your husband. Yeah, but we will not be available till 12:30. That is a problem. OK, so what if I give you a X to X, does that help, does that, is that better for you? X to X is OK then uh we we need to stay there for X hours I do not know what time they will be coming. It is a X hour window anyway you look at it, but if you can not make it there until 12:30 and the technician arrives at 11:30, then you are going to miss the appointment. Yeah. So what I can suggest is tomorrow if you tell me do the X to X, tomorrow you can call in and speak to customer service and see if they can give you a better window because once this patch puts your order in. OK Tomorrow it will go ahead and say, OK, the technician is slated to arrive between X and X or 3:30 and 4:30. You can call tomorrow and then that way you can make your way there, but usually appointments are X to X, but we cut it down to X hour windows. Do you prefer the XX to X or X to X? Mhm. Yeah, uh, I will go with XX to X. OK, and tomorrow you can call in the morning, like let us say XX or you know maybe around XX o'clock and see if we could give you a better time spot, OK? OK, tomorrow, to which number should I call ma'am? Yeah Um, my apologies, not tomorrow, Wednesday, my apologies. Yeah, OK. The number is XXX. Mhm. XXX Mhm. XXXX, that is the same phone number you are going to call once you are installed to set up your username and password so you have access to the online web portal, OK? OK. Mhm. So that way you can see your features online you can set up your voicemail, you can set up your roll over that kind of thing, OK? OK. So you have to call that number anyway after you are installed, so it is a good thing that you have it right now. OK. Mhm. Let me give you your account number. OK. Let me just go ahead and confirm all the information. Remember they are going to call that XXXX phone number before they get there, OK? Mhm. So right now what we are doing is that we are scheduling an appointment for XXX Boston Post Road in Orange, Connecticut. OK. The technician is going to call about XX minutes prior to arrival on the XX to X time frame. The installation has been credited $99.99 so you will see a penny for your installation. Your monthly rate will be that $200 and your estimated taxes would be $10.84. This is going to include your gig speed of service, your modem, your router, premier technical support at the XX, your, um, connection fail over at the XX, your two phone numbers, and that is going to be for 4:30, XX between the hours of XX to X. Um, the complete terms and conditions which contain binding arbitrary provisions are available at Asharian.com/optimum terms will be sent to you via email by enrolling you agree to these important details and the terms and condition Please confirm that you would like to enroll in the premier technical support, and I just need a verbal confirmation from you, please.

Yeah, let us do this. I was going to read it back to you. Go right ahead, please. Yeah. XXXXX-XXXXXX-XX. Perfect. Thank you so so much. You are good to go. I congratulate you on your new business. Now you are going to go ahead and provide me your other address so that I can check the location for you, OK? Yeah. Yeah. Sure, uh, just have a question. OK. So the new phone number, when will I get on the same on the 30th? Ma'am, the phone number. Um, if the technician will give it to you on the date of installation. Installation. OK, got you. OK, and the second one is I have the address is XXX North Colony Road, Wallingford. Connecticut. And the zip code, please? XXXXX. XXXXX OK. Start with the ZIP code XXXXX. No, unfortunately we do not service this part of town. I apologize. Optimum is not here. OK. Um, may I go ahead and just bring one more thing to your attention, please? No. Um, I, uh, Optimum provides Optimum Mobile. Mhm. It is our cellular service. We use T-Mobile towers in the area to provide you service. Mhm. Now what we are able to do is that we are able to provide you with an unlimited line. That would go ahead and give you unlimited talk, text, and the XX gigs of premium data. Mhm That is, that is for cellphone, right? The price for that unlimited line would be $47. When you do that line for for cell phones exactly for cell phones, just in case you need it for somebody like a delivery guy or something. OK. Mhm. OK. Now if you bring in your device, you do not have to pay for a phone because if you have an older phone you just give me the IMEI number, check it out, we send you the the SIM card that is it is $47 for a cell phone. Mhm. Mhm. When you do that, you get $40 off of your internet service because you chose the gig speed of service. Yeah. So if you need to have a cell phone for the business, it is literally going to be just $7 more. OK. And I can help you do that right now as well. OK, that I have no idea. I am going to need to check with my husband. He already left to pick up my son. Mhm Um, yeah, I think maybe I can call you back in case if you are interested in that case. I can give you my email address if that is OK with you. Yes, please. Yeah, yeah. OK. Go ahead. So that would be, I am going to say it, then I am going to spell it, and then I am going to say it. Yeah. It is going to be Sandra. Mhm. Garcia at optimum.com. So it is spelled S A N D R A G A R. CIA At OPT I M U M Dot com. So if you look back, you should have Sandra. Garcia at optimum.com. OK, let me repeat. S for sun, A for Apple, N for Nancy, D for Dog, R for Rose, A for Apple, G for goat, A for apple, R for Rose, C for Cat, I for India, A for Apple. Yeah, Sandra, yep, Sandra Garcia. Correct, so far at. Yeah, O for orange, P for parrot, T for tier, I for India, M for monkey, U for umbrella, M for monkey.com. Yep, perfect. G A R C I A Garcia, perfect. So sandra. Garcia at TSA.com. So basically you can have uh a cell phone for delivery person or something like that, XX less than $10.07 dollars is what it ends up being because it is $47 including taxes then you get $40 off on this internet service Oh OK. So if you do one, so if you do $200 plus XX. That is XXX minus XXXX. OK XXX. OK. Yeah, yeah, I mean the taxes on this is $10 so you know, just reminding this but all together any way you look at it, you add $47 you take $40 away on the other side Oh, OK. Yeah. If you need two lines, if you need two lines the $45 line goes down to $30 Mhm. OK. So it is XX plus XX, so it will go ahead and be $60.64 dollars minus $40. Mhm. It will be like XX $25 for two cell phones. So there is definitely a lot of money to be saved. But OK, sure, ma'am. Exactly. So if you want to bring yours and your husband's cell phone in, we use T-Mobile towers in the area to support our Optimum mobile. OK, yeah. Yeah. Alrighty then I thank you so much for your time. You have yourself a wonderful day. Thank you for choosing Optimum and congratulations on your business. The technician will see you on Wednesday, OK? Thank you, ma'am. Thank you. Yeah. Be safe. Bye-bye. Yeah, this is your direct number? We do not have direct extensions you have my email OK.

Alright, so we are upgrading to the XXX, right, to the XGB fiber. The phones and everything are staying the same. Alright, so the X gig fiber with the product protection and what we are doing also we just rolled this out this year. It is an emergency. backup so it is a backup device that if your internet goes down this will pop on and keep your crucial items up and running, uh, very much like uh like how your cell phone switches from Wi Fi to data that is what this does. So this will keep your crucial items up and running this is a little law office Yeah. Yeah, excellent. So then your upload speed and everything for your big files, everything's going to be terrific on the uh on the X gig speed, right? And We have to swap out gear. So the difference of $310 a month, so the new bill will be XXXXX, uh, still no contracts, no installation fee, and on the day of installation, what is the best number for the tech to contact? It is sorry, uh, one second, uh, uh, is it new equipment? Yeah they are going to give you you are going to get new equipment. It is going to you are getting new better equipment as well. So it is not Uh, the equipment that we have there already installed uh, what is the maximum that you can not, uh, logically update, upgrade because I do not want, uh Well, it is really Well, just for that it is just them swapping out a modem. It is nothing, it is nothing too crazy. It is just what this is what the techs do and to make sure you have the optimal, you know, connection and everything, it is best to get the new gear. Is it possible to do it without it? Uh, for the X gig now. What about one? I could see. I can not guarantee you they usually what happens is we, they always have you roll a truck anyways to get a tech there and you know and it is the tech's decision what they are able to do. Mhm. They know that part better than me. I mean, I can look into that, but usually from the XXX and upgrading from there it is usually a modem swap. OK. Um, OK. Like if you had like the XXX you are going into a gig then it would probably be the same, you know what I mean but you are making you are going up from the XXX, so that is what it is going to be different gear. But it is quick I I am going to try Um, what is your turnaround time for something like that? Hold on a second check right now. I am going to I am going to see how quick I can get someone there, get to the schedule page It should, it should not be, should not be. That is we are not talking weeks or anything. I am trying to get someone there, you know tomorrow, the day after, so just bear with me one sec OK. Uh, then, uh-huh, Danny, uh, I am happy that on here, OK, OK, thank you. I think I can take it from here. Yeah, we, we are good for you, we just, we are just scheduling the day and whoever is going to be there, that is, that is when. OK, perfect.

X games. Yeah, that is because then you set up for the X seasons. If we need to replace the sweeper. Yeah, and again there is no contracts or anything so if you find you are not using that, you know, or you need, you know what I mean, you are definitely, I, I would not see you have an upgrade, but you can since there is no contracts you can make adjustments any time there is no penalties or anything like that and then.

Cheese, right?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, it is around there."" [Agent] ""Yeah, it is uh it is that building behind you. They are on your side of the road I have to find out what is there There is a Taco Bell beside you. They have fiber too.

Um, you can hardwire. I do not think you could hardwire with those boxes files gave you, right? They just give you Wi Fi?"" [Customer] ""Uh, no, I think we can, but, uh, I think it is just. Like I said, I just, I do not know something about it like we always have to keep resetting it. It is it is a problem."" [Agent] ""Yeah, and now, well, from what I can see is that the address you are at, we have multiple, there is multiple people using you. What, what is this here? Jazz Creations Inc. that is XXX. That is right next to you. They are using us. Uh, who else is using us?"" [Customer] ""So what is the what is the, what is the highest speed that we can get you then?"" [Agent] ""X gigabyte.""

[Agent] ""Yeah, well, I, I will tell you this, if you get it when you enroll, which is today, uh, you get it for like a fraction of the price."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So instead of calling us, let us say XX months down the line to add a number which would be about $45 right now you would get it for like $25."" [Customer] ""Right, I thought it was good."" [Agent] ""I, I am still going to look out for a better deal for you anyways. Are you going to do auto pay paperless billing?"" [Customer] ""Yeah"" [Agent] ""OK, um, I am going to try to get you this for less than XX. Let me see if I can add another promotion for you. Give me a sec."" [Customer] ""Yeah, my biggest concern, like I said is just trying to get it this week."" [Agent] ""I got you. Moment of truth is coming up. Got good news for you, my friend."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I could, I could be there Wednesday morning."" [Customer] ""That is perfect."" [Agent] ""X to XX."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""All right, uh, I did want to mention one last thing. I, I know this is some sort of lounge, um. Now we, we do offer this product it is called the pro Wi Fi. Are your guests logging into your Wi Fi?"" [Customer] ""Well, we just opened so probably yeah they would probably have that. I just do not want it we have not done it because it is been interfering with our feet so."" [Agent] ""This is exactly what the pro Wi Fi does. It is specifically for like restaurants, coffee shops, things like this. I will explain it to you. If you think it is a good fit, I, I recommend it just for these type of businesses. I am not going to recommend it for a mechanic you know, but um So let, let us say I am a guest at your lounge. Instead of me asking for your password I would see, you know, your business name I will log in. You set it up as to what you want, what information you want from your guest, you know their name, their phone number, their email, all that information gets captured, right And that gets stored. So let us say for example, I went, I signed in, you can manage how long I am on the internet for or on the Wi Fi, XX minutes, an hour, whatever the case is. And out of the X gig that we provide you, you can only limit your guests to maybe XXX Mbps or XXX, whatever the case is. That way they are not using all of your internet, if that makes sense. That is one factor. The other factor that is pretty cool is let us say you have a special on a Wednesday, you want to email blast your guest You already have my information saved. You can email me, hey, uh, Wednesday we have 50% off wine, 50% off desserts, whatever the case is It is a really cool feature. You manage it from however you want, you know. How long I could be on there for. You, you upload images of your specials on there. Let us say I went and I left and I want to take a look and go back. I could see everything. Uh, it is, and you manage it from beginning to end when a cus when a guest is there."" [Customer] ""What So we can get the name and number if they choose to um."" [Agent] ""Yeah, and you, you manage that."" [Customer] ""So whenever they log in we we can we can yeah we can get their info."" [Agent] ""You can even"" [Customer] ""What is it called again?"" [Agent] ""Oh yeah, you can, you can manage it even more. You can ask for age you know, male or female, whatever you want to add on there Those are all options. Sometimes you just want their name and phone number. Great, you want their email, you can add it. you want their age you can see what kind of age group you are getting You can add that too however you want You manage the whole thing. And then all that that is called pro Wi Fi."" [Customer] ""Right, and what is it called?"" [Agent] ""It is uh that service is 39.99."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Um, it is month to month. So let us say you tried it out and you realize, hey, you know what, we are not really using it. You can always call and remove it, you know, it will bring your bill back down to where you know And you do get a training on it, you know, our technicians show you exactly how to use it. You have a technical support team, they will help you manage it, how to upload images of your logo and things like that. It, it is pretty cool. Again, I only recommend it for like restaurants, lounges, coffee shops, things like that. Other than that, I will not recommend it to like a law office, you know uh, things of that nature"" [Customer] ""Right, no, of course."" [Agent] ""But um it is definitely a very popular option you could use it as an advertising tool as well. That would bring your bill."" [Customer] ""Alright, yeah, yeah, let us do it."" [Agent] ""So for uh and I got the phone number for less, so XXX with the number we had the pro Wi Fi XXXX XXXXX."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""OK, give me a sec. Just give me a second, we will wrap this up. Is there a specific phone number I can give the technician to call half an hour before showing up?"" [Customer] ""Yeah Oh yeah, that number is fine. I will give him I will give you another number too It is uh XXX."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""XXX-XXXX"" [Agent] ""Got it I will, I will mention one last thing. You know, I do not want to bombard you with all these specials. Um, in case you want to use a cell phone for your business, if you want to just simply text or call your guest we have unlimited talk and text for $15 OK"" [Customer] ""Mm."" [Agent] ""Um, we also have unlimited data. That is $45 but if you become an unlimited customer,"" [Customer] ""Right"" [Agent] ""Go ahead."" [Customer] ""That is for that is for separate cellphone service, right?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, that is a cell phone plan, yeah, it is called Optimum Mobile. Um, so if you become"" [Customer] ""Alright, let us let us let us hold off on that."" [Agent] ""Yeah, right, uh, that, that is what I was saying I do not want to bombard you , uh, if you do become a customer for mobile, you save $30 off of your internet bill, OK Just, just so you have that in mind."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""OK you said XXX-XXX-XXXX. Access code your four digit PIN is going to be XXXX. We are scheduled for Wednesday morning, April 30th. X to XX, did you want to enroll onto auto pay, paperless billing?"" [Customer] ""Yeah Yes."" [Agent] ""OK, let us do that.

They are going to set everything up for us. Um, we will be able to hardwire it, um then you are sending us up with the pro Wi Fi which I think is awesome"" [Agent] ""Yes sir, yeah, so there is no money up front. Your first bill is due XX days after you got installed. There is the installation fee that that install fee is 159.99."" [Customer] ""What"" [Agent] ""You do not pay the technician.

[Agent] ""Paper billing, OK, so if you were to do say a X gig speed, uh, that is X gigabyte download and X gigabyte upload with unlimited phone, uh, you would be looking at XXX a month without auto pay.""

[Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And then if you were to bundle uh your mobile service, I am not sure who you are using for mobile, but if you were to bundle your mobile service with your business account, you can actually save $40 on your business account by switching over to the Optimum mobile because we have unlimited mobile plans as low as $45 a month. And that would actually drop your business bill by $40. So if you look at the difference between the two, it is like you are almost getting a mobile line for $5 and it is unlimited talk and text. Uh, we have a deal right now where if you port in two lines, you get two lines for $45 the network we utilize is T-Mobile, so we are part of the largest XG network"" [Customer] ""Not right now.""
