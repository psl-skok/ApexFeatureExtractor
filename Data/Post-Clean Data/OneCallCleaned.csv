[Customer] ""What do you mean?"" [Agent] ""Well, you said the service is better so when you say the service is better, what about the service is better?"" [Customer] ""Like, you know, it is not off and on, you know you know what I mean"" [Agent] ""Well yeah we do get a lot of calls that people are having interruptions so are you having interruptions with your current service"" [Customer] ""Like Yeah."" [Agent] ""OK, and is that daily or you having it once in a while or here and there?"" [Customer] ""No, like, uh, every time like, uh, you know, raining, windy, you know.

[Customer] ""When the raining, they text me, you know, said, oh, maybe they, they have a issue problem, they are going to fix it maybe a couple hours, you know, when they resolve the problem, they text me back, you know. So they, I know everything, so it is easy for me, you know."" [Agent] ""Yeah. Yeah, it is interesting that you say that because we do all our packages now come with a new failover service because we have people in your area that have issues with weather and with you know having that. So what what the backup does is it allows you to maintain services even if there is an outage for up to X hours, phone and internet, so you will not be missing, uh, any sales and things like that. So, uh."" [Customer] ""Uh, the thing is I do not need the backup one. I just need the internet."" [Agent] ""OK, that is fine. OK, well, that is fine. I mean, I, you know, because you have intermittent things and people like I said in the Texas region, especially uh in the Tyler area are taking advantage. But if you do not need it, hey, you know it, you know your business. Now I wanted to ask you how much are you currently paying um for your internet package?"" [Customer] ""XXX"" [Agent] ""OK, so this is what I was going to tell you because I know that you, you know, you said you had the XXX. This is what I would like to do for you. This is definitely what I can do. So I have our gateway promo."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""It is going to give you the XXX internet. It is going to come with the gateway router modem and also it is going to come with that phone line. Um, this is going to come with a. Money back guarantee, um, we are able to. I can hook you up. I can give you the XXX internet. It is going to cover your POS systems that you have, any cameras that you add, any Wi Fi that you want to share with your customers, or even if you decide to do DoorDash in the future. This is going to be less than what you are currently paying."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""This is going to be $125 even. Um, there is a one time install of $100 if you sign up for autopay, uh, you will get a $5 discount so you can get as low as $120 just by signing up for autopay Um, I can, uh, I am just trying to see when I can get a tech out to set that up for you, and we also have additional savings with Optimum Business Mobile if you wanted to get a cell phone as well, but without the cell phone, without the auto pay, it is just XXX and um like I said I just need to know from you um who is going to be on site because we can uh come over there and install services."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Um, pretty quickly and, and upgrade you right now and get your speed way faster than it is now, uh, at a lower price."" [Customer] ""Um, XXX megabytes.""

OK, so it looks like Friday was available, but I am just looking here. I do not know if it just got blocked out or if it is still available, but for you when did you want to have services installed?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, anytime, you know, because when, when, when your, your people come to install the service work, well, I can at least connect by with my current company, you know"" [Agent] ""Yeah, that makes sense that totally makes sense so let me just confirm when we now are you are going to be there for the installation or is someone else going to be there just to confirm I just want to make sure I know who is going to be on site."" [Customer] ""It is me, you know, I, I wait until the the people come, this Friday is going to be on"" [Agent] ""OK perfect."" [Customer] ""4th, right?"" [Agent] ""Yes, so this Friday is the 4th.

[Agent] ""Sure, yeah, go ahead, ask me anything you want."" [Customer] ""It is You have XXX megabytes you said the, with the router, the modem and everything like XXX plus tech, right? Or what?"" [Agent] ""Right, it is XXX plus plus taxes, so whatever the taxes are going to be in your area, that is going to be calculated, um, so keep in mind I do not take any money from you and you do not pay the tax, so everything's going to come on a bill and it will show you the XXX and whatever taxes are available in your region because it is based on your state and your town and local things like that so we do not make the taxes, but the, the taxes are added based on uh the area of the business.""
