[Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Requesting and um representatives come out to talk to us about um possible upgrades to our system. Um, our system came over on the dinosaurs, so therefore our phone systems. Um Will not work with none of the new phones where our phone services are going in and out Our internet is slow as myuzo, um. Even though we have XXX megabytes per second, we are still dropping out with Internet daily, um, and somebody came out and said oh it is not the modem, but the modem is like a XXXX modem."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Our system is older than that. Our phone system is older than that, so we will we would like a representative to come out to see what could be possibly done to get our systems up to date"" [Agent] ""OK. OK, and what is the address that you are speaking of?"" [Customer] ""Um, XXX South Heritage Street."" [Agent] ""And the zip code for that?"" [Customer] ""XXX-XX our phone systems are so old we can not even get phones. That can run caller ID."" [Agent] ""Now do you have phones through us do you have a separate phone system like, like do we provide the phone like the physical phones to you do y'all just purchase your own physical phone"" [Customer] ""Um No, our phones, no, I mean we have had these spring up."" [Agent] ""OK, so let me see, so you only."" [Customer] ""That is how old our system is. I mean we are using phones that work with the system that we have upstairs that is through the phone company. Our boxes and stuff and they are so oh we can not get new phones. Because they will not work with Trot. I mean we can not even get a business phone in here with caller ID because it will caller ID it these phones will not work with our system because they are so old."" [Agent] ""OK, we do have the ability to provide you with a phone system, but also looking at your account here, you do also have some older codes on the account because caller ID is a feature that everyone should have that it should easily go with it, um, now with."" [Customer] ""But that is what I am saying the system upstairs is so old. It will not allow it. The new phones to work with because the phones that we have do not have caller ID."" [Agent] ""OK, so now you are."" [Customer] ""But when we try to put a phone that like what we have got a newer phone. It will not work because our system is not compatible with the system."" [Agent] ""And who is your who is your system upstairs to?"" [Customer] ""Upstairs. Yeah But it is been here so long Optimum did not install it."" [Agent] ""Yeah, because I do not think you have any type of phone system through us. All you are going to have through us is you are going to have a modem. The modem then connects analog phones. It is not a phone system, it is just basic analog phones, um."" [Customer] ""No, I am saying is all wiring and stuff for our business lines. Which I mean we have phones for y'all like you know we get our phone. With y'all. I mean we got our phone in long distance with business features, features that we are not able to."" [Agent] ""So I mean, so we supply you because I think that might be where the confusion is we do not supply the phone system."" [Customer] ""Yeah No."" [Agent] ""Your phone system is probably just needing to be upgraded however you need to upgrade it."" [Customer] ""This stuff upstairs, that is the phone wires. All that upstairs is what is preventing us from updating our phones. And that is through the phone company. The phone company installed that."" [Agent] ""What phone company?"" [Customer] ""The one that was"" [Agent] ""Like I"" [Customer] ""Well y'all bought them out so technically yes y'all."" [Agent] ""OK. Let us see, and"" [Customer] ""I mean y'all just kind of inherited this account."" [Agent] ""So you also, you also mentioned the internet as well, the XXX meg internet."" [Customer] ""When y'all bought it."" [Agent] ""How many devices would you say you have connected to the internet?"" [Customer] ""Maybe X."" [Agent] ""Just like X computers, no personal devices, no tablets, no TVs."" [Customer] ""Um, we have. X computers. We have one camera system. And X printers that run Wi Fi and that is it."" [Agent] ""How many cameras are on the camera system?"" [Customer] ""Not that many."" [Agent] ""OK, because those count as devices too, because most businesses I do not normally recommend the XXXX. If a business comes into me, especially in automotive business that is needing to pull out quotes and loans and stuff along those lines, we normally are going to recommend a faster speed like our X gig for that."" [Customer] ""Well, like I said, our modem. It is from XXXX, but they said there is nothing wrong with it I know there is"" [Agent] ""So I mean we can offer to get you an upgrade on the account which would bring in new, a new modem, new equipment, and it would upgrade all the codes on your account."" [Customer] ""Well that is what we would like we, we really want a representative to come out so they can see what we are dealing with because we tried to beforehand and they are like oh there is not a problem, but they need to somebody needs to physically come out here that is a representative to see what we are dealing with. Because I mean technicians just look at it and say oh no there is not a problem there is a problem because we can say oh we are getting upgrades all we want like you said we are supposed to we are paying for caller ID"" [Agent] ""So I do not have"" [Customer] ""We do not have car."" [Agent] ""Well, you also have very old codes on the account. Your codes are very old because it does not look like you have ever gotten a new promotion on the account. It does not look like we have ever really upgraded the account um, so your phone codes are very old now we can offer I was looking here because I do not have the ability to send out a technician. Uh, we, I just do not, are not a technician, a representative. I do not have the ability to just send somebody out, um, but what I can do is I can offer you to upgrade the codes on your account get you into a faster speed, so you would get a brand new modem, um, let us see"" [Customer] ""What I mean why do we want to put more money in here when we can not when we are dropping completely out daily."" [Agent] ""I mean it might be that the one the the XXX does not work for you to have something lop out daily."" [Customer] ""It do not matter if I can No I mean we have had issues we have had issues for years This has nothing to do with this has to do with our equipment. And our wiring. That is what I am trying to say we do not want to put more money into something that we are still having issues with."" [Agent] ""So I mean, the only OK then all I can really offer you is to get you over to tech support."" [Customer] ""That is why we really need somebody to come out. OK, maybe somebody. OK, let us do that."" [Agent] ""Because I mean because you are in so now I can offer you Intels to get you a faster speed which is going to get you brand new equipment as well as all of our brand new equipment comes with what is called the connection backup so anytime your system does fail like you are stating it automatically turns on to keep supporting your devices. This would also update your phone codes on the account and so I mean just just looking here at what we can offer right off the bat."" [Customer] ""Because I mean we are paying $15 a month for Internet equipment. I do not even know what that is."" [Agent] ""It is your modem, your modem upstairs that supports the services."" [Customer] ""The one that we have had since XXXX."" [Agent] ""So yeah, so we can get you in a faster speed of equipment, a faster modem we can get you in that connection back up and get all of your codes updated as well as put you into a new promotion because right now you are not in any type of promotion so the the rate just is going to keep increasing because of that I mean I can offer you all of this at just an additional XXXX and then no installation charge to send out the technician to upgrade the equipment"" [Customer] ""So I mean it is like we would have all new wiring put in."" [Agent] ""So the technician comes out he is going to check your modem and change out your modem and the wiring to your modem When you say wiring, are we talking about the Ethernet cables from the modem to the phones?"" [Customer] ""No, we do not have Ethernet cables to the phones."" [Agent] ""How do you connect your phones to the equipment?"" [Customer] ""We have regular phone lines. That is how old our phones is."" [Agent] ""When you say regular. So then yeah he would update the lines as well he would update whatever needs to be updated because you are getting an upgrade."" [Customer] ""So what would that be look like a month?"" [Agent] ""Um, it looks like it would bring it up to 2:30."" [Customer] ""OK, that is something I would have to discuss with the. Owner before I can authorize that."" [Agent] ""Do you want to put me on hold and reach out to him since I mean you have got someone who is trying to help you?"" [Customer] ""Um. So what all will that entail with that extra charge?"" [Agent] ""What do you mean by that? Like what"" [Customer] ""OK, so right now we are paying about $170."" [Agent] ""Upgrades are you getting? OK. And so this would bring it up to 229.50."" [Customer] ""Yeah I am So how much is that speed?"" [Agent] ""So beforehand your XXX meg internet you are paying about XXXX. This brings it up to XXX plus we are putting additional discounts of $120 on there to cover the connection back up as well as your phone lines. So you are really, you are just seeing the additional $49.50 dollars monthly you are getting almost double the speed, the connection back up you are getting a new promotion on your account XXX megabytes per second."" [Customer] ""And so that is connection back up XXX megabytes this will completely upgrade our phone systems"" [Agent] ""Yes, he is going to come out there, he is going to upgrade the modem if the lines need to be changed as well, he will change those as well."" [Customer] ""And it is a $120. Savings."" [Agent] ""So you get a promotional discount of $120. So when he sees his bill every month, or she, whoever the owner is, and they see their bill every month, but how we price it out is you are going to see the full rates for everything, so you are going to see that $245 for the internet, you are going to see $20 for the phone, the $30 for the connection back up, and then in the end we put $120 in discounts on there to bring it down to the $229."" [Customer] ""OK, and how long is this promotion good for?"" [Agent] ""This is a X year price guarantee. It is not a contract. It is just a price guarantee for the next X years."" [Customer] ""OK, let me put you on hold."" [Agent] ""OK, thank you."" [Customer] ""XX WN Ma'am?"" [Agent] ""Yes ma'am."" [Customer] ""OK, so he said I just got off the phone with him. He said, um, what would be if we added like Internet phones? Or virtual assistants or whatever, how would that work?"" [Agent] ""So our voice over IP services is that what you are talking about?"" [Customer] ""Uh yes."" [Agent] ""OK, how many phone lines do you have? Because I am seeing that you actually only have one with us."" [Customer] ""We have X lines."" [Agent] ""What are those phone numbers?"" [Customer] ""Uh da da da da. I want to think it is XXXX and then maybe XXXX maybe."" [Agent] ""OK, let me see in the XXXX let us see. Mm mm. Now why I ask how many lines you have with us is because our voice over IP phone system requires us to have a minimum of X lines."" [Customer] ""OK, we do not have, we have, we have X phones but only X lines."" [Agent] ""Yeah same. OK, both of those numbers are on here, so you do have two phone lines with us that is correct. OK. And then what does he think about doing the upgrade with the connection back up and the new promotion?"" [Customer] ""Um, he was, you know, like I said, was wanting to know about the internet thing, but it requires X lines."" [Agent] ""Mhm. It does require X lines, yes ma'am."" [Customer] ""So for actual phone numbers."" [Agent] ""Yes, so it would be X actual phone numbers as well as with um our VoIP services. Every phone would have to have a phone number, so you mentioned you have X phones, so then it would have to have a number pointed to that phone, um, so I believe that normally, uh, so X phones and the phones run $40.80 or XX $40.95 a piece, and so if we were to do X of those."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""It would be about XXX XX."" [Customer] ""Hold on X 2nd."" [Agent] ""Yeah, take your time. And then I did want to let you know that we could do this upgrade as soon as tomorrow morning. I have an X to XX or an XX to X."" [Customer] ""So he wants to know is the 2:30 the total bill if we do not go with the Internet phones."" [Agent] ""Yes ma'am, the 2:30 would be the total bill if you do not go with the Internet phones."" [Customer] ""And what is your name? I forgot to get that."" [Agent] ""Oh Lizzie."" [Customer] ""Is it um I or Y?"" [Agent] ""Oh, you can do I."" [Customer] ""OK, so Um, you said what are the times tomorrow?"" [Agent] ""X to XX or XX to X."" [Customer] ""Let us say XX to X.""

Did you want to possibly upgrade the speed here because this address is fiber capable? We can actually upgrade you to fiber. And with the fiber you would be getting uh dedicated speeds here."" [Customer] ""So So what plan do I have right now?"" [Agent] ""You have a XXX megabits download coax connection um and about maybe XX megabits upload."" [Customer] ""Really?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, so you are at the lowest, uh, bandwidth for the coax."" [Customer] ""And how much is the uh fiber? Uh, OK, how much is the"" [Agent] ""Um, let me take a look and see what we could do here. I am just going to look at some upgrade offers. Sorry for the delay. I am just waiting for those offers to open up here. Sorry if I got quiet. I am just actually looking here for you. And then the modem rental would go away as well, bear with me. So if you were to add the phone line, sir, and upgrade to a fiber connection, the change in your monthly rate would be $80.05. So instead of $40 for the line it would be $80 you would also have the upgraded speed sir You would have a X gigabyte connection, uh, fiber, so that is X gig up, X gig down. You would be getting symmetrical speeds with the internet."" [Customer] ""Mm."" [Agent] ""And then with the fiber upgrade, you would actually save the phone the fee for the phone for the technician"" [Customer] ""Right. And What"" [Agent] ""So you would be getting uh, you know Greater speeds here, more productivity in your business."" [Customer] ""Right, uh, can we just do the, uh, uh, porting for now? I, uh, I have to leave for my other office and, uh. I will consider that in the, you know, uh, X or X days."" [Agent] ""Sure, well, the only thing is that with the porting it would be the same appointment time frame."" [Customer] ""Right now I am"" [Agent] ""If that makes sense so they could do both at the same time. And then with the upgrade you would also get a $50 gift card."" [Customer] ""Uh, Uh, no, not right now, just the, the X thing for now."" [Agent] ""OK, so the porting is the primary no worries, allow me a moment here and I am working on the date of when we can get that number for you, OK"" [Customer] ""I guess I got to go. OK."" [Agent] ""Bear with me one second."" [Customer] ""So that"" [Agent] ""Where is its own billing telephone number sir? With this current uh provider. So when you get a bill right now from your current provider, that number is the number that is associated with the bill the XXX-XXX"" [Customer] ""Yes XXX X."" [Agent] ""OK, I just want to make sure. XXX-XXXX, that is the number?"" [Customer] ""Well that is the one that we are reporting, right?"" [Agent] ""Yes, I am that is what I am confirming like when you get a bill from your other provider that is the number that is associated with the bill."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""OK. I am just running the number now through the system the system will indicate to me the first available port date, OK"" [Customer] ""XX The"" [Agent] ""We are almost set here sir sorry uh for the delay."" [Customer] ""We are all set."" [Agent] ""Uh, almost, um, the system is about to generate the first available date that that number would be available to be reported. I know you have to go, um. I am moving as quickly as possible here bear with me. So, let us see. The first available date that your provider would release that online to Optimum would be Monday the 5th of May. I could do X to XXXX to X, or X to X."" [Customer] ""Oh, is there any physical thing to do?"" [Agent] ""Yes, we actually send a technician out to provision the modem so the modem would be provisioned on site, sir"" [Customer] ""OK. Uh,"" [Agent] ""If that date does not work for you we could do Tuesday, Wednesday yeah, there is no lapse in service your number will continue to work with your current provider until then"" [Customer] ""Add the number. Oh, can we do, uh, Tuesday then?"" [Agent] ""Sure, and then what time frame did you want? X to XXXX to X, or X to X?"" [Customer] ""X to XX."" [Agent] ""And then the best contact number for the technicians to phone you, is that the number you are calling from XXXXXXX-XXXX."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""OK perfect. Let me just make sure that appointment is."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""Solidify before you go and confirm the email because what is going to happen is you are going to get what we call an electronic letter of authorization confirming the number and the email address that we have is BEBSG@aol.com."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""That is a good email? OK, just wanted to make sure so quick recap what we are doing is we are coming out."" [Customer] ""It is a good email."" [Agent] ""It is XXX South Street. This is in freehold"" [Customer] ""we are going to be adding a line The additional cost on your monthly would be $40. The one time fee, sir, for the technician to come out would be $79.99 dollars, and that is placed on the bill. You do not have to give any money. To the tech and there is no contracts and just so you are aware we do offer mobile service now for business so that is a way to save some money on your Optimum account we have unlimited mobile plans as low as $45 a month but then you would actually save $15 on your business account, OK? So it is something to, uh, keep in mind and we are part of the largest XG network. So the mobile number is good all over the state. Yes, so the network that we utilize for mobile service is T-Mobile, in case you are wondering what the network is, but it would be, it is nationwide. I have used it in Georgia, you know, uh, Florida, California, so we are, you know, nationwide the service is great Since the yeah since T-Mobile is. As free international calls, right? So no international would be handled on a per call basis you would have to add an international plan say if you were going to travel. Uh Alright, so. Uh, I do have some time right now. I am driving. OK. Uh, What is? My bill XXX when I am getting the lowest. Uh, Steve. Hold on, let us take a look here. So you are probably out of a promotion or whatever promotion that you started with originally, uh, that ended. Well, actually I, I had static IP. Mhm. And then I changed it. So it should be the lowest. Price Well, you are at the lowest bandwidth you are also out of a promotion on your account, like your actual optimum account is out of a promotion Because I changed If that makes sense. OK. I mean if you were looking to lower the bill may mobile would be one way that I could offer you a reduction on the bill by switching over your mobile service I could save you some money in other areas. So Uh, no, let us try like your standard. Basic, uh, business phone line right now this internet line. OK. How much is it? OK are you asking about new customer pricing or? Yes. OK, so if you were to do a XXX connection, that is XXX megabits down and XX or XX $50 up I should say, coax it would be $65 a month for one year. No customer price It is just a X year price guarantee and then the phone lines if you were to do a bundle, I could tell you what that would be. Bear with me. You have two phone lines. You would be looking at about $100 for one year. And then after one year it goes to the standard, uh, the standard pricing. For everything For for two lines and the uh the lowest. Uh, Internet, which is coax, that is correct sir. Correct What do you mean coax uh? Well, that is the type of connection that you have now. Well So with the coax, um, the speeds can, you know, vary depending on how many users you have utilizing the Internet, the time of day, how many devices whereas with the fiber, the fiber would be a guaranteed connection you would be getting guaranteed speeds there You would be getting symmetrical speed. How much is the fiber? So what I was offering you was a fiber upgrade, uh, the phone line and the fiber upgrade, the whole thing would have came to $80 more you would be getting, you know, more than like triple the speed of what you currently have The bonus speed. That is correct sir. But you have a XXX. Megabyte speed too, right? Like X gig is is one of your max. X gig is the fastest, uh yes, if you wanted to, did you want to hear what a XXX fiber would be Yes Yes. So we do not charge more for fiber than coax just so you know because some customers think we do um there is no we charge more for fiber so if fiber is available in your area, we would offer fiber just because it is, you know, the better connection so to speak. So We do not have any fiber in our area. You do. So that is why I quoted you fiber. You do have fiber in this area. Oh So that is why I uh quoted fiber I could tell you if you wanted to do like a XXX fiber as opposed to a gig I could tell you what that would be. Bear with me. Yes. And so where the fiber rates were coming up before and now they are not so we are just saying. If I can add man on. It is so all of the fibroids are not coming up. Uh, it is really weird. They were just coming up. Let us see if I could just tell you what the difference would be so this way if it is something you wanted to move forward with. Uh, no, no, I am more interested in pricing. Yeah, no, I know I am just trying to figure out the price because for some reason the rates are not populating now and they were earlier. I am not sure if it is because we put through the change for the phone, so I am just going to try to tell you what the rates would be and try to manually do it for you. Yes. So if you were to upgrade to like the XXX fiber, the cost difference would be $50 instead of $80. $50 a month. More, yeah, and that would be for the line and the XXX fiber. With the line Mhm. Uh Explain that. So where we be porting the phone line from your, yeah, so your bill would increase by $50 instead of $40 you would be getting the faster connection here, so you would be having a fiber connection So what is the total bill with fiber? Uh, so from XX it becomes XX. That is correct. Right? And then you add the phone line. But you That is including the phone line, sir. That is including the phone line. That is what is the monthly bill then? Let us see here, so your monthly bill now. It is just by adding the phone line, I could tell you. So your total monthly bill right now sir would be XXX. Well, can you break it down to XX? So the phone lines are $40 each. OK, so that is $80 for the voice, and then your internet, uh, let us see. XXX minus XX. Your internet charges are XXX sir. Uh, XXX, so, uh, XXX megabyte is XXX. That is correct. Right now you have a XXX megabytes coax and that is XXX. So if I choose fiber XXX. With the new uh contract, how much is that? So it is not a contract, it would be just an upgrade promotion and your bill would increase by $50 so I was giving you a promotion and that is including the phone line. So if I were to sign up. You It is XXXXX phone lines. How much is it? So if you were to do the half a gig, hold on, I will tell you. You would be with with auto pay you would be at XXX without auto pay you would be about $140 a month. With auto pay is XXX. That is correct. If you were looking to lower your overall optimum bill, you could always speak with our retention group when you had a chance, and they would be able to review your account so that is the department that would be able to maybe, uh, you know, if they could lower your bill. Retention group so I could get a lower bill. Yeah Well, I am just saying if you were looking to have it be more in line with new customer pricing. Then XXX. Uh So But later on if I if I were to support my numbers again somewhere that $40 will go away. That is correct if you poured out again, yes. Because you switch providers. Uh Right. So right now, why do not we do the uh. Fiber at XXX. OK, I am going to just get my support team on the line to assist for some reason the fiber rates are not populating for me, but I can get them on the line to see if they can assist. They could Um Yeah, is it OK if I. You can lower it further. Uh So it is an upgrade so I do not have the ability to lower the bill because this is the sales department unfortunately that is why I was saying if you were looking to get like a lower rate you could speak with our retention group. I am sorry, sir did I lose you No Oh I am here. Yeah, so did you, uh, for some reason I would have to get sales escalations involved now because now the fiber rates are not populating they were previously, uh, would it be OK if I called you back? Uh, call me back Once I have the order once I have the order placed, did you want to go ahead and upgrade uh to the the fiber because we may have to cancel, they may have to help me modify the additional or the original order to get the fiber in there for you. OK, so do you have the numbers in front of you now? Sure, I just want to confirm XXXXXXXXXX. Yeah, that is my number, yep. Yeah, I just want to confirm once I have the fiber rates added for the XXX. OK, you can call me. Yeah. Can you do it in XX minutes? Sure, I am going to reach out to my sales escalations. They are going to need to assist me. OK, I just want to make sure and then I can call you back and recap it with you. And uh. Right And your number would be XXX. It would be an XXX number, yes. It is uh which location and I will pick it up if uh. Uh, I am not sure. It is, it is just going to come through with the XXX number. It may say optimum. Alright, I will It does not say so I will just take a chance. Yeah, I will call you back shortly, sir, OK? But yeah OK Thank you. Alright have a great day."""

So if someone calls you when it is right, if someone calls you when it is busy, it rolls over to the second line."" [Customer] ""Well, well."" [Agent] ""Yep, perfect."" [Customer] ""Yeah Verizon."" [Agent] ""Now, um, who is your provider now, Verizon or AT&T? Who is your and OK, and you are not happy with them, or is the service to what is for"" [Customer] ""I Oh, no, actually I have been down for this would be X days. I have no service."" [Agent] ""Oh wow."" [Customer] ""And you can not, I can not get, you are on the phone for 2.5 hours on hold and it, it just I am not getting anywhere so I am done"" [Agent] ""Right, it is hard, no, it is hard. I mean, I am in Long Island right now, so it is local, you know, you call me in Brentwood, so it is I keep calling, so if something were to happen, you know, with us, we are there within X to X hours to fix the issue."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""We have people local all over the all over Long Island. Um, uh, you know, I am sorry for that we will definitely help you Uh, um, now the telephone numbers are called porting when you can port the telephones and keep the same telephone numbers."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""OK, that is fine. In terms of internet, are you going to have credit card machines? Are you going to have laptops?"" [Customer] ""Yeah Yeah, it is the computer and yeah, it has a credit card machine and it also has my wire service tele for that comes through it."" [Agent] ""Are you going to have a lot all the above? Mhm. Perfect. So the great thing about this location is that we offer fiber. So the fiber is extremely fast and reliable and the speed of the it is XGB which is XXXX megs upload and XXXX megs download. So pretty much extremely fast and it is fiber. I will break down the bill. um, so the internet portion of the bill is $125. And then the telephone uh $30 a line. So if you have X lines, it is $90. So it is $90 for X telephone lines and then $125 for the internet all together it is $215 a month. And then, and that is pretty much it, uh, because you get in a double play, the installation is free there are no of course fees And I can put a rush job on it and see how fast we can go and fix you know, and install the service How does that sound?"" [Customer] ""Mhm. Yeah, it is a high, it seems like."" [Agent] ""But, I mean, you are getting, you know, you are getting that, you are getting the best, you are paying for the the best service It is X gig fiber. That is why it is $125. I do not know what speed of internet you have now. Do you know what speed internet you have?"" [Customer] ""No, no."" [Agent] ""Yeah, see, with us it is one gig fiber. That is what you, I mean you are paying for it. That is why it is so, it is so strong. And if something were to happen with us in the in the situation, our modem. Has XG uh cell phone tower. So if there is an outage in the area, our modems automatically kick in and your cell phone towers for up to X hours in case we have an outage. So if that something would happen with us, we come to fix your issue within X to X hours and our cell phone our modem kicks in to uses Wi Fi towers So your credit card machines will still work even though you had a modem, even though you have an outage, whereas Verizon, you know, X or X days, look how much money you are losing by not having internet. That would not happen with us because of our, our Wi Fi modems. And uh a cell phone power modems so you are paying for the value, you know."" [Customer] ""Right, that"" [Agent] ""Now here is the situation we would have to request Verizon to give us the telephone numbers."" [Customer] ""Right"" [Agent] ""So the balls in their court in terms of how fast we can go because we we would, you know, you want to obviously keep the same telephone number that Verizon has so we have to report it called porting when we report the numbers over."" [Customer] ""I Right."" [Agent] ""So it, it is up to that. I mean, I will let you know in X minutes how fast it will release the numbers, but it is up to them to release the numbers. It might take a day, usually it takes X days for Verizon to release it sometimes too. Do you know what the XX telephone numbers are that you want to pour over?"" [Customer] ""Um, I, I only know two of them, I think. I just see like, like one is still."" [Agent] ""Sure, take your time."" [Customer] ""So one is XXX. XXXX And one is XXXXXXX. Not sure what the one is for the computer."" [Agent] ""The, the, the, when you say computer, you mean for like the credit card machine?"" [Customer] ""The credit card machine and Of the internet that comes in for tele and my wire services."" [Agent] ""OK, yeah, I think you are, I mean I do not know if you can change that number I am not sure because I know, uh, you know, if when my technician will go there he will set up the your credit card machines and all that with our service, but I am not sure if it had to be the same number it could be a new number.""

[Customer] ""I"" [Agent] ""Yeah, like um like fingers are crossed, it is up to them to release the number, you know. Hopeful it ASAP.

I have."" [Agent] ""You, you know what you can, it is up, you know what you can do."" [Customer] ""That is my big problem. My biggest holiday is in like XX days, Mother's Day. I am, I am already losing all these orders because I can not get any internet."" [Agent] ""You know what you can do? We can install the Internet ASAP. And once the internet is installed, we can port the numbers over. You know what I am saying?"" [Customer] ""Um,"" [Agent] ""So we I can put in the order let me see how, let me see how long it is just to install the internet, OK?"" [Customer] ""Yeah"" [Agent] ""Hold on. Because, because we still have to do the porting anyway I, I can get the internet there, you know, let us see if we can get the internet there as soon as possible then we can port the numbers After we install it."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""That is, you know, let me see, let me, give me a second, let me see what that does. Because Verizon does that because they do not want to lose business they do not want to lose you, you know, they do not want us. They do not want to lose you as a customer because they just wait a week."" [Customer] ""Yeah, well, the problem that, you know, I already told them that this started on Thursday."" [Agent] ""They do it all the time."" [Customer] ""Spoke to him Thursday, spoke to them Friday, literally been on the phone for over X hours on hold trying to get to speak to somebody and all you get is, you know, oh we are working on it."" [Agent] ""Mhm Yeah. It is horrible."" [Customer] ""I am like, yeah, but that is not helping me."" [Agent] ""It is not helping you right, right, right."" [Customer] ""You are not telling me what is happening and you are telling me the service will be up by X o'clock and now we are on day X and I still have no service and no one's come by or nobody's looked at it but now like nothing."" [Agent] ""Let me see if we go there and I think."" [Customer] ""My phone lines are working. It is my internet that is not working."" [Agent] ""Right, I am sorry, because, OK, so let, hold on. We can put the internet then we can port the numbers over, you know"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""We can go this Wednesday XX or X I can put a request in for tomorrow"" [Customer] ""Um, you know what, I will not be, uh, what, what is today? Today is Monday."" [Agent] ""We have Wednesday XX or X or X to X or Thursday the 1st X to XXXX."" [Customer] ""For Wednesday? Wednesday Wednesday is fine. I will be there all day Wednesday."" [Agent] ""So, so let us recap what I am going to do is I am going to install the internet and X temporary telephone numbers. Once we are installed Wednesday, then, um, we can call you can call back and say you want to port the numbers, and then we will do the process of porting the numbers over and then we can go back and port the numbers over afterwards. But for now we can just install the internet with X temporary telephone numbers so you will have service. OK."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""I am going to give you your account number. Your account number is XXX. XX-dash. XXX. XXX XX. And it is $2150 free installation for X telephone lines and the fastest internet that we offer with the Wi Fi with the backup Wi Fi. Um, and then once you are installed everything's settled, if you want to call back Thursday or Friday and say hi, I just got X temporary telephone numbers Can you do the process to report the numbers over we will do that at least for now we will"" [Customer] ""So do OK, one question, I am not even positive that other one is, or is that a telephone line or it run through the internet."" [Agent] ""It might not be a telephone line."" [Customer] ""I, I, I got a feeling it may just be run through the internet."" [Agent] ""OK, so if, if we remove the telephone, it would be cheaper. Hold on. I think so too, and you can always add it in the future if you want."" [Customer] ""I am almost Yeah."" [Agent] ""It would be cheaper. Hold on, perfect. So we are going to give you X temporary telephone numbers then once you are installed everything is working then you have time, you can call us back and say I got X temporary telephone numbers I need to port my, my Verizon numbers over.""

Um, did you want one phone number?"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Did you want two phone numbers for rollover just in case the first line is busy, it could roll over to the next line. What are we doing as far as services?"" [Customer] ""Yeah. OK, we want one number we want to roll over"" [Agent] ""OK, so basically what happens is that the system's going to generate X phone numbers in your menus and everything."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""You are just going to advertise the primary number. So when somebody calls that number, if that number is busy, it is going to roll over to the next number."" [Customer] ""OK.""

[Customer] ""OK.""

[Customer] ""OK. Yes ma'am."" [Agent] ""Beautiful. OK, perfect. So let me just make sure I bring out the right equipment and let me just put in the promos for the service.""

[Agent] ""OK, let me know when you are ready as far as the services are concerned so I can give you the pricing options then we can see how quickly we can get somebody out there for you, OK"" [Customer] ""Yes, ma'am, you are ready."" [Agent] ""Oh, beautiful. Alrighty then, so as far as the speed, the gig speed of service is the industry standard. It is basically what most businesses have, especially when you are at a restaurant, because what that does is that it allows you to run your credit cards. It allows you to do multiple businesses like DoorDash , you know, Uber Eats and get quick orders Also, if you need to set up cameras, are you going to have security camera at the location?"" [Customer] ""Yes, sir."" [Agent] ""OK, so perfect. So you have plenty of speed for your cameras as well, and if you have maybe a computer in the office to place orders, maybe you have a printer, and maybe you have a cell phone or two that needs to connect to Wi Fi. So with the gig speed of service you will have plenty of services there. Um, can you tell me how many registers you plan on having? Is it just going to be one, you are going to have X?"" [Customer] ""Register is going to be XX."" [Agent] ""OK perfect thank you so you will be able to connect that POS system, good to go. Um, as far as the phone numbers we spoke about the two lines, um, this technician's going to go out to the location. He is going to install a modem, potentially a router as well if it is not a XXX, and he is going to also install a connection wireless failover service, a modem for that. That means that if at any point there is a down on the main internet service, it will automatically switch to switch over to the LTE failover service so that your main devices, your main X devices can continue to work. That means your cameras continue to work, your credit cards continue to work until we get out there and fix the main internet service. It is all failover service so it backs it up automatically. Um, let us take a look. The installation one time charge of $100 no money due to me, no money due at the door. Everything gets billed out to you and um, as far as the monthly rate, including the two phone numbers, including the modem, the router. Your Premier technical support, your $5 your premier technical support and the connection fail over service that'll be $200. That is a X year promotion without any contracts or cancellation charges so we can definitely go ahead and um see how quickly we can get somebody out there for you. So just sit tight for me a few moments and I will advise on the installation date, OK."" [Customer] ""Mhm"" [Agent] ""The phone numbers are unlimited, so wherever you need to call, you do not have to worry, you know, wherever your providers are the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico, that is all there. I am going to need a X digit access code for your account."" [Customer] ""Mhm Just a second. What X digits would you like that to be, please? Mhm. Uh, the, the, the people who is running right now, they said that they are, they are paying only XXX per month. Same everything they have everything same and they are paying only XXX but you are saying XXX. OK, so let us go ahead and take a look and see what um they had. OK, so it is definitely not the same, um, the service, the service that they had was the basic XXX speed and that promotion that they had before, that promotion is slated to end in, well, I mean they already set up their disconnection, but that promotion was slated to end in July, so in July. That pricing structure. With that basic XXX speed, that price would have gone up to XXX to XXX. So, you are getting a faster speed? For less money than what let us say you were keeping their account, then they would have been paying come July. You would have been paying XXX for a much slower speed for a XXX meg circuit as opposed to a X gig speed of circuit. The conquest only child now you can go. Yeah. They also do not, they also do not have the failover service, meaning if that main internet is down, Automatically clicks over to that LTE network. They did not have that on the account. This is a new product that Optimum is offering, and it normally is $30 right now with the promotion as a new customer, you would be getting it for $20. And that saves a lot of money cause if for any reason, your internet is down, which is not happening very often, but whenever it does, you can not process your credit card terminals. You can not go ahead and get online. With the failover service, it automatically clicks over and uses the LTE towers to use that internet service while we fix the main one. Mhm I So that those are things that it is the the package that I am offering you is a lot more complete than what they had before. So just giving you the heads up on that and that promotion was ending in July, so it would have gone up $125 to $245. In less than X months. So you, you will not be able to reduce more than this XXXX. I can go ahead and speak to my I can go ahead and speak to my supervisor and see if there is anything that he can go ahead and do as far as the services and keeping you at, you know with the modem, the router and the failover service which is a very important part, um, bear with me just a few moments and A of Yes. Yes please. Mhm. I will go ahead and message him and see if there is anything that he can go ahead and do. To me. But we did not So you, you will, you will put the new modem everything, right, ma'am? Yes, of course, mhm, yeah, because they already disconnected their their account they put in a disconnection, yeah, they are put in the disconnection already. You replace everything, right? Yeah, oK. OK, oK, OK. OK, so you can just talk to your manager and let me know should should I be in the hold you know Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, just stay on the line, yeah, no, no, stay on the line. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I am sending him a message right now. Yes, please. Thank you. Yeah, yes. OK, just sit tight for me a couple of seconds. I appreciate it. Now they had the XXX speed. Are you hoping to stay at the gig speed of service would you want to do a XXX speed or something along the lines, um, depending on the price Oh, the one which you gave just now is XXX or XXX now. Gig, which is the equivalent of XXXX megs. That is the, that is the industry standard now. That is like what most businesses do, which is the gig speed, which is XXXX megs versus XXX megs or XXX MBs. So XXX megs is not what I would go ahead and suggest for your business type, especially if you are going to be having a camera or POS and your computer and and doing online ordering, I would not suggest that. So we can do either the price for the XX for the XXX or the XGB. Let me go ahead and. XXX Let me go ahead and work on that, bear with me just a few moments. It Oh, OK. The XXX is almost twice as fast as what they had before, so that is still a good thing and if this still is a X year promotion still with no contracts and no cancellation charges, keeping the failover service, your two phone numbers. Let us take a look here. Mhm. Because he is the one. OK, we can go ahead and provide you a XXX speed. With your modem, your router, the failover service, and the two phone numbers, and that would be XXX. OK. Yeah yeah. And that is a X year promotion, that would be a X year promotion as opposed to, yeah, that would be a X year promotion as opposed to. Mm what about. OK, uh, how much is for the XXXXX, ma'am? Um, the difference if, um, right now I could go ahead and do XXX with the the premier without the premier technical support. XXX. So basically just a second, let me just make sure that I get that price correct. Hold on, hold on, hold on. OK. That would be correct, yes, it would be XXX because all I did was take off the premier technical support. I So the difference between having the the XXX speed and the gig speed of service at this point with the discount that I am able to. Secure by removing the premier technical support, it would be $180 for the gig and $170 for the XXX speed. It is only a $10 difference for doubling the speed. That is why I always consider the gig speed of service to be the better value. It OK, just a second, hold on please. Yes ma'am, of course. Ma'am, just a quick question, so for XXX you said XXX and for X,XXX XXX, right? Yes, of course. Correct, it is only a $10 difference between the two. Different, but you said something about techni technician or something you were saying for XXX. What was that? Oh no, that was basically like there is additional products like the Premier technical support, the premier technical support, um, just like the connection fail over service is normally $30 with the premier technical support right now if you were adding it on, it would only be $20. Mhm. So when I go ahead and book our business customers. That is all part of the bundle because you get the additional discounts right now. Oh. Like if you were to add the Premier technical support, the Premier technical support helps you with networking past the demarcation point, meaning we always help you to your modem and your route. If something's not working, your modem and your router would always be checked, but if something's not working with your cameras, if something's not working with your POS system, you could call us and we can help you network it we can help you with identifying the situation and it also includes trouble calls that means that we need to send the technician out to the location and it is something that is not working on your end. You do not have to pay the trouble call, the $80 for trouble because it is already included in the Premier technical support. So those are things that most businesses nowadays have. Because not everybody can afford a um an IT guy at $120 an hour. OK Mhm OK, OK, just a second, let me explain to you. We could do that for you. We could do that, and it is only $20 a month. So if you wanted to add that premier technical support for the extra $20 that is where I came to the $200. Mhm. Hold on please, so. Yes, of course. OK, then we will go with the, with the $20 promotion as well along with that, ma'am. So you would like to go with $1000 then. OK perfect thank you so I will add up back on the. And I The premier technical support and the additional discount and what my supervisor will be able to do since we are going with this plan, he is able to go ahead and credit your installation um he is going to go ahead and give you $99.99 towards the installation only because he can not do $100 because the code needs to be there. Yeah. Mhm. So he is going to go ahead and do a no charge installation because of the fact that so that is something that he is going to be able to do, OK? Oh, OK. So it will be no charge for the install $200 for the service then the taxes are going to be $10 Thank you. List you can do that as well and that'll give you an additional $5 discount so if you want to set up auto pay and paperless, you can do that through the. Autopay for another month, $5 discounted. Yeah, it gives you, yeah, if you ever want to set up autopay and paperless, it gives you an additional $5 discount. Yeah OK. Once you are installed, you once you are installed you can go ahead and do autopay and paperless And uh OK, OK, and installation fee on the charge fundvent or done that, let us see, OK. Yeah, right now you are not going to be charged. You are only going to be charged a penny for the installation. He is crediting you the install. OK, OK. Can I please have a X digit access code for the account, please? OK. X digits that is easy for you to remember. OK, uh, uh, yeah, it is XXXX. XXXX. OK, sit tight for me just a couple of seconds. Let me see how quickly I can get somebody out there for you, OK? Just a few moments please. I appreciate your patience. Yeah, I have another question ma'am. Now I have another question. Yes, go right ahead. So, uh, do you have an, uh, do you do, do will you do the service in Wallingford as well or is only in Orange I can check the address after we finish this one. I can check the address for you. OK. Mhm. OK, sure. Thank you. Uh, yeah, one minute, one minute diaper and a diaper. Hold on, hold on. Thank for that hold on. OK, so the next, so I would suggest that we have this installed on Wednesday so that when this is not going to affect anybody else's account, so I would go ahead and have this installed on Wednesday so that you can go ahead and have your services working. Yeah. OK. Oh Can, can, can you make Can you, can you make it on Thursday? Is it possible? So we are coming there for, uh, coming on, uh, Thursday because some other people also coming for, uh yeah, so some of the service also is coming on the same day, so on I would suggest the 30th. I would suggest the 30th so you have your network running for those other things that are coming in like if you are having your cameras connected, your POS service connected, then they need the Internet service working already under your services. So it is Wednesday, 30th, right? Uh, that is what I would, yes, that is what I would suggest, because the thing is, is that a lot of the devices that you may be having connected on Thursday, they may very well need the internet to be working and if our technician gets there a little bit later, you are going to have them sitting there waiting to connect to the internet and. OK. Mhm. You know, Got you. Yeah. OK, so Wednesday what time, ma'am? I could do an X to XX and XX to X. What time frame works best for you? Uh, like, uh, uh, one o'clock or something. Well, it is either an X to XX, that means they can get there at any time between X to XX or they can get there XX to X. They will call you about XX minutes before arrival, so you tell me. XX. OK, XX to X is OK uh we will not be available to And they are going to call your husband. Yeah, but we will not be available till 12:30. That is a problem. OK, so what if I give you a X to X, does that help, does that, is that better for you? X to X is OK then uh we we need to stay there for X hours I do not know what time they will be coming. It is a X hour window anyway you look at it, but if you can not make it there until 12:30 and the technician arrives at 11:30, then you are going to miss the appointment. Yeah. So what I can suggest is tomorrow if you tell me do the X to X, tomorrow you can call in and speak to customer service and see if they can give you a better window because once this patch puts your order in. OK Tomorrow it will go ahead and say, OK, the technician is slated to arrive between X and X or 3:30 and 4:30. You can call tomorrow and then that way you can make your way there, but usually appointments are X to X, but we cut it down to X hour windows. Do you prefer the XX to X or X to X? Mhm. Yeah, uh, I will go with XX to X. OK, and tomorrow you can call in the morning, like let us say XX or you know maybe around XX o'clock and see if we could give you a better time spot, OK? OK, tomorrow, to which number should I call ma'am? Yeah Um, my apologies, not tomorrow, Wednesday, my apologies. Yeah, OK. The number is XXX. Mhm. XXX Mhm. XXXX, that is the same phone number you are going to call once you are installed to set up your username and password so you have access to the online web portal, OK? OK. Mhm. So that way you can see your features online you can set up your voicemail, you can set up your roll over that kind of thing, OK? OK. So you have to call that number anyway after you are installed, so it is a good thing that you have it right now. OK. Mhm. Let me give you your account number. OK. Let me just go ahead and confirm all the information. Remember they are going to call that XXXX phone number before they get there, OK? Mhm. So right now what we are doing is that we are scheduling an appointment for XXX Boston Post Road in Orange, Connecticut. OK. The technician is going to call about XX minutes prior to arrival on the XX to X time frame. The installation has been credited $99.99 so you will see a penny for your installation. Your monthly rate will be that $200 and your estimated taxes would be $10.84. This is going to include your gig speed of service, your modem, your router, premier technical support at the XX, your, um, connection fail over at the XX, your two phone numbers, and that is going to be for 4:30, XX between the hours of XX to X. Um, the complete terms and conditions which contain binding arbitrary provisions are available at Asharian.com/optimum terms will be sent to you via email by enrolling you agree to these important details and the terms and condition Please confirm that you would like to enroll in the premier technical support, and I just need a verbal confirmation from you, please.

Yeah, let us do this. I was going to read it back to you. Go right ahead, please. Yeah. XXXXX-XXXXXX-XX. Perfect. Thank you so so much. You are good to go. I congratulate you on your new business. Now you are going to go ahead and provide me your other address so that I can check the location for you, OK? Yeah. Yeah. Sure, uh, just have a question. OK. So the new phone number, when will I get on the same on the 30th? Ma'am, the phone number. Um, if the technician will give it to you on the date of installation. Installation. OK, got you. OK, and the second one is I have the address is XXX North Colony Road, Wallingford. Connecticut. And the zip code, please? XXXXX. XXXXX OK. Start with the ZIP code XXXXX. No, unfortunately we do not service this part of town. I apologize. Optimum is not here. OK. Um, may I go ahead and just bring one more thing to your attention, please? No. Um, I, uh, Optimum provides Optimum Mobile. Mhm. It is our cellular service. We use T-Mobile towers in the area to provide you service. Mhm. Now what we are able to do is that we are able to provide you with an unlimited line. That would go ahead and give you unlimited talk, text, and the XX gigs of premium data. Mhm That is, that is for cellphone, right? The price for that unlimited line would be $47. When you do that line for for cell phones exactly for cell phones, just in case you need it for somebody like a delivery guy or something. OK. Mhm. OK. Now if you bring in your device, you do not have to pay for a phone because if you have an older phone you just give me the IMEI number, check it out, we send you the the SIM card that is it is $47 for a cell phone. Mhm. Mhm. When you do that, you get $40 off of your internet service because you chose the gig speed of service. Yeah. So if you need to have a cell phone for the business, it is literally going to be just $7 more. OK. And I can help you do that right now as well. OK, that I have no idea. I am going to need to check with my husband. He already left to pick up my son. Mhm Um, yeah, I think maybe I can call you back in case if you are interested in that case. I can give you my email address if that is OK with you. Yes, please. Yeah, yeah. OK. Go ahead. So that would be, I am going to say it, then I am going to spell it, and then I am going to say it. Yeah. It is going to be Sandra. Mhm. Garcia at optimum.com. So it is spelled S A N D R A G A R. CIA At OPT I M U M Dot com. So if you look back, you should have Sandra. Garcia at optimum.com. OK, let me repeat. S for sun, A for Apple, N for Nancy, D for Dog, R for Rose, A for Apple, G for goat, A for apple, R for Rose, C for Cat, I for India, A for Apple. Yeah, Sandra, yep, Sandra Garcia. Correct, so far at. Yeah, O for orange, P for parrot, T for tier, I for India, M for monkey, U for umbrella, M for monkey.com. Yep, perfect. G A R C I A Garcia, perfect. So sandra. Garcia at TSA.com. So basically you can have uh a cell phone for delivery person or something like that, XX less than $10.07 dollars is what it ends up being because it is $47 including taxes then you get $40 off on this internet service Oh OK. So if you do one, so if you do $200 plus XX. That is XXX minus XXXX. OK XXX. OK. Yeah, yeah, I mean the taxes on this is $10 so you know, just reminding this but all together any way you look at it, you add $47 you take $40 away on the other side Oh, OK. Yeah. If you need two lines, if you need two lines the $45 line goes down to $30 Mhm. OK. So it is XX plus XX, so it will go ahead and be $60.64 dollars minus $40. Mhm. It will be like XX $25 for two cell phones. So there is definitely a lot of money to be saved. But OK, sure, ma'am. Exactly. So if you want to bring yours and your husband's cell phone in, we use T-Mobile towers in the area to support our Optimum mobile. OK, yeah. Yeah. Alrighty then I thank you so much for your time. You have yourself a wonderful day. Thank you for choosing Optimum and congratulations on your business. The technician will see you on Wednesday, OK? Thank you, ma'am. Thank you. Yeah. Be safe. Bye-bye. Yeah, this is your direct number? We do not have direct extensions you have my email OK.

Alright, so we are upgrading to the XXX, right, to the XGB fiber. The phones and everything are staying the same. Alright, so the X gig fiber with the product protection and what we are doing also we just rolled this out this year. It is an emergency. backup so it is a backup device that if your internet goes down this will pop on and keep your crucial items up and running, uh, very much like uh like how your cell phone switches from Wi Fi to data that is what this does. So this will keep your crucial items up and running this is a little law office Yeah. Yeah, excellent. So then your upload speed and everything for your big files, everything's going to be terrific on the uh on the X gig speed, right? And We have to swap out gear. So the difference of $310 a month, so the new bill will be XXXXX, uh, still no contracts, no installation fee, and on the day of installation, what is the best number for the tech to contact? It is sorry, uh, one second, uh, uh, is it new equipment? Yeah they are going to give you you are going to get new equipment. It is going to you are getting new better equipment as well. So it is not Uh, the equipment that we have there already installed uh, what is the maximum that you can not, uh, logically update, upgrade because I do not want, uh Well, it is really Well, just for that it is just them swapping out a modem. It is nothing, it is nothing too crazy. It is just what this is what the techs do and to make sure you have the optimal, you know, connection and everything, it is best to get the new gear. Is it possible to do it without it? Uh, for the X gig now. What about one? I could see. I can not guarantee you they usually what happens is we, they always have you roll a truck anyways to get a tech there and you know and it is the tech's decision what they are able to do. Mhm. They know that part better than me. I mean, I can look into that, but usually from the XXX and upgrading from there it is usually a modem swap. OK. Um, OK. Like if you had like the XXX you are going into a gig then it would probably be the same, you know what I mean but you are making you are going up from the XXX, so that is what it is going to be different gear. But it is quick I I am going to try Um, what is your turnaround time for something like that? Hold on a second check right now. I am going to I am going to see how quick I can get someone there, get to the schedule page It should, it should not be, should not be. That is we are not talking weeks or anything. I am trying to get someone there, you know tomorrow, the day after, so just bear with me one sec OK. Uh, then, uh-huh, Danny, uh, I am happy that on here, OK, OK, thank you. I think I can take it from here. Yeah, we, we are good for you, we just, we are just scheduling the day and whoever is going to be there, that is, that is when. OK, perfect.

X games. Yeah, that is because then you set up for the X seasons. If we need to replace the sweeper. Yeah, and again there is no contracts or anything so if you find you are not using that, you know, or you need, you know what I mean, you are definitely, I, I would not see you have an upgrade, but you can since there is no contracts you can make adjustments any time there is no penalties or anything like that and then.

[Agent] ""Yeah, well, I, I will tell you this, if you get it when you enroll, which is today, uh, you get it for like a fraction of the price."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So instead of calling us, let us say XX months down the line to add a number which would be about $45 right now you would get it for like $25."" [Customer] ""Right, I thought it was good."" [Agent] ""I, I am still going to look out for a better deal for you anyways. Are you going to do auto pay paperless billing?"" [Customer] ""Yeah"" [Agent] ""OK, um, I am going to try to get you this for less than XX. Let me see if I can add another promotion for you. Give me a sec."" [Customer] ""Yeah, my biggest concern, like I said is just trying to get it this week."" [Agent] ""I got you. Moment of truth is coming up. Got good news for you, my friend."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I could, I could be there Wednesday morning."" [Customer] ""That is perfect."" [Agent] ""X to XX."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""All right, uh, I did want to mention one last thing. I, I know this is some sort of lounge, um. Now we, we do offer this product it is called the pro Wi Fi. Are your guests logging into your Wi Fi?"" [Customer] ""Well, we just opened so probably yeah they would probably have that. I just do not want it we have not done it because it is been interfering with our feet so."" [Agent] ""This is exactly what the pro Wi Fi does. It is specifically for like restaurants, coffee shops, things like this. I will explain it to you. If you think it is a good fit, I, I recommend it just for these type of businesses. I am not going to recommend it for a mechanic you know, but um So let, let us say I am a guest at your lounge. Instead of me asking for your password I would see, you know, your business name I will log in. You set it up as to what you want, what information you want from your guest, you know their name, their phone number, their email, all that information gets captured, right And that gets stored. So let us say for example, I went, I signed in, you can manage how long I am on the internet for or on the Wi Fi, XX minutes, an hour, whatever the case is. And out of the X gig that we provide you, you can only limit your guests to maybe XXX Mbps or XXX, whatever the case is. That way they are not using all of your internet, if that makes sense. That is one factor. The other factor that is pretty cool is let us say you have a special on a Wednesday, you want to email blast your guest You already have my information saved. You can email me, hey, uh, Wednesday we have 50% off wine, 50% off desserts, whatever the case is It is a really cool feature. You manage it from however you want, you know. How long I could be on there for. You, you upload images of your specials on there. Let us say I went and I left and I want to take a look and go back. I could see everything. Uh, it is, and you manage it from beginning to end when a cus when a guest is there."" [Customer] ""What So we can get the name and number if they choose to um."" [Agent] ""Yeah, and you, you manage that."" [Customer] ""So whenever they log in we we can we can yeah we can get their info."" [Agent] ""You can even"" [Customer] ""What is it called again?"" [Agent] ""Oh yeah, you can, you can manage it even more. You can ask for age you know, male or female, whatever you want to add on there Those are all options. Sometimes you just want their name and phone number. Great, you want their email, you can add it. you want their age you can see what kind of age group you are getting You can add that too however you want You manage the whole thing. And then all that that is called pro Wi Fi."" [Customer] ""Right, and what is it called?"" [Agent] ""It is uh that service is 39.99."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Um, it is month to month. So let us say you tried it out and you realize, hey, you know what, we are not really using it. You can always call and remove it, you know, it will bring your bill back down to where you know And you do get a training on it, you know, our technicians show you exactly how to use it. You have a technical support team, they will help you manage it, how to upload images of your logo and things like that. It, it is pretty cool. Again, I only recommend it for like restaurants, lounges, coffee shops, things like that. Other than that, I will not recommend it to like a law office, you know uh, things of that nature"" [Customer] ""Right, no, of course."" [Agent] ""But um it is definitely a very popular option you could use it as an advertising tool as well. That would bring your bill."" [Customer] ""Alright, yeah, yeah, let us do it."" [Agent] ""So for uh and I got the phone number for less, so XXX with the number we had the pro Wi Fi XXXX XXXXX."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""OK, give me a sec. Just give me a second, we will wrap this up. Is there a specific phone number I can give the technician to call half an hour before showing up?"" [Customer] ""Yeah Oh yeah, that number is fine. I will give him I will give you another number too It is uh XXX."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""XXX-XXXX"" [Agent] ""Got it I will, I will mention one last thing. You know, I do not want to bombard you with all these specials. Um, in case you want to use a cell phone for your business, if you want to just simply text or call your guest we have unlimited talk and text for $15 OK"" [Customer] ""Mm."" [Agent] ""Um, we also have unlimited data. That is $45 but if you become an unlimited customer,"" [Customer] ""Right"" [Agent] ""Go ahead."" [Customer] ""That is for that is for separate cellphone service, right?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, that is a cell phone plan, yeah, it is called Optimum Mobile. Um, so if you become"" [Customer] ""Alright, let us let us let us hold off on that."" [Agent] ""Yeah, right, uh, that, that is what I was saying I do not want to bombard you , uh, if you do become a customer for mobile, you save $30 off of your internet bill, OK Just, just so you have that in mind."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""OK you said XXX-XXX-XXXX. Access code your four digit PIN is going to be XXXX. We are scheduled for Wednesday morning, April 30th.

Um, we will be able to hardwire it, um then you are sending us up with the pro Wi Fi which I think is awesome"" [Agent] ""Yes sir, yeah, so there is no money up front. Your first bill is due XX days after you got installed. There is the installation fee that that install fee is 159.99."" [Customer] ""What"" [Agent] ""You do not pay the technician.

Mhm. OK. I have a question, how much is it going to be for Um, one phone line and to create internet, fast, like fast internet."" [Agent] ""Sure, and in terms of the Internet, like how many users you are going to have?"" [Customer] ""How many users?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, like how many devices you are going to have."" [Customer] ""Um, Multiple I am not, I am not sure right now, but I am going to do like is there a certain number that I need or?"" [Agent] ""No, well, it depends. The internet speed depends on what you are going to have connected to the Internet or what you are going to be using the internet for."" [Customer] ""So I am going to have I am going to have X computers right now connected"" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""But it might be more later."" [Agent] ""Sure, I mean, well, what I can suggest is what I can tell you what most billing companies would normally start with, um, so regardless of whatever speed you go with, it is going to be fast and at this location we do offer fiber, meaning you can have guaranteed speeds whereas with the coax sometimes the speeds they fluctuate depending on how many users and things."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Mhm. Yeah, how much would it be if I get with fiber?"" [Agent] ""Uh, so we do not charge more for fiber than coax, so if fiber is available we would just automatically quote you the better service"" [Customer] ""Oh OK."" [Agent] ""Does that make sense?"" [Customer] ""I would say yeah, yeah, 100%."" [Agent] ""Yeah, no, so because we, you know, we want you to have the best service, so I will tell you, hold on."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I got you."" [Agent] ""So if you were to go with say our fiber, sir, like a fiber X gig speed, that is X gigabyte down. And X gigabyte up and that would also come with unlimited voice."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""You get unlimited calls to anywhere in the US, Canada, as well as Puerto Rico."" [Customer] ""Oh Hello?"" [Agent] ""All of your calling amenities would be included with. You would also get like a battery back up with that so say if there was an optimum."" [Customer] ""Well, Michael, myco, can you, can you, can you repeat that? You disconnected for a second. You said that Costa Rica was the last thing that I heard."" [Agent] ""OK, oh no, so you get unlimited calls to anywhere in the US, Canada, as well as Puerto Rico, so you get all of your calling amenities at no extra cost."" [Customer] ""Uh huh Alright, OK, I got you."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so that comes with our service then you would also get a connection back up"" [Customer] ""You know Mhm."" [Agent] ""So say in the event there was like an optimum outage, you would not be without, uh, internet service, so you would still be able to process credit card payments, which is key because you are a billing company. So if you can not, you know, take money in, then you are losing money at that point, OK?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, 100%, yeah."" [Agent] ""And then you would also get a premium protection with that. So if you needed assistance setting up your security, all of that, that would all be included. You would be looking at $155 a month, sir."" [Customer] ""Mhm. XXX a month."" [Agent] ""Yeah, and if you did auto pay you would be at XXX."" [Customer] ""No, I say XXX, OK."" [Agent] ""Mhm and no contracts month to month you can terminate this at any time then what is the name you would like to set this up under"" [Customer] ""Alright I got Um, What is the name I should put it on this place. Let I mean, I do not know. Just put number equipment."" [Agent] ""Sure, what is the name you would like to use, sir?"" [Customer] ""Lynbrook equipment."" [Agent] ""OK, got you. Like the city? And then equipment"" [Customer] ""Like yeah, Lynbrook, yeah, and then equipment, yeah."" [Agent] ""And then who would be the authorized person, so that would be you?""

Y E H D A and then your last name, sir?"" [Customer] ""No, no, no, it is Y."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""E H U like umbrella and then B A."" [Agent] ""Oh, I am so sorry. I told and I I am so sorry you and then DA"" [Customer] ""No, you are good you are good"" [Agent] ""I am so sorry. And then your last name?"" [Customer] ""Yeah yeah It is K H A I M O V."" [Agent] ""OK, and the best contact number, sir, is it this number that you are phoning from the XXX thank you."" [Customer] ""Yeah. XXX-XXXX"" [Agent] ""And then did you want to authorize anybody else Yehuda other than yourself?"" [Customer] ""No, just me for now."" [Agent] ""then in the future sir if you decide that you want to add someone you can then may I have your tax ID associated with your business"" [Customer] ""Oh yeah, give me one second, let me see where one sec."" [Agent] ""X seconds, take your time. And if you do not have it, sir, I can always get over for now."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I, I can not find it right now."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so it is not going to be something that is going to hold us back."" [Customer] ""I was looking for it."" [Agent] ""We can update later then where can I send you a confirmation email, sir, with all of this information"" [Customer] ""Alright perfect. Alright, so you can send it to COOL. YAN at gmail.com. XX@gmail.com."" [Agent] ""Uh Oh, that is an easy one, so I will repeat it just for accuracy."" [Customer] ""Yeah, so."" [Agent] ""So it is C O L L Y A N X."" [Customer] ""X, XXs, XX's like cool."" [Agent] ""XX, OK."" [Customer] ""Yeah, so C XX L Y A N."" [Agent] ""So, And then XX at gmail.com."" [Customer] ""XX Yeah."" [Agent] ""The coolen"" [Customer] ""Yeah, XX at gmail.com."" [Agent] ""Basically. Got you. And then the mailing address or is it the same as the service address?"" [Customer] ""The mailing address is XXXX."" [Agent] ""OK, so what would you like to use as a X digit access code here for account security like a pin?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, XXX X."" [Agent] ""OK, so that is why we asked for the tax ID. We do not do anything with it. Uh, so say if you were to call in, we would say what is the last four of the tax ID or what is the PIN, OK?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, I got you."" [Agent] ""Alright and then did you already take possession of your business location, sir?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, I have it."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I want to know when somebody would be able to come in to set everything up."" [Agent] ""Bear with me. Sure Sure, let me take a look and then you will tell me what works for you. I am working on this for you right now."" [Customer] ""Not a problem."" [Agent] ""And then did you want the auto pay option sir did you want to enroll yourself You tell me how you would like to work that."" [Customer] ""Um, is there any way I can do auto payment later?"" [Agent] ""Yes, uh, you can."" [Customer] ""Yeah, so Mhm."" [Agent] ""Some customers like to enroll themselves, so when you get your confirmation email, it just would not reflect your $5 auto pay, but you can add it at any time, sir, just so you know, OK?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, no problem. Yeah, I got you."" [Agent] ""I know sometimes you need to set up your business banking account and things of that nature so you may want to add it later."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""So you have the flexibility of doing whatever you like. And then just bear with me. I am just working on the date for you then we will be all set"" [Customer] ""So that XXX $150 a month, that is with the one line in the uh internet, right?"" [Agent] ""That is correct sir.""

[Agent] ""Well, you can I just wanted you to know that if you were to add the mobile service you could actually save $40 a month by switching over to our mobile service because with the Optimum we do offer business mobile, so we have mobile plans as low as $45 a month and then you would actually save $40 on your business account, so we have unlimited talk and text plans then you save $40 on your business account, sir"" [Customer] ""Mhm. Alright, OK, I will let you know if anything I will call back to add it."" [Agent] ""Which is significant because you know it is $40 then we even have a deal where if you poured in two lines you are getting two for the price of X then there is the saving"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""Alright, I got you. For right now I am good, but if anything I will add it later."" [Agent] ""No worries, and you can add it at any time just so you are aware, OK?""

And then once you sign up for auto pay you would save the $5 so bear with me I am just working on the the date here for you then we will be all set Virus is taking so long. I am literally waiting for the date to populate."" [Customer] ""It is OK. The guy's going to add the internet jack, right?"" [Agent] ""Yes, but he is going to do the, he is going to run the line we are going to make sure that the fiber line is run then we are going to actually add uh let us see here"" [Customer] ""Uh Uh-huh.

[Customer] ""Alright, OK. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, no problem. Mhm."" [Agent] ""OK, and I am just working on the date then we will be all set here And in the meantime I will give you the account number uh you are going to get this via email but our calls here are recorded, so I will verbally tell it to you as well.""

[Agent] ""Uh, just X, so it is XXX."" [Customer] ""XXXX."" [Agent] ""No, no, no, no, it is not."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""I will, I will say it again. I will go slow. It is XXXXX."" [Customer] ""X XX OK XXXXX."" [Agent] ""Uh-huh."" [Customer] ""I got you XXX."" [Agent] ""XXXXXX sir yes."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I got you."" [Agent] ""OK, and the first available date that we can have someone is. I could do Wednesday the 30th, sir. I could do X to XXXX to X, or X to X."" [Customer] ""You can do X to XX."" [Agent] ""OK, yep, and I can have the tech, uh, phone you maybe like half an hour prior to have a better ETA of what time the tech is going to be coming out."" [Customer] ""On the 30th. Yeah, no problem."" [Agent] ""OK, and then just a quick recap what we are going to be doing is we are coming out it is XXXX Rockaway Avenue, and this is in Lynnbrook, New York, and we are going to be installing a X gig fiber connection so you are getting guaranteed speeds that is X gig up, X gig down."" [Customer] ""Yeah Mhm."" [Agent] ""You do get a fail over with that as well. So say if there is an optimum outage, you will still have business continuity. For example, you could still take payments and it, it will not affect your money or your business coming in. You also get premium protection at a $30 value. So if you need assistance setting up your cameras, your point of sale, it is all included. It is like having your own personal geek squad at your disposal."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""The one time set up fee, sir, is $100 but that is placed on the bill. You do not have to give any money to the tech there is no contracts This is a X year price guarantee. You can cancel service with us at any time."" [Customer] ""Uh, let me ask a question, you said this is for one day."" [Agent] ""Yeah we do not want you to."" [Customer] ""You said this is for one gig. Is there anything more?"" [Agent] ""Uh, so we can actually do a XGB. I will tell you what a X gig would be."" [Customer] ""Yeah, how much is the XGB going to be?"" [Agent] ""Hold on, let me tell you. And the XGB would actually give you the fastest fiber motor. So once you go XGB or XGB, it would give you the fastest modem that we offer if that makes sense."" [Customer] ""Yeah, so how much is the X gigabyte price?"" [Agent] ""Um,"" [Customer] ""The XGB price?"" [Agent] ""Sure, I am going to tell you right now, bear with me and I will try to go back and adjust it for you. So sorry, I am just going back. So if we did let us see, take away the internet, take away the one gig. Put in X days. And let me just see what the discount with the XGB would be."" [Customer] ""No, X gigabyte is fine. That is cool."" [Agent] ""OK, and the XGB it actually would be a XX month price guarantee as well."" [Customer] ""Yeah, it is OK. If anything, I will upgrade it to X gigabytes later on."" [Agent] ""Are you sure? um, because it, you know, I can."" [Customer] ""Yeah, it is OK. I am going to stick with X gigabyte for now."" [Agent] ""OK, no worries, sir, so you would be at the XXX, and is there anything else that I can help you with?"" [Customer] ""Alright, no problem. Um, no, just a quick recap. Wednesday around X to XX a.m. you said, right?"" [Agent] ""That is correct, and they will call you half an hour prior."" [Customer] ""Alright, OK, no problem perfect."" [Agent] ""Just so you have a better ETA, you will get a reminder call the night before, um, just to confirm the appointment and on the actual day of the install they will call you a half hour before so you have a better ETA, OK?"" [Customer] ""Alright, OK, no problem."" [Agent] ""I thank you so much for choosing Optimum, sir."" [Customer] ""So I got to."" [Agent] ""Is there anything else I can help with?""

[Customer] ""It is the lowest or because it is business or what is it?"" [Agent] ""Uh, so that is not the lowest, um, that would be the fastest speed that we offer if we went a step below, usually because, uh you said the X cameras I just want to make sure that you have sufficient coverage for all of your cameras, but I could tell you what it would be if you went like a step below and did like a half a gig. I could tell you what that would be with autopay as well, correct, sir?"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""So get a half a gig you would be at $105 a month, sir, with autopay.

[Agent] ""And then did you want me to enroll you in auto pay did you want to enroll in yourself"" [Customer] ""No, I want to know is, is it like I am saying is it going to be something? No, I can do it myself."" [Agent] ""OK, yeah, so because when you enroll by yourself, yep, you could do it at any time, but it will save you $5 so it will take it from $115 to $110."" [Customer] ""Like when they send me the bill, I pay."" [Agent] ""Some, some customers like to enroll themselves, so that is why, you know, I give you the choice if you want to do it yourself."" [Customer] ""Oh."" [Agent] ""OK, uh"" [Customer] ""OK, maybe I can do it later."" [Agent] ""Yeah, you could do it at any time and get that $5 discount and even if you wanted to um save some more money on your business account because I know you mentioned all these other accounts with Optimum."" [Customer] ""I can do it maybe later. That I mean, is that going to come for free?"" [Agent] ""I am not sure, but do you have like a mobile phone that you are using for business? Because we do offer mobile now for business."" [Customer] ""Oh, I have to pay more."" [Agent] ""Um, so, so you, it does not necessarily mean you have to pay more."" [Customer] ""I do not want to. Cause I only I do not I think."" [Agent] ""Um, it is we could save you money depending on what you are paying your current provider, but if you were to go with like an optimum unlimited plan, your business account, which is $115 that would come down by $45 a month."" [Customer] ""Um"" [Agent] ""So you can actually save $40. I am sorry you can actually save $40 I said $45 you can actually save $40 a month by switching over to the mobile So once you enroll in mobile, you save $40 on this account our mobile is only $45 So right now we have a deal where if you bring in two lines, we are offering two lines for $45 a month for unlimited talk and text, and then you would save $40 on your business account and you do not have to choose that option now but it is a savings and it is something that you would be, you know, entitled to, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK OK, I, I, I am sorry. I just do not want to get in. I guess let us see if I, I am trying to get a mobile."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Phone, let us say when, how much do I, uh then what, how is going to have my, my bill"" [Agent] ""So you can bring your, so you can bring your current mobile, so you do not have to buy a phone from us. You can bring a mobile phone you already have you can purchase a mobile phone through your EIN I could have somebody come for you, uh, tomorrow if you would like"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I could do X to XX or X to X."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK, but I have to buy a phone then."" [Agent] ""No, this is for the business the internet and the uh the phone not the mobile This is for the internet and the yeah, what time would you prefer"" [Customer] ""Oh yeah. I, I, I, I, I have, I have like a cell phone in my, in the business because if I, like I want to know if what how it is going to help me my bill like instead of paying XXX."" [Agent] ""So yeah, so if you, who is your who is your cell phone provider now? Is it Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile?"" [Customer] ""No, T-Mobile. I have my my T-Mobile."" [Agent] ""OK, so it is OK, so that is fine, but if you were to switch your cell phone service and link it to your business account, you could save $40."" [Customer] ""No, we do not have a phone in the business. In the business we only need the net. We do not have no phone at all."" [Agent] ""So the $115 would come down by $40 and be, does does that make sense? Um, so you could expense it through your business, yeah, and you can bring your current phone that you have if you do not want to purchase the phone."" [Customer] ""Yeah, uh-huh."" [Agent] ""So instead of paying T-Mobile, you would actually pay Optimum you would pay Optimum Mobile. We would be your mobile provider and it would be unlimited talk and text."" [Customer] ""Oh."" [Agent] ""You get unlimited calls to anywhere in the US, Canada for $45 a month."" [Customer] ""And I can use money."" [Agent] ""Yes, you."" [Customer] ""Can I use my number the same number?"" [Agent] ""Same number, same phone, yes, and then your business account would come down to $75 a month. I am sorry, I said $40 a month. Uh, yes, so you would be saving $40 a month because you have the X gig, so you would be saving $40."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""I just want to make sure I am telling you the correct savings. OK."" [Customer] ""No thank you."" [Agent] ""No worries. And then even if you do not add the mobile now, you can add it at any time and still get the same discount for the business I could come tomorrow X to XX or X to X, sir."" [Customer] ""Um, XX."" [Agent] ""OK, let me try to secure that for you because it is literally the last uh appointment that we have tomorrow. During that time frame, OK, so bear with me one second and let me go back because it has the mobile discount we are losing the mobile, I mean the uh the auto pay, you are going to do yourself you are going to enroll your own self in autopay.""

Like Uh, is there, yeah, it is an individual individual router and then it is, uh, it is. You know what I mean? It is like a number that is required for you to access remotely to a different server or a different um network.

OK, I will be in Georgia, so do they have. Maybe next week on Friday. Yes. Mhm yeah we can do next week Friday. OK. Alright, so. Alright, so this, this all in modem, all in one modem, are you sure that is going to work because what I have been, I, what I have been told is I am going to have to have a separate router. So, But I guess that is something I can get. If, if that is the case, yeah. After you hook up all your Yeah, you could get a separate wireless router on your own. I do not know why they would, uh, why you would need it. I mean, this is what most people use and, and, and, you know, especially that it comes with that static IP, um, so let me just go. Yeah. Well, basically, basically what they require is is I would, I would disconnect from my current internet and then connect to that router separate is what they are saying so. Mhm. I do not know. I will give it a shot, see if it works. No, I will just have to go get a wireless router. It is fine because they are not, they are not that expensive. OK. No, no, they are not, um, now this is going to be an installation for Friday, uh, May 9th the time frame is between XX and X. You will get uh, some appointment reminders on your phone, uh, $140 a month is your new monthly bill X gigabyte. And no contract. that is, that is as far as it goes too, right? One gig. Yeah, that, yeah, that is the highest. OK, I mean that is fast enough. I am, I am impressed with document on speed anyway so. Yeah. Yeah, it is really fast uh the only thing um um I need to do is set up a password for you has to be X numbers Mm. Uh, do XXXX. What Now I just have to let you know and ask you if you want to take advantage of these two add-ons that you can do uh with a business account you can get a backup unit. It is a failover device in case of any outage. The internet will still continue to work at a little bit slower speeds because it will use cell towers to give you internet, but it is just in case of emergency, in case of an outage. Uh, it is a $30 add on if you are interested on that. Um, I No, I am, I am not. I got, I got a hotspot on my phone, so. Uh, yeah, so basically that it would do the almost the same type of features, um, and then the other thing is uh for your phone. Right Uh No, I am not interested. I do not know who you use for your cell phone, but you because you have a business account, you have a discount, major discount with us, you get an unlimited mobile plan like a unlimited cell phone plan for just $5 So that is another perk that you can have with us. I appreciate that. OK, so with that being said, the appointment is on Friday next week between XX and X $140 a month. Uh, one gig service with a static IP equipment included as well, OK, no contract. All right. Thank you very much. Alright, Ronald, uh, oh, and the last thing you make sure once the service is installed, the business account is up and running and working, you are still responsible to call in and cancel your residential account with the service that you currently have. Oh, OK. OK. OK. All right. Alright, well enjoy the rest of your day and thanks for choosing Optimal Business. Enjoy the rest of your day. Have a good one. Alright you too thank you. Bye bye."""

[Agent] ""OK. Alright, so now your phone service is everything do you have phones set up already or"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, everything's already set up, um, you know, the phones are Internet-based phones, um, the primary services with Verizon, but you know, they service went out yesterday and we had no backup set up for the business so we are looking to get that set up."" [Agent] ""OK perfect. Got you. Right Yeah."" [Customer] ""uh, looks like, um, it says all piece on the box but that that is optimum as well, I believe, uh, is already wired into the building."" [Agent] ""Yes. Yeah, so, yeah, so it was definitely um service there previously. So what we are going to do, especially since you have connectivity issues, we rolled out a new device this year that, uh, it is an emergency connection backup. So even if that internet goes out, this internet will have a backup as well. Um, so like, um, there is, uh, uh, someone hits a pole over there. Are you, were you more near sunrise or?""

[Agent] ""OK, alright, terrific alright so. So I know we are running as a backup. So basically I, I left out off the phones or anything like that, you know the stuff we are not going to need So we have to gig into that with the emergency connection back or back up with the tech support for being a product protection. It is XXX a month goes down to X I am sorry XXX goes down to XXX a month when you do the auto pay"" [Customer] ""Mhm"" [Agent] ""Now, are is a day of install is it best for the technician to call you?"" [Customer] ""Um, yeah, that, that would be fine."" [Agent] ""OK, just want to make sure and is this number to the XXXX, is that the best number?"" [Customer] ""Yes, correct."" [Agent] ""Alright, so we will get that then we will get a date we will get you all set up here"" [Customer] ""Alright, um, what kind of, uh, internet package was it going to be and what was the cost on it?"" [Agent] ""Alright, so this is one, the one gig because if you, if you are going to have that many, uh, you are going to have that many devices you need to gig. So it is the X gig with the emergency connection backup, which is the whole reason we get this with the tech support and product protection and it is XXXX and it will go down to XXX once you do the auto pay. No contracts or anything, same thing, you know, no contracts without them. So uh, you know, you want to switch over, you want to get a second connection or anything like that, you could upgrade it to that any time."" [Customer] ""Mhm So we, we, we could not, we could not use uh a lower um internet package, you know, just, just because it is only going to be an emergency backup basis."" [Agent] ""And I am guessing you. Well, of course I mean you could. I just do not know if it would what it would really power you know unless we had a. Right, because you said you have a fair amount of devices they are going to be connected, right? So even as a backup, you know, if we go any lower, I would not hate to see you sacrifice the service what I would suggest there is a money back guarantee for XX days Try it out for a couple months. If you find out you do not use it, then it is probably best then you could downgrade."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I mean we really do not anticipate using it, but if, uh, it is more just for, you know, if an emergency happens like yesterday."" [Agent] ""Exactly, that is what I am saying you had that just yesterday, so."" [Customer] ""Alright, alright, uh, we, we can change the plan at any time."" [Agent] ""Exactly, there is no, no contracts. This price is good for X years as well."" [Customer] ""OK, alright, no problem.""

[Agent] ""The bill is $165 goes down to $160 with the auto pay, no contract right now we are putting in for the 6th of May, which is a Tuesday. XX to X is the window, about a half an hour before the tech's going to call XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Customer] ""Got you.""

OK, making sure that we are all on the same page. Alrighty then. So as far as the transfer service, um, the transfer, the installation is $100. That is going to get billed out to you. The money to to me or at the door. And the pricing structure is going to remain the same you actually you are going to get a much faster speed You are going to get a gig speed of service at this time. We no longer carry the um XXX speed that you were under. So basically we bump you up to the gig speed of service. It will be a X year promotion without any contracts or cancellation charges. This bundle is going to include, of course, your modem, your router, the phone number. Um, it is going to include your premier technical support, of course, and your fail over service. So just sit tight for me a couple of seconds and I will advise how quickly we can get somebody out there for you. If you need any assistance with networking past the demarcation point, you let us know. Trouble calls are included within our premier technical support on the bundles that we are creating. And as far as the services, the technician's going to go into the location. He is going to, um, run the wiring to wherever you need the modem installed regardless of what was there. It happens to be in the same spot, the same telecommunications closet no problem, all fine and dandy"" [Customer] ""Uh hold on one second, he is calling me back. X 2nd, yeah. Hello?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, right here."" [Customer] ""Yeah, OK. Oh, OK, yeah. He is getting it for me."" [Agent] ""Not a problem at all. OK, so as I was saying, the technician's going to run the line to where the modem needs to be installed, including the modem, the router your connection backup fell over service So with that, in case the main internet for any reason is ever done, it will switch over automatically to the LTE network, so you will be able to connect your X most important devices to that, be it a credit card terminal, be it a, um, your camera or or the the computer that um sets up the. Uh, the appointments because you know you want to go ahead and make sure that you can continue to function until we get out there and resolve the issues. So let us take a look here, um, tomorrow between the hours of X to XX or XX to X, what would be the time frame that you need?"" [Customer] ""Um, Uh, let me just make sure what is in here. One second. Uh, I was too."" [Agent] ""XXX OK perfect thank you."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so everything's just getting revamped once again, no contract, no cancellation charges. Keep services here for as long as you would like extending the promotion because you are a valued long time customer to a X year promotion. Um, you can make modifications at any time. You can add services, new services. This is all, um, part of our standard of care right now I am just going to go ahead and submit the work order Let me just go ahead and. Give you the new account number because when you move, the account number stays with the address as opposed to the customer so there is an account number that is registered to Suite X. So if you want to go ahead and take note of the account number, that would be great. Once you are installed, yep, once you are installed at the new location, please call technical support."" [Customer] ""Yes, sir, please."" [Agent] ""And you are going to ask them to create your new username and password for the new account number that way you will have full access to all your features on the web portal. I am going to go ahead and request that they transfer the same phone number if for any reason they are unable to because it is out of area, whatever the case may be, you know, they will go ahead and assign a new one. I do not think that'll be the case because you are staying within the same town and zip code, so we should be OK, um you are good to go So right now we are scheduling an appointment for 4:30 between the hours of the XX to X. This is going to be $100 for your installation, monthly rate remaining the same at the $210. Estimated taxes are $5.94. This is going to include your gig speed of service with your premier technical support at the $30 your connection failover service at the $30 your modem, your router no contracts and no cancellation charges Please note that the complete terms and conditions which contain binding arbitrary provisions are available at Asharian.com/optimum terms and will be sent to you via email. By enrolling, we are rid of these important details and conditions. Kindly confirm that you would like to enroll in the premier technical support, and I just need a verbal confirmation for that, please."" [Customer] ""Confirm."" [Agent] ""Perfect, thank you. Your access code is going to be. XXXX And the account number is XXX. XX X XXX X X-XX. So just to confirm, XXXXX-XXXXXX-XX."" [Customer] ""So"" [Agent] ""OK, I am just going to go ahead and note the account in the meantime, giving um Jack a few moments to get back to us with that tax ID I am setting up that pending disconnection for the old location You do not have to call to disconnect it or anything like that because this is a transfer service, so if you are OK with sticking around for just a few moments longer, giving him time to get back to you, I am OK with giving you a few more minutes if that is OK with you."" [Customer] ""Go on. Sure, yeah, sure."" [Agent] ""Thank you, yeah, just setting up the pending disconnection and I will take care of that. So once again, the equipment that you have at the old address, kindly just bring it over to the new one you would be good to go"" [Customer] ""So"" [Agent] ""May I ask what it is that your company is doing for cellular service, please? Which phone company do you have for cell phones?"" [Customer] ""Oh, we have Verizon."" [Agent] ""Yeah, Verizon, how many cell phones do you have on the business account, if you do not mind me asking?"" [Customer] ""Uh, about XX."" [Agent] ""Yeah XX. OK. Optimum can go ahead and provide up to XX phone numbers for our business services. Um, please know that our pricing with unlimited unlimited data, which would be unlimited talk, text, data with XX gigs of premium data, basically start at $45. And we can go ahead and provide you basically a phone for $7. The way that that works is basically you pay $45 for the, the the cell service You have about $2 in taxes, that is $47 you get $40 off on the internet service Let us say you just want to test our services out because we use T-Mobile towers. $7 tests out the service."" [Customer] ""Right, it is not T-Mobile is not, it is not, it is very good in my area."" [Agent] ""Really?"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Oh my goodness, I am so sorry to hear that because I mean the pricing structure."" [Customer] ""In the city, in the city. I know, I know, but in the city it is, it is better, but in my area, local area, it is a small town, it is not, not so good."" [Agent] ""You need to get them to put more towers up then, I guess."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, that is right."" [Agent] ""Alrighty then, so I mean just."" [Customer] ""If you could keep my number and and check, check up on it, but that is what my friends have been saying about the."" [Agent] ""No, I, I, I trust what what you are advising me. I am sorry that that is the case. Um, but once again, if it ever, you know, strikes your mind where you want to go ahead and maybe test it out, um, it is literally like $7 because you pay $47 for the unlimited line, but you get $40 off on the internet service."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So, you know, if that is a, if that is a way to go ahead and hopefully get some additional savings by all means, cause once you have just kind of like putting it out there um, once you have our Um, business services, give me just a couple of seconds. I just want to confirm because we have multi-product discounts, um, the $45 lines once you have X, once you have X lines goes down to $30 I think once you have X lines goes down to $25 Yep, $25 so $250 plus taxes, your bill for XX lines would be less than $300 basically because it would be about, it would be about $27.27 times XX, obviously $270 about $280 minus $40 you would be paying about $200 less than $250 overall because you know it would still be like the $280 on that but you get the $40 on the internet service, so definitely something to consider"" [Customer] ""Well, Mhm."" [Agent] ""Mhm mhm mm."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I have to uh Right now, like I said, I need the service that works, so right now T-Mobile seem to have the car, so unfortunately it is not an option."" [Agent] ""Understood. Understood. OK, so right now you are good to go on your installs, good to go on your disconnection. So at this point in time I just, um, were you able to get that tax ID by any chance?"" [Customer] ""Um, not yet."" [Agent] ""Alrighty then, so let me give you my email address. I do not want you to be too concerned because we will still be able to go ahead and do your installation."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Um, my email address is Sandra. Garcia. At Optimum.com. So S A N D R A G A R C I A at O P T I M U M dot com. OK, so when you have it, you could just go ahead and."" [Customer] ""Uh"" [Agent] ""Email me with the account number and say hey Sandra, the tax ID for how is that and I will go ahead and update it, you know, by the end of the day without any issues."" [Customer] ""No, I Is there an option to get like just one phone to get that down, or?"" [Agent] ""OK, your appointment is in the system for tomorrow between the hours of XX to X if you have any questions or concerns you want to go ahead and at least, you know, um, give the mobile service a try Um, you could always reach out to me via email I will be happy to be of assistance, OK Yeah, even with one line, you get that $40 discount. So that is why I first say, OK, it is $47 $40 discount on the internet service, your basic, your first line $7 Now if you had told me, oh I want two lines, I would say, OK, no problem, $60 for X $4 in taxes that is $64 minus $40 for the discount uh for having multi-product. I would say you can get two cell phones for less than $25. You tell me how many, how many you want, I will change my pitch right along with it."" [Customer] ""Right let me see, let me, let me, let, let me see what the Jack says I will get back to you"" [Agent] ""Yeah, not a problem. So you have my email sandra. Garcia@optimum.com.

It was truly a pleasure speaking to you and your appointment is good to go for tomorrow and then just bring the equipment over as I mentioned at the beginning of the call just to make it simpler for you that way you do not have to go to the payment center and return anything.""

Dash Enterprises. Dot com. You got it. Yeah, so that is contact at TSG-enterprises.com. Mhm. And that is the symbol dash too not the name dash Yeah, no, I, I got it. It is like uh A person uh that I was speaking to yesterday. She said that um somebody was telling her that her email. Uh I think I think she said dash oh period Does the person said that, you know, they they were spelling the word dash. What Or the work period something like that for the email. Yeah. I, I do not think that will work. Yeah OK, uh, pulling that up now here, uh, so. Sure, no problem. Sounds like you are driving. Yeah, there is Yeah, I am in I am in the car like multitasking uh. Of course. The EIN is XX. Uh huh OK. XXXX. OK. XXXX OK, just be careful, OK, you are driving, but just be careful. Oh no, I am parked right I am parked right I am parked right now yeah, I am, I am parked right now OK, good. Good yeah. So just to confirm that that is XXXXXXXXX. Yep. Mhm. Yep, you got it. Alright, and this is a gig market so. And services come with the phone. Uh, OK, so in your area. You said that you said the service comes with the phone. Yes, cancel the phone without on the number. Alright, uh, OK, so in your area we could do high speed internet, um, X gigs, X gigs, X gig, but if it is just going to be you and maybe a couple of employees, uh maybe X gig should be sufficient X gigs and X gigs, I think it will be overkill. Be too much. OK, OK. So XK will be perfect. Yeah, that Uh, and yeah, I mean, as you expand your business or get more employees, then you can always upgrade right now X gig is is more than enough OK, yeah, whatever you, whatever you think. You guys have BJs with Cosco over there, right? OK You do, of course they are all over. Uh You said you said we have what? BJ's or Costco? Oh yeah we got Costco, yeah. OK, so X gigs will be for like a taco. Oh yeah, hell no, no, we just need XX is good. Uh No, by the way, X gigs with the with the phone, uh, it is about $600 a month. Damn, that is crazy. Oh yeah, I mean, we do X gigs a lot. That is like XXX and change, almost XX gigs, but I, I never seen anybody with X gigs, not yet. I, I, and it is been out for like years maybe. So, so So the question, how much is this going to run this for just X gig because I, I only pay like $100 for my, my home service. Alright, residential, right, but residential commercial two totally different entities. Remember that residential is always going to be cheaper, always, no matter what. Uh-huh. But I will, I will tell you in a minute. Just do me a favor. Just give me a X digit access code for the account and a PIN, phone numbers you remember the time, a pin. XXXX. James Bond got you. Yeah I hope he lets it take it yeah, it did. Alright, cool bean. Alright, hold on, let us see. Yeah, well, yeah, XXXXXX digits, right? Yeah, mhm, yep, got it, absolutely, absolutely, just give me a moment because this thing sometimes um. OK. Sometimes it takes it, sometimes it does not. I do, I do have a question for you. Was that beeping on over there? Sure. That is me. I am sorry this is my, my, my, my, my phone for the Oh, OK, OK, no For one device that I have. I know you good. I just want to make sure nothing. I will make sure nothing in my truck was beeping. I am like what is this beeping, but uh OK uh quick question for you No, it is, it is, it is something like that, yeah, uh. Um, so I have, I have two phone services like I have this line that I am talking to now, and I got X other, I got two other business lines on the line that I on the package that I have for this phone, mobile phone, but two of the lines, not this line, but the other two lines are business lines like I literally use it for my business my both of my businesses got XX uh for each business. Uh-huh. OK. Right. My question would be, uh, is it a possible option to transfer, uh. My personal line or these lines that I have that I use for my business over to the business line. To the one that we are going to put on on this location. A business account? Yeah. OK, is it a local number? Is it the same area code or similar to Eureka? Or no? You got to think of that. Yeah, it is, it is, yeah it is it is the, it is the same service it is through Optimum Mobile. OK, so, alright, so you want to, uh, so it is an optimal move that you want to bring to a landline at the office. No, no, not a landline. I want to I want to have a, a, a cell phone line, but under the business name, yeah, but under the business line Uh, another cell phone. OK, OK, yeah, that is fine. And, right, no, that is fine, and, and the good thing is that if you do that, uh, they are going to give you a $40 discount on this account, um, uh, uh, $40 discount, yes, OK, which is great. OK. So that is, that is what ran and that is for transferring, right? I do not, I do not want to start a whole new one. I just want to transfer the line I already have for the business I just want to transfer under my under this business name Right, but OK, so, uh, let me get this straight because I do not want to tell you something is not there. Do you want to get a new cell phone with the same number that you have right now? Yes or no? No, no, no, no, I already, I already have a cell phone with you guys already yeah, I got, I got X cell phones OK. Right, right, without optimum. I got X cell phones, yeah, with Optum, yep, I have X cell phones, right, but X of them, X of them I own, I use for business. Cool, cool right now. So I am wondering instead of it being in my personal name and I am paying like on the personal account, can I just bring those lines over to this account that I am setting up with you guys with the internet and just have the business lines. Right. You, you, right, OK, you, that is fine, but the only thing is that if in order for you to do that, you would need to get, um, to bring the numbers over. Um, I will find out in a minute. Yeah. Give me a second because I, I never have done that, um. OK. Yeah, because this is going to be a landline with the internet, um, but if you want to bring those cell phones, the, the, the bottom line is you want to change those cell phones from your personal name to a business account, to a business name, period. Mhm. Yes, yes, correct, yes, correct. Right, so yeah, right, so that might be a change of name, but I do not know who would do that. I am going to ask, I, I am going to ask, I have a team that handles our cell phones. I am going to ask them right now. Hold on. OK. Mm. Hold on, let me see. Where's the telephone? What Oh, OK. Let me, OK, uh, how Uh, say hi for us. I am sorry that I am keeping you. All good, all good, as long as we get this set up the right way and get it going, that is that is the main thing. And And you said X lines, right? You have X phone numbers in your name? Yes. And they are all, they all optimum, all three of them. Yep, all three of them are optimal, yep, they are on a package together. They all are on the, uh, account together. Shut up. OK, let us say what they say right. Meanwhile, let us continue. hold on a moment. Alright no IP address.

Alright, give me one moment, I will be right back, OK, it is giving me an error. Hold on one second, OK? Alright Great. Um, first available appointment I have. Excuse me, unfortunately it is only May 1st. I was asking someone else and they said that unfortunately they do not have a quota for the area, so May 1st will be the first available, which is this Thursday, X days, X days from now. OK. Uh, X to XX in the morning, is that OK with you? OK. What what is what is the time? X to XX in the morning. X to XX, yeah, that'll. Yeah, oK, just make sure you have someone there, you know, by XX, um, and what number do you want me to have them call before arriving? Yeah. What number? Uh, my personal line. OK, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, yeah, XX XXX. XXX, XXX-XXXX. Yeah, I lost you for a minute. Yeah, correct. XXXXXX. XXXX. It is cell phone. Mr. Green. OK. Alright sir, so we are going to go out there then May 1st between X and XX. We will set up high speed internet XGB to mode on the router. This also comes with basic protection plan with something goes wrong with it to fix it for free for a value of $30 which is part of the service with a battery backup just in case the network goes down, the battery backup will kick in and one phone number unlimited calling all together it is going to be only XXX. And the is going to be free as a one time courtesy installation charge and also you are going to get a $200 Visa gift card after XX days of service as long as you do not disconnect the phone, I mean that you do not downgrade the internet disconnect the account or fall behind the new payments, you will get those $200. You got it. OK, yeah, I got, and I have, I have another question here, so all of that sounds great, so you said it comes with a line. Alright. Sure. What what does that mean? That means that you have dial to and phone number. It comes with a landline. Yes, that means you have dial to and phone number. You could connect uh a fax machine. You can connect a regular landline, a regular phone, uh, you can use it as a private line so they do not bother you and things like that. Mhm. Or you can phone calls from your main office to that number if in case no one is at the main office so you can pick up the phone and answer those calls. Right. Uh, again you can use a fax machine and everything else. Uh-huh. It is a regular landline. And the good thing is there is unlimited calling in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Alaska, Hawaii, the Virgin Islands, unlimited. OK, and then I can set up, uh, so I have a a uh a X-XXX number if I wanted to forward the X-XXX number to that phone, that would, that would be good, huh? You can do that too, yep, mhm, yep, so this office, whoever calls the toll free, they will reach you. OK, I can do that. OK, yeah, yeah, OK. Alright Right, right, OK, alright, um, so that all of that sounds great. Let us lock it in and then I will pay in XX days. You send me a bill, OK, oh that is great, um. Yeah, you are going to get a bill, uh-huh, mhm. OK, so that now we got that squared away that is awesome that is perfect that is exactly what I needed, uh, let us lock and load with that and then the second thing that I was trying to figure out is, OK, so I am paying for my cell phones, uh, all together for the three lines I am paying I think $100 I think it is like $110 or something like that. OK. If we were, did you get the answer about switching over those lines? Yes, yes, yes, yes, and unfortunately they say at this time you can not. OK. OK, so in order for me to do that I will have to start a whole new service Yeah, X new X new phone numbers, X new phone numbers. With the business line in order to get the business line. Oh, and then I have to change the phone numbers too. Well yeah, so right, right, because they at this time they can not, they can not pull the numbers from. I guess up to to according to what she said um hold on one second, let me read to you what she said exactly. Uh, uh, these are the people that handles the phone with us because I asked, I said Hi, good day I have a question. So has X cell phone numbers with Optimum as a package deal, so we like to convert them to business instead. we could just change the name for his personal name to a business name she answered, uh, personal phones with Optimum accounts can not be converted to business at this time The customer will have to open uh an entirely new business to business account using his business tax ID. And the existing up to mobile numbers will not be eligible to be converted over to that new account. Then I said, uh, can we keep the same numbers on each phone? Dang. She said no. I said, OK, um. OK. And then she said if he wants to have a business account, yes, he will have to uh he would be new numbers because we can not convert uh residential numbers to business number at this time. And I said OK great thanks. OK, is there any Is there any pricing on that? Uh huh. Is it what what is the pricing on your business lines? Uh. Sure, I will give you that right now. Uh remember with business also you will get that $40 discount remember on on this account. Uh-huh. So instead of XXX it would be XXX. Right, right. Uh, give me a moment. Where's my thing for the phones? But I am not, I am not, yeah, and I am the main thing I am concerned about is that I have business cards printed with that with that number in already, so like. Mm Oh, OK. And then you know, so it is just like and I have that number for a few different accounts and stuff so it is like I was trying to keep that number because I am already doing business with that number and um. Right. Right, right. Yeah, so it just it does not make a lot of sense for me to. To switch that over if I can not get the number. Well, So let, let us say you want to go, who, if you do not mind me asking, who has the numbers, the cell phones, employees or family members or all I am sure you do not carry all three in your pocket, but anyway. No, no, no, no, I keep one at the office which I use for customer for my clients that they can text or, you know, new, new, uh, prospects for them to text, and, uh, the other one is the other one is for my food business, so it is a completely different business and that stays with the bus with the business equipment and stuff and when when the employees use that. Right, and the other two. Right. OK, oK, OK, OK. Right. Um, and, and yeah, so. Yeah, and, and all of those numbers are already like the 3rd X is my personal line. And the 3rd X? OK, alright, well, the reason I ask you is because we have different in business we have different packages of phones. OK, uh, some of them have high speed internet and some of them have lower speed internet. OK, is the, the amount of internet they can use. For example, we have the unlimited max, which is $55 a month, OK, but that one has, um, uh, let me read it to you, that one has, uh, XX gigabytes of premium data. Mhm. That is a lot of data, a lot, XX gigabytes, man. XG access included XG network, unlimited talk and text and XX gigabytes of mobile hotspot, which is still a lot too. And uh HD video streaming, that is $55 a month, but if we do X lines, it goes down to $40 a month instead of being $150 you would pay $120. You see what I mean? Mm, right, so I am so it is like the same price that I am paying right now. OK. So yes, I would, I would, I would be on board right now to to hop on if it was not for the for the numbers that is the thing that is kind of holding me up because I am like, yeah because it is like I have to keep changing the numbers everywhere and then people uh think that that is the number and they try to call and it is like, you know what I mean so it is just. The numbers, yeah, I, I, I know. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, I get it. I am not trying to confuse people or like block block any block any sales from coming in. No, no, of course. Yeah, of course, of course. Yeah. I mean, I wish you would have called us before you did that, but um. The the other thing I can think of is uh convert us to a landline and then come to Optim. I am, I am sorry say again That I said the only thing I can think of is convert those to a landline and then bring them to a cell phone. But that is going to take a. Convert them to a landline and then bring them to a to a cell phone? Yeah. Convert them to back to cell phone without them. You could do that? You can, you can convert cell phones to landlines, of course, absolutely. So, so if I convert it when my line to a, a landline and then I will be able to convert it back to a business line of a cell phone? So basically a cell phone, yeah, after, yeah, after you convert it to a landline. Is that what you are saying? But that means that you have to pay an installation to. You know, install them at the office or whatever you want install. Yeah, so it will be like a process. Yes, it will be a bit lengthy, like maybe a month or less. And then I have to pay extra money to. Uh, but you, but it can be done, it is not a problem. So what Well, what about this landline that I am getting now? Could I convert the number the number that I already have on the cell phone to the landline that I am getting already? Is there a is there is there is there a local number here? It is a yeah it is a local number here, yeah, it is XXX number. OK, so if, if you want me, if you want me to take it over, I, I do not, I can not, sure, I just got to send you what is called an LOA, a letter authorization, so you can fill it out and send it back to us so we can convert the number from a cell phone to a landline. OK, and then let me ask you a question, once I switch it over to a landline. From the cell phone I can now switch that that landline over to a business line? Cell phone? Oh, you talking about, you talk about converting it again? Yeah, and a cell back into the cell phone but for business. Uh, I believe so. Could, could you confirm that for me? Hold on, yeah, that is what, that is all, yeah. If you, if you can convert uh. OK. Why, why you do that? I am just going to grab some coffee. Take, take your time. Go ahead, take it, take care, take care. Uh Yep. All right bye. OK, they are going to let me know because she is not sure yet. So we will just leave the appointment, you know for that day and then um I will I will come back to you with that answer OK. I will call you back, um, and then maybe we can figure, maybe we can figure out how we can move those three numbers and convert them to business. OK, oK. OK, yeah, that sounds, that sounds good, that sounds good. Yeah, uh, so Right, mhm, yeah, and then, uh. We will just rock with what we already have and then, uh, yeah. Hold on a moment. And uh she is going to she is going to send me a message back. Uh, but right now she does not have the answer. OK. She said she is going to. So I will follow up with you shortly via the the end so.

[Agent] ""No, I, I like the ARK from your last name. It is nice. Alrighty then, um. So as far as the services are concerned, we can provide you TV service, internet service, phone service. You are going to have a healthy office, X people, that is a good amount. Talk to me about what you are going to be doing. I mean, besides trading, like, you know, basically, um, does everybody have a computer out there does that they are going to be working off of?"" [Customer] ""No, so only X people are X, only X people are going to be using the computer constantly."" [Agent] ""Did you? Mhm."" [Customer] ""I am sure other people are going to join the Wi Fi, but yeah, that is really what it is, and um, yeah, that is been more or less it is really, it is pretty simple, and I am only going to need internet services today."" [Agent] ""OK. OK, so Understood the way that our promotions work, it gives you a deeper discount, um, with double and triple play promotions. So if you are adding TV service kind of situation gives you a deeper discount, same thing with the dial tone. Did you need TV service for like a break room or waiting area, anything like that?"" [Customer] ""No, no, no, not really, not really."" [Agent] ""OK, not a problem. So we will go ahead and skip that. Um, it will go ahead and give you a dial tone so it gives you a deeper discount on the Internet service to help offset the phone number pricing structure. Now as far as the service, can you tell me please how long your lease is for this location?"" [Customer] ""It is for X years."" [Agent] ""Perfect, thank you so much. Now Optimum does not have any contracts or cancellation charges as far as the services are concerned. I am going to go ahead and give you a promotion for a X year promotion. Um, if you decide you hit the lotto you want to retire, you want to go ahead and disconnect services, not an issue at all Feel free to do so, return the equipment, no problem, no harm, no foul, but at least it gives you the promotion for, you know, for the long term that you are there. And also let us say you decide to extend your stay once the promotion ends you could always reach out to our coordinators and we will be able to go ahead and provide you pricing on that. OK, so let us go ahead and take a look. Mhm I am just adding codes here with all the necessary discounts right so. Just make sure this works out. OK perfect thank you. So as far as our services are concerned with their gig speed of service, keeping in mind the amount of devices that you are going to go ahead and um have at the location, it makes sense to do the gig. That is basically the industry standard nowadays so you will have potentially X people to people, you know, um, on the computers, everybody, you know, has their cell phone maybe a wireless printer, that kind of thing OK, so anywhere between about X to XX devices under normal circumstances is what the location will have as far as internet, uh, the installation would be $100 then the monthly rate Including your modem, your router, from your technical support, your connection failover service, and one phone number so that you can use it as a backup, as a fax number, and alarm, whatever the case may be."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""That is going to go ahead and be $180. Um, the taxes on this estimated $5."" [Customer] ""$180?"" [Agent] ""That would be with the gig speed of service, your modem, your router, and that is a X year promo on the service, so that locks in your price."" [Customer] ""Oh, that is expensive. That is more than I thought I was going to pay. I thought I was going to pay around like $80.90 dollars. That is, that is what my friend told me. That is how much you pay."" [Agent] ""I can definitely go ahead. I mean, as far as the services are concerned, um, you know, maybe your friend was considering his home when he was saying, oh, this is maybe what the pricing structure may go ahead and be, um, I, as much as I would love to go ahead and potentially match our residential rates, it is not something that I can go ahead and do if you would like for me to."" [Customer] ""Alright. What is the cheapest, what is the cheapest rate you can give me?"" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Like in general."" [Agent] ""Well, let us, let us go ahead and discuss that because the least expensive or the most cost effective way is not necessarily the, the, the slowest speed for the internet service. Because if I was to give you, let us say our most basic speed, it would only be a year promotion and you would end up paying more money at the regular price for the other X years on the pricing structure that I am giving you. So if cost is definitely something that we need to be mindful of, what I can go ahead do is that I can go ahead and bring this to a X year promotion as opposed to a X year promotion And do you feel like you would get use out of your phone number? I keep in mind that the price structure is minimal I want to go ahead and make sure that if you can"" [Customer] ""I do not need no I do not need a phone number I really do not need a phone number. That is not much of a business."" [Agent] ""Not a problem."" [Customer] ""That is all we do."" [Agent] ""That, that is not an issue at all. I want to go ahead and make sure that I offer you something that you are going to go ahead and get good usage out of, OK, so just to check for me a couple of seconds. Let me modify it. I will go ahead and provide you a X year promotion as opposed to the X year promo and then bring that down without the um the phone number. So just to take for me a couple of seconds. I appreciate your patience while I make those quick modifications here. OK, so at this time, um, if I go ahead and move that to the X year, move it without the phone service, everything else remaining the same, of course, your modem router, your gig speed of service, um, with the modem router, the premier technical support, the pricing structure for the service, just a second, making sure I am not missing any codes here. Appreciate your patience. Give me about a minute more. Almost done. OK, perfect. I was able to go ahead and bring that down to XXX. So taking off the phone service, making."" [Customer] ""Can, is there any way you could get a $100?"" [Agent] ""I am sorry can you repeat"" [Customer] ""Is there any option that we can make it, that we could do to make it under $100?"" [Agent] ""Under $100. Let me go ahead and take a look because I do not want you to have to sacrifice on the speed and then have to call in and say the internet is too slow and then have to pay for additional services. Let me go ahead and bring in my supervisor just to see if there is anything else that I could go ahead and do."" [Customer] ""I"" [Agent] ""If you could just sit tight for me a couple of seconds, I would greatly appreciate it. Just going to go ahead and let him know kind of like why I am asking for any particular concessions letting him know that you had a particular idea on what the pricing structure might have been based on what your friend had advised you see if there is anything else that he can go ahead and do because with the size of the location, um, it would still be."" [Customer] ""Sure."" [Agent] ""Um, the best to do the gig speed of service, but just to take me a few moments. I appreciate your patience. Now, how do you feel about autopay and paperless?"" [Customer] ""Uh, paperless is fine. Autopay is fine too. I, I can set up auto pay autopay."" [Agent] ""OK. So basically when I could go ahead and do aside from whatever my supervisor may potentially approve um we will go ahead and include a $5 discount for autopay and paperless when you sign up for it. So that is going to go ahead and help because I mean every load of it counts, you know, getting us to that, that point, that is, you know, that is where we need to be."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""Just sit take me a couple of seconds longer. He is sending me a code to use now I just have to make sure that it works. With The services."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""OK. OK, so as long as we can go ahead and get you up and running and installed by tomorrow, um, if that is in your calendar that it fits my supervisor will be able to do something because basically it is like it will count for April numbers if that means anything to you, so he is willing to go ahead and credit your installation."" [Customer] ""Uh"" [Agent] ""The price would go down to XXXXX. We would be able to install you tomorrow between the hours of either X to XX or XX to X."" [Customer] ""Uh, XX to X is a lot better, but yes, that works for me."" [Agent] ""OK, perfect. So that is going to include the modem, the router, your premier technical support. So if you need any assistance with networking pass to the vitation point. You let us know. Trouble calls are included within your Premier technical support and the bundles that we are creating. So for any reason something's not working, we can send the technician out there no charge to you As far as the services are concerned, the technician's going to go. He is going to install your modem, your router, and your connection fail over service so that if for any reason the main internet is down, it will switch over to the LTE towers and it will be using um the failover service on your most critical devices up to X devices, and that will give us time to go ahead and"" [Customer] ""Is"" [Agent] ""Resolve the situation on your main internet service so that is all part of the bundle that he was able to go ahead and do. OK.com. Perfect. I need a X digit access code for your account, please. What X digits would you like to do?"" [Customer] ""Uh, we could do XXXX."" [Agent] ""OK, XXX-X.

See Well, right now we will work on removing cellulite and finding your stomach and making your butt look bigger if that is what you want or getting rid of your bat wings or your back fat or your chin fat. There is no judgment here. Mm mm mmm. And I might have to keep your information. Because I check about X of those boxes. Plenty of skin tightening. Yeah, non-invasive. Interesting, interesting. Yeah. I may have to, to look your, your Instagram up and read up on it a little bit more. Um. I just opened it, yeah, like it is, it is all like I am still in school for the massage therapy part my Instagram looks like crap Mhm. My sister's going to help me put it together because it sucks. I am like, I really, I do not know how to do this part. I know how to do all the technical stuff that I am trying to put out there. Well there you go. So you take care of the, of the, of keeping your clients safe, keeping your clients comfortable, and let your sister take care of the technology part of it. They had a they had a queas in car so my problem. And then a year and there is other. When are you, when are you when are you opening up if you do not mind me asking. Tomorrow. Um, in the next week, I, I can do that other, that part, and then in a year, I am going to have a massage therapist in the office until I can do it until I get my license. Mhm. OK. And even then we will have two of us, and most likely one of my classmates, so we will have X massage therapists there. Beautiful. Nice. Well, here is to you and your goals. May they come to fruition. Thank you. Congratulations, um. Exciting. Thank you. OK, let me that so. No, all I need is Wi Fi so I can play the music while I am working. I hear you that you need that Spotify. You need to go ahead and make sure you have your cameras to keep everybody orderly. Mhm. You need to have your credit card terminal going. That is fine. The what? I got you. I got you I got you. OK, so let me ask you a question just so I know what I am putting together for you so I can make sure that we are putting the best, um, foot forward, the best promos together kind of situation. It is No TV. Um, we can provide TV service, internet service, phone service, all of the above. Now, as far as the service are you going to have a TV in maybe like the waiting area or anything like that, maybe news or something like that playing in the movie? I, I just mean. I just really need Wi Fi, but I still, I, I do not know if the bundle of X that I saw online that you can get like phone and email for. Something that is not really expensive. Phone and internet. Yeah, that one, sorry. OK, no, no, no, it is OK, it is OK, just making sure that you know it is the internet service because we do not provide emails, but we do provide the internet service through which you can receive through which you can receive your emails so you know, I, I, I literally just have to go ahead and make sure I say it correctly because it is one of those things I do not want to mislead the customer into just, you know. Yeah, that is what I meant, that is not. Mm. That kind of thing, um, OK, ma'am, that is all, um, what I am going to do is I am going to go ahead and price it out to you, including the internet service, of course your dial tone so that you have, um, the best promotions possible because it does include a phone number where it gives you a deeper discount on the internet service to help us set the pricing structure of the phone. OK. It will include your modem, your router, and it will also include your premier technical support so that if you need any assistance with networking any of your devices, you do not have to worry. Yeah. You can call us, we will be happy to help you network them over the phone and it will also include um any trouble calls that you may have. We will not. You will not get charged for trouble calls to send a technician out to your location. That is very important when you have a small business you are trying to go ahead and make, you know, the most out of your money and your investment OK Oh Yeah, yeah. So let me go ahead and work on the rest of this so that I can go ahead and price it out accordingly we will see when we can send somebody out there Um, do you already have a, do you already have electricity at the location? OK perfect. I have been there X years. Um, well, OK. Yeah, I am switching careers. OK. Mm. Yeah, like just like. OK, just bear with me a few here. And Make sure I am not missing any codes. OK, so the system is giving us a X year promotion at this time. Again, no contract, no cancellation charges. So whenever you want to go ahead and disconnect, you just return your equipment and you are so it. The installation is a one time charge of $100 and that gets billed out to you. The pricing structure, as I mentioned is going to include that phone number, that modem, the router, the premier technical support, your connection failover service. So if for any reason, um, there is an issue with the main internet service, it will automatically switch over to the failover service so you can continue to book your appointments. You have your main computer, your cameras, you can connect it to the uh primary X devices on that fail over service to the LTE network until we get out there and fix the main issue now. Normally, um, we would go ahead and have a package like for the gig speed of service and everything with what I am offering you. The package would normally be $240 but right now with the fact that we are doing the. Gig speed of service at the XXX speed price and we are including a $30 multi multi-product discount. The monthly rate would be $160 that once again is a X year promotion without any contracts or cancellation charges So giving you your normal discounts plus your gig speed of service at the XXX speed and your $30 in multi-product discounts, it would be $160 I can let you know in just a few moments how quickly I can get somebody out there Let me know how that sounds to you. There is a lower speed though, right? That is a little bit more economical because I am really just going to have a Lea plane. OK, so there is, there is a lower speed because right now we are giving the gig speed of service at the XXX speed price, the price difference between getting the gig speed of service and the XXX speed, the difference is $10 That you do not have So I can go ahead and bring it down to half the speed, like X gig is XXXX megs, XXX megs versus XX. What, what is it without, without the phone then cause I do not, I do not really want to spend that much. Um, it would be $15 difference, um, because normally the phone is $40 right now you are getting it for $25 you are getting a $10 multi-product discount So if you want me to take it off I can and that removes $15 from your account. As a heads up, if you want to do autopay and paperless, that also gives you an additional $5 discount for autopay and paperless. Mm. So what is the, what would be the number on that? So if I was to go ahead and take off the phone, that would go ahead and bring your XXX down by XX to XXX then you can also set up without the phone Use the phone does not make a difference. Yeah, I mean, because we are giving such deep discounts, it is like the price differences like we are talking about $10.15 dollars or more then you could also add an additional $5 discount for auto pay and paperless if you wanted to do, um, if you wanted to sign up for autopay and paperless after OK. OK. Can you tell me, am I, am I keeping the phone? Am I taking it off? Yeah, yeah, they, yeah, so what what you originally said $15 is not going to make or break I would rather not have people calling me I. OK. That is a very good way of separating church and state, um absolutely, cause, you know sometimes you just want to be able to mindlessly scroll through Instagram You want to be able to just relax in the, you know, pin the recipes that we are never going to cook, you know, do all of that fun stuff, all the meals that we are going to do at brunch that all your friends forget. I know I sound a little affected by that, but that is fine. So the technician is going to call this XXX-XXX-XXXX. Before they get there to confirm that they are on their way. Mhm. I can give you Friday between the hours of X to XX or XX to X. OK. Mhm Um, X to XX. OK, so that means it can show up at any time between the hours of X to XX to begin working. Is that OK with you? That, yeah, that is fine. OK, perfect. So we are going to do that X to XX. I am going to need a X digit access code for your account. What four digits would you like to use? XXXX. XXXX. X, that is my sister's birthday. Oh XXXX. Oh Exactly, yeah. She is a tax baby. Yeah, text them. Yup, yup, yup. She was actually born on Easter Sunday, so it is always one of those floating kind of days. So she was born on tax day and Easter Sunday, so, you know, good stuff. Um, let us take a look. I am going to go ahead and recap the order with you. I am going to give you your complete account number and I will give you the phone number the technical support so that you can give them a ring to make sure that you get your, uh, web portal up and going. Let me know if you have um a pen and paper handy if you want to open up your notes app. I do. Beautiful. Yeah, I got pen and paper. Perfect. Perfect. Do you choose the phone number now? The system generates the phone number. Does it generate that Right. The system generates the phone number, and it is given to you on the date of installation once it is approved by XXX service. Please keep in mind that the business that the system knows that it is for a business, so it tries to pull user friendly numbers, repeating digits, that kind of thing. Mm. So we take that very much into consideration. OK. So we try to do that as much as we can. Alright then, so right now I am scheduling an appointment for you. OK, sounds good. Uh, for May 2nd between the hours of X to XX over at XXX City Island Avenue, Suite X, Bronx, New York, your installation will be billed out $100. Your monthly reoccurring charges are $160. Your estimated tax is $8.01. This is going to be for your gig speed of service with your premier technical support at the XX. You have your modem, your router your connection failover service at your XX You have your phone number. You have your multi-product discounts you have a X year promotion without any contracts or cancellation charges Please know that the complete terms and conditions which contain binding arbitrary provisions are available at harian.com/optimum terms and will be sent to you via email. By enrolling, you agree to these important details and the terms and conditions, um, please confirm that you would like to enroll in the premier technical support, and I just need a verbal confirmation for that. Yes, please. Thank you. I have your access code as XXXX I have your account number as XXX XX. Dash XX XX XX. XX. OK, so just to reiterate, XXXXX-XXXXXX-XX and send the technician out there prepared to do a full installation for you. Got it. Um, this is a new account. I mean the the location is serviceable. I am sending them out there to do a fiber check to ensure that the wiring is the way that it says that it should be. Um, if for any reason they see additional work needs to be done, they will go ahead and advise and reschedule the appointment. But for now, um, we should be good to go on the service as far as the, um, checks are concerned, um, meaning the checks at the pole for the location. Got it. The phone number to technical support is XXX-XXX-XXXX. OK. And you are going to give them a call after you are installed, and they will help you create your online web portal, OK, that is so that you have access to the account online, you are able to set up your features, your voicemail, you are able to go ahead and, um, listen, you know, just make sure you have all your ducks in a row in that level of service. Now can I ask you please what is it that you are doing for your cellular service? Go it. What do you currently have as your carrier? I, I have. T-Mobile, I have X lines. OK, that works. So Optimum uses T-Mobile as their towers for our cellular service with Optimum Mobile. I can go ahead and make this a really simple pitch. I am going to go ahead and just give you the following numbers. So right now we are at XXX. If you were to add one phone number with Optimum. It would be $47 for an unlimited line with unlimited talk, text, data with XX gigs of premium data. That makes your monthly rate $207 you get $40 off on your internet service when you go ahead and have cellular service with an unlimited line with us So that makes it $167 and that is including the taxes on your cellular service. So basically, $7 more and you got a business cell phone. If you have X lines and this is Why is it so cheap? Because there is no contract with Optimum Mobile. What is the catch? They use T-Mobile towers so you are familiar with the service The catch, I would not call it a catch, is the fact that it is our own product. Mhm. So we are taking a hit on the internet pricing structure because we want you to try out our cellular service, and this is not a temporary, um, you know, a discount or anything like that. You have a cellular service with an unlimited line. You have our gig speed of service. You get an extra $40 off on the internet service. That is literally what it is. Now you have X lines. So for XXX. So basically, yeah, because it is $160. Yeah. You the the taxes on this account I had told you was $8 at $47 for your cellular service on one line that is $215 actually because I want to make sure since I am adding the taxes on the cell phone that I also add the taxes on the internet. It is $215 minus $40 you are still at $175. You are literally at XXX. Now let us take this a little bit further. Do you know how much you are paying for your X lines? Monthly? XXX. Once you have X lines or more, I am sorry X lines or more with optimum because we can do up to. XX lines. Once you have X lines or more, those $45 lines come down to $25. So you are literally at XX times X. That is XX. What is the catch? There is no account again, that is the price. That is our multi-product discount. That is literally our multi-line savings. That $45 line goes down to, if you only, let us say you have two lines, it goes down to $30 and if you have X lines or more, then it goes down to $25. So it is literally XX times X. That is $125. The taxes on X lines. Let us say it is $15. It is usually about $2 and change. Let us exaggerate a little. Let us say that it is $15. That right there is going to be $25 plus the $2 in taxes. That is $27 times X. That is about $135. Let us say XXX minus the $40 that you get on the internet service. Literally, if you are paying $300 and change, now my question is, are you paying off phones within that money? Um, my daughter, I just got her a new phone. So remember I am talking about just strictly the cell phone service. Um, I am not talking about, you know, the actual phones or anything like that. I want to make sure that we are on the same page because if we are talking apples to apples, just the, just the calling, the data, that kind of thing. That is what I am offering. I am offering you unlimited talk, text, unlimited data with XX gigs of premium data. If you are in a location where you consistently have Wi Fi, you turn the Wi Fi on so you are using your data while you are out and about But when you are in the office, your data is on, so you are good to go. Is that to be true. Um I literally you can literally go on our website right now Optimum Mobile you will see the pricing structure going up But then I have to pay for phones, right? No, you can you can bring your phones over It is called bring your own device. You read to me the IMEI numbers I am able to go ahead and um confirm that the phone numbers are compatible with our I am sorry, that the physical phones are compatible with ours I mean, if you have anything above an iPhone, I think it is like X or so, it is compatible with us, so we send you a SIM card. If you have, uh, you know, a device that has an eSIM then we just send you a new SIM. The activation for each phone. It is $20 plus the taxes maybe about $20.50 That is what it would be due on the time of activation. So My niece is on my account she has an iPhone X. Mm, I do not think a X would work. I think it has to be an X or above to tell you. I, I would check the IMEI number and it would tell me that it is if it is compatible or not. We can start this off with just one phone you get that extra $40 off and basically the phone would be literally, basically about $7 Mm. Yeah. Do today for a cell phone would be $20 and change for the SIM. And the activation, we keep the same phone number that you have or if you want to open up a new phone number for your business, I can do that as well. Just in case you will be able to text your customers. So I could transfer over just my line and leave the other line. You could start it out with just one. You could try it out with just one. At this time, yes. Mm. Again, I am taking it as a, as a step at a time. We can do all X we can do X we can do XX Once you have an Optimum mobile account, you can add to the account on the web portal as you go. Um, Usually, it is a lot easier when customers already have T-Mobile, because they are familiar with how the service works in their area because you are not going to be changing towers. Sometimes, you know, customers are a little bit more skeptical, like, oh, I have AT&T or I have this , you know, oh, I am upstate New York I am in the country , you know No, this is Magenta. Can I, can, can we, can we, can we discuss this on Friday while they are installing, or does it have to be like the second because it is a lot of information there. You do You would not be discussing with the technician because the technician would be there to install. Yeah, uh, No, with you, not him. He is just doing what he does. You can go ahead and discuss it with me at your convenience. I can definitely understand the the, you know, the, the excess of information OK. Let me give you my email address. That way when you feel comfortable, you can email me and say, OK, Sandra, I have a few moments to talk reiterate to me what it was that we spoke about I will be happy to do so OK. Yeah, I just want to go, I want to look at my bill because then I will just transfer my phone because I use it for work anyway and then see how that goes. Yeah, and then you can go ahead and add additional. Um, because I am pretty sure it paid off right now. Yeah, OK. Let me know when, let me know when you are ready. What is the email address? OK, I am going to say it, then I am going to spell it, and then I am going to say it again, OK? I am ready. Let me know if you, so email address is Sandra. OK. Mhm. I am ready. So it is Sandra. Garcia at optimum.com. So that is S A N D R A G A R. CIA At I am sorry, at OPTIMUM.com, so Sandra. Garcia at optimum.com I just want to confirm that your phone number is XXX-XXX-XXXX, is that correct Yeah. OK perfect thank you. With your permission, I am going to go ahead and just send you a quick little flyer that we have including the account number just so that I know which account to match it up to when you do decide to move forward with it, you can feel comfortable to just reply back and say, hey Sandra, I am ready to talk about this. Call me back. Let me know if you received it because I also want to make sure that I filled your email correctly you know that we are not missing anything OK. Just waiting for my laptop to stop sleeping. I heard it beeps. Inform me. Yes, I have it. OK, so you have Sandler. Um, Oh, sounds good, yeah. You have this letter just says optimum contact and it has a little flyer regarding our Optimum mobile service so you can just review that and feel comfortable whenever you are ready. You just email me with your phone number. I am a commission based sales representative, so I would truly appreciate it if you do want to move forward just email me I will be happy to assist, OK Yeah, alrighty then. I thank you so much for the opportunity to be of further assistance to you. OK, thank you. Um, I am ready when you are and hopefully we will have a successful installation on Friday, and that is pretty much all there is doing, Miss Sharon. Any other questions or concerns that I can address for you before you let me go? No, that was it. You were very easy. Thank you. I appreciate it. Um, I congratulate you on your new career path. I hope it is a very, very successful one, and, um, actually, well, do keep on doing what you are doing, make women smile, even if it hurts a little while you are doing it, you make a smile after. Just a little bit, little bit, yeah. Oh poquito poquito, but I thank you so much for your time. Please be safe. Have a wonderful day and thank you for choosing Optimum. Thank you for being the best part of us. You too. Take care. Bye bye. Thank you."""

For example, what is going to happen with the number, their number? What do you mean if if if you get a new account? Right. That number is just turned off for I think like X months so you can never get that number under your name. You can not get it in X months. You can not get any year you can not get it. Right, but what is going to happen with the number because if they want to reuse it later. If they want to reuse it later, they can reuse it later. OK. Um, they have X months to reactivate the number if if for instance the old business owner moves to a new location or whatever, they can reactivate that number within X months. And after X months, uh, it is either X months or X months. I am not sure. He said X months or X and after that it is lost. OK. What is that you buying in you, you are buying a you are taking over you are buying a business from somebody else Yeah. Right, you can, yeah, so yeah, that is always the, the question if you want to keep the same telephone number, you just take over the form. Everything stays the same.

Um, I did not want them to lose the number because, uh, that was a concern for them. They already have another business and they have a new number. Um, I do not. Well, it is up to them because they they own that number for up to X months. Mhm. So if they call, uh, you know, if they call us and say hi I um. I want to reactivate that number. You, you know, we can activate the number in a new location. Um, as long as they do not move far, you know, it is where, where is the business now? What city? Bridgeport, Connecticut.

[Customer] ""XXX."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""XXX"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""XXX X."" [Agent] ""You have a tax ID for garden restoration."" [Customer] ""I am driving. I, I do not have it on me, but I. I will have it"" [Agent] ""OK, we, we could update that on the back end. What is your email address?"" [Customer] ""Fred F R E D."" [Agent] ""Uh-huh."" [Customer] ""At Spartan Resto R E S T O dot com."" [Agent] ""FedEx Spartanresto.com."" [Customer] ""Yes sir."" [Agent] ""Alright, you are looking for the one gig service? When you say extended, are you looking for pro Wi Fi? Because they do not have, we do not have like you know, Wi Fi extended We do offer something called pro Wi Fi. What kind of business is this? What are you connecting?"" [Customer] ""Um, they will probably be X or X. People in the office there will be some television. At times there could be up to XX people. So I think maybe that was what it was pro Wi Fi that."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Did that have the extender in it?"" [Agent] ""Yes, it comes for Wi Fi comes with a with with a with it does come with a. Extender or access point, so to speak it is called an access point."" [Customer] ""OK, yes, yep."" [Agent] ""OK, bear me one second. I am going to put a package together for you. I will go, I will bring up the pricing we will, I will tell you what the scheduling looks like Hold on one moment, OK?"" [Customer] ""Thank you."" [Agent] ""You are welcome. If this calls are dropped, can I reach you back at the XXXXX-XXX-XXX-XXXX?"" [Customer] ""Yes, absolutely."" [Agent] ""Alright, alright, hold on one moment."" [Customer] ""Thank you."" [Agent] ""Thank you so much. Are you there, Mr. uh Mr. Cataldo?"" [Customer] ""Yes sir, I am."" [Agent] ""Alright, so I was actually able to build you a nice package here, OK? It is the cost for the X gig with the pro Wi Fi, right, will be 189.99 cents. It is XX month offer. No contract is required. All equipment is included. Services also include, um, um, fail over, backup failover, wireless failover in any event that the internet ever goes down you get up to X hours worth of, you know, of internet still that way you do not lose any business The installation is 159.99. There are no contractual obligations. It is a XX month fixed rate. This is with auto pay. If you do without auto pay, it is 194.99 cents, and your taxes are only $4.38. I have availability to do this for you as early as tomorrow. I have between X and XXXX and X or X and X. I also have Saturday and Monday."" [Customer] ""And that I thought I remember Danny telling me there was something that was like $99. This is almost doubled."" [Agent] ""for We do have a $99 offer, but that would be with minimum internet. Like if you wanted to do the pro Wi Fi with XXX megabytes, you are looking at $99 your internet strength would not be XGB Not with pro Wi Fi. Now if you, let us just say, let us just say if you wanted to do a gig, bare knuckles, like uh if you just wanted to do a X gig package with the internet, the modem, no pro Wi Fi or anything like that, then you could do that."" [Customer] ""So OK, and so can you just explain to me the difference?"" [Agent] ""The promotional offer will be $100 before tax. Sure, so the package that I am offering you includes everything, as I said, not just the modem and the gig service, strength of the internet that you are going to need for your office, right? It includes pro Wi Fi with the access point. It includes, um, fail over, you know, sometimes for big businesses like that, you know, people find value and they say, hey, the internet may went down, but we do not, we do not need to be down and waiting for it to come back up. That is where wireless failover kicks in, so you still get up to X hours worth of connection on your internet. That is included with the pro Wi Fi as well as protection and support through aurion. So that is the package that includes all that would be 189.99 if you just want to go with the X gig, right, which is still, you know, it is still going to work as far as the strength of it, but everything else I just mentioned as far as for Wi Fi access point fail over, none of those things are included with the services."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""You just have the one gig with the modem and the Wi Fi service, which, you know, you can still connect but it is not going to give you like the access points and things of that nature. It is just going to be able to connect what it connects which is still up to you know, XX to XX devices, things of that nature in your office"" [Customer] ""OK So I do not get the extender or the uh access points."" [Agent] ""No, it does not include that."" [Customer] ""That And so how On that particular, uh, one gig."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""The office XXXX square feet. What do you think the the modem."" [Agent] ""I would suggest you take you, I would take the pro Wi Fi. I would, I would definitely utilize that for XXXX square feet for sure, because although I, I could tell you that the gig will work, right? I could definitely tell you the gig will work with that amount of space. Let us just say XXXX square feet, right? What ends up happening is sometimes on the back end you end up having to make an appointment to get us to come back out there and install that anyway and then you are paying, you are not getting it acquisition pricing or the other option would be to get a secondary modem which you are not even going to get a discount on, they will charge you full price for a secondary modem."" [Customer] ""And what is that?"" [Agent] ""Second book a gig a second modem is like over $300 just for that second modem. I would say try it the way, yeah, I would say try it this way."" [Customer] ""And so real"" [Agent] ""It is just my suggestion as a consultant. I would try this way because this way it is going to you are going to get the most out of what we can give you for for office that size. I am pretty sure when you and Danny spoke he definitely give you correct pricing when it comes down to what a gig costs, but perhaps he was not taken into a fact that what you were asking for if he would have packaged that in, he should have quoted you with the price that I am quoting you right now. He probably just quoted you with the standard gig offer which you could see actually on our website which is going to say $100 for XX months."" [Customer] ""Um, And so if I If I start off with just the one gig."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""And find that it does not work."" [Agent] ""You can always upgrade."" [Customer] ""Then I lose that I can upgrade."" [Agent] ""Yeah, yeah, you can always upgrade, but the upgrade price it will not be the acquisition price and it would be, it will be a slighter higher slightly higher price point. In other words, let us just say if you were to start off with the gig and then you would inch your way into things like pro Wi Fi, so forth and so on, right? You end up having to bill us over $235 or something like that when you could add everything $189. here is another suggestion, you know, just so you are aware, we offer a XX day money back guarantee which means you could try it the way I am saying try it. Right, if for whatever reason you are not satisfied and cancel the services within within XX days, anything that builds you refunded."" [Customer] ""But then I would have to go through the whole reactivation to make it just a straight one gig."" [Agent] ""I mean you can always downgrade to just straight one gig if you feel like you do not need it and you know that that you are just removing the add-ons out of your your offer it is not going to increase your bill. If you say hey I do not think I need the pro Wi Fi then they will just take it out of your offer."" [Customer] ""Right, and then they come back and they grab the access."" [Agent] ""They take the access points. That is correct you know, mhm"" [Customer] ""OK, I, I think, um. I think I am going to go. With just the X gig like I said there is going to be just XX people in at any one time and they will all be up in the front."" [Agent] ""OK OK."" [Customer] ""Of the building and the it is a warehouse so the back space. is wide open."" [Agent] ""Not a problem, not a problem."" [Customer] ""So I, I, I, yeah, I, I, I appreciate everything you have said you know we are, we are not that big a business to kind of double our expenses right now I just have"" [Agent] ""Mhm. No worries, yeah, absolutely, that, you know, again, I make the suggestions based off, you know, I always try to ask the customer first before you start throwing pricing and what are you utilizing them for when you said access point, you know, immediately I am going to, I, I know what that comes with. So I, I also understand, you know, when opening up certain things you want to try to stay to a certain number. So absolutely we can go with the X gigs, you know, bare knuckles, which is $100 with that being said, what day works for you was tomorrow good for you?"" [Customer] ""Um, tomorrow it does work, yes."" [Agent] ""OK, bear with me one second."" [Customer] ""And I mean if somebody was around today if that could happen, I have people going there today to tear up carpets so if you get a cancellation. I can make that happen too."" [Agent] ""Uh, I will schedule for tomorrow then if I can get somebody out there today, you are calling early enough where I could see if we can get somebody out there today for you If we can, I will reach back out to you directly. Let us see what time works best for you, but uh right now I am going to have to put, you know right now I will put what is available is tomorrow and then I will make a request"" [Customer] ""Sure, yeah"" [Agent] ""Alright."" [Customer] ""Sure."" [Agent] ""So tomorrow I have between X and XXXX and X or X and X what time works best for you"" [Customer] ""Uh, X and XX."" [Agent] ""OK. So once again, the monthly rate will be $100 flat. There are no additional taxes and fees. There is a one-time install fee which is $100. It is billed to you. It is XX month offer. Everything else as far as a XX day money back guarantee, that is still all involved, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Alright. What is the, can we use the number that you gave me, um is the best number to call on our way"" [Customer] ""Yeah"" [Agent] ""The XXX-XXX-XXXX?"" [Customer] ""Yes sir."" [Agent] ""And what card did you want to put on file for the auto pay?"" [Customer] ""Um, It is a uh Uh, Visa card."" [Agent] ""OK, give me one second. Visa card and the card number?"" [Customer] ""XXXX."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""XXXX."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""XXX. XXXX."" [Agent] ""That is XXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX or am I missing a number?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, you are messing it. So it is XXXX. XXXX. XXX X."" [Agent] ""XXX X. Uh huh."" [Customer] ""XXXX."" [Agent] ""Perfect and the expiration date?"" [Customer] ""X of XX. And the authorization code is XXX."" [Agent] ""Is this also on the Spartan reservation? Is the card, is that the name on the card or is it a different name?"" [Customer] ""It is uh Fred Cataldo and but it says Spartan restoration underneath my name."" [Agent] ""OK, is it built to the same address?"" [Customer] ""This is my corporate Um, Um My boss I do not know where he has this thing billed"" [Agent] ""XXX Ke Keyland Court?"" [Customer] ""I think it is billed to a Comac address I am not sure Do you need that right now, or I mean it, it."" [Agent] ""Give me one second. Let me see if it takes a card with it. If it takes the card with it, then it is fine. If not, then we would have to put a different card on file. Or give me, I will, I will make the attempt, OK?"" [Customer] ""Thank you."" [Agent] ""You are welcome. Yep, it is OK. You are all set. Your access code for this, I know you are driving, is going to be XXXX, that is going to be your access security pin."" [Customer] ""Like OK, uh"" [Agent] ""And I will email you your account number. I will send the email to the Fred at spartanspartanresto.com."" [Customer] ""OK, and can you email that access code to XXXX?"" [Agent] ""They do not allow, they do not allow us to email the access code that is private to you. What you can do is you can create your own though if you want to create your own something else that you think you can remember."" [Customer] ""Oh No, I am just driving right now and I will pull over and uh I will, I will write it down on my folder."" [Agent] ""It should be fairly similar, remember, the number XX followed by the number XXy so it should not be one to forget."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Some of them are like real complicated."" [Customer] ""Yeah, no, I, I am, I am pulling into my office now, so I will have a minute to, uh. To write"" [Agent] ""Alright, we are all set. Do you guys use mobile phone for your business?"" [Customer] ""Um, we already do yes, we have Verizon"" [Agent] ""You have Verizon. Are you on a contract of financing your device?"" [Customer] ""Uh, yes, we are.""

Up front, yeah, in the front office, um. It is a U-Haul office so it does not really matter. I do not need to keep any numbers specifically up front because U-Haul transfers. Their number. To my number, so advertised is not like I need a phone number so I can put any number there."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Um, I do have a mobile phone that I am paying for through Verizon for the U-Haul company."" [Agent] ""We can do that too."" [Customer] ""Um,"" [Agent] ""Transfer the cell phone."" [Customer] ""That Yeah, I do not really need to transfer that number either it is not like a usable, you know, it is it is not like a a number that is on any anything in particular."" [Agent] ""OK, but you could still switch over the mobile."" [Customer] ""Um, but do I use the same phone or, huh?"" [Agent] ""You can, you can definitely, um, switch over the mobile because it might be a it would definitely be a discount. So, um, can you use your own phone? You are talking about the, the office phone. Is it a Verizon phone or?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, my Yeah, my, well, the one. I do not have a phone right now up front. I am using some like I said right now I am using somebody else's. Um, You guys Optimum."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""So someone else in the front office and there is so many, like so many other people have been in there. There is like I think there is two other routers up front or whatever you guys call them modems or something and wires everywhere so I do not know who, what, where, when, phone numbers for all that stuff."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""I, I do not know. I would like to have my own that is mine that I know works when something messes up."" [Agent] ""Yes."" [Customer] ""I do not want this other."" [Agent] ""100% agree with you."" [Customer] ""Plus they are having me chip in for paying for some of it."" [Agent] ""Which sometimes is not working."" [Customer] ""Um, up"" [Agent] ""Which is not good."" [Customer] ""No, because it is costing me like $230 something dollars a month for phone numbers and phones and internet that I do not know if I am even using it."" [Agent] ""Oh yeah."" [Customer] ""But I do have um the security cameras upfront that run through the optimum that I would have to put on my account also."" [Agent] ""OK, well, let us let us go over it so let us help you out with this."" [Customer] ""I think So I Um, the one main line unless you transfer over the cell phone number, which it does not really matter to me, but you said it is cheaper that way."" [Agent] ""So how many phone numbers do we need to transfer? Let us start with that just the one. I can do the Yeah, well, let us get the main number first. What is that telephone number?"" [Customer] ""Um, XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Agent] ""XX OK."" [Customer] ""I kind of want to get a price on all this before I, you know, before I do it."" [Agent] ""Yes."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""So the reason why I asked for the number, I, I just wanted to see if um the number is still an active number with Verizon."" [Customer] ""Oh yeah, I did not cancel anything."" [Agent] ""OK, oh good, perfect."" [Customer] ""They are the ones telling me that the DSL is going to be out of the area, so I have to go to XG I am, I have, I am right next to power lines in a metal building"" [Agent] ""Yes mhm."" [Customer] ""My cell service is horrible."" [Agent] ""Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can, I can see that, um, alright, so let us take a look you are paying like $230 per month you said, right Is that including the Verizon?"" [Customer] ""That is, that is not even on my bill. No, no, no, that is just for the cable vision. I am, I am borrowing off of somebody else."" [Agent] ""Oh my god, and then you are paying and plus Verizon."" [Customer] ""Yeah Plus Verizon is another $15967 plus the mobile phone is another I think $50 or something for Verizon because I."" [Agent] ""Oh my God, no That is a lot."" [Customer] ""Yeah, and my, I have Verizon. Uh, mobile phone, uh, cell service for me and my family, which is another $350 freaking dollars."" [Agent] ""Yeah Oh my gosh."" [Customer] ""So I am, I am I am at my wits end here on how much I am paying for phone things"" [Agent] ""It is almost It is like a it is like $1000 that you are paying per month."" [Customer] ""Uh For for for for freaking phones."" [Agent] ""Yeah, no, that is, that is a lot. No, let us, let us, let us, let us help you out with that. That is crazy. No way. Alright, let me go in here. Let me give you. Win back promotion. Help you even save more money, so give me one second here. Uh, let us see. With one telephone line. Alright. So with us."" [Customer] ""Yeah, oh, I am sorry, my cell phone thing is XXX for freaking cell phones. I have a lot of cell phones."" [Agent] ""So I So on the business side I can help you with that one line right that business line so it."" [Customer] ""I got kids and wives and all that other shit, but yeah. Yeah, I am, I am I am trying to find that number"" [Agent] ""Yeah, if you go if you go with that it would be. XXX for the Internet. The office line. The cell phone, the the connection back up because I always put that on my accounts for customers because in case there is an outage of service be up and running at all times because just, you know, you, you are having issues now a premium tech support so in case we have to come out there, we come out there the same day at no cost You are you are going to be saving. I am not counting the cell phone service with your family plan but just overall."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, no."" [Agent] ""You you are you are, you are ahead of the game You are going to be saving a couple $100."" [Customer] ""Yeah, so I kind of, I kind of figured that. So, so that is for X phones now I have X computers"" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""So do I need two separate modems can I put a wire or list thing I run another wire to the other computer or something"" [Agent] ""No. Yes. You are going to we are going to give you a modem and a wireless router so that you can go with the X computers so you do not need X extra And the technician will set that up for you."" [Customer] ""OK, so they, they will run the wire all the way to the back room or what actually it is just do they use the old. Like there is cable wire here, are they going to run all new wire or is this?"" [Agent] ""So, It depends on, it depends on the line."" [Customer] ""Um, Right, but there is the line that line is, is, is being used for somebody else's stuff now."" [Agent] ""The technician has to test that line if that line is working, he will use the existing line if he feels he needs to run it, he will run it. That is all part of the installation which is only $100. So he will he will run a new line for you that is not a problem."" [Customer] ""So he would have to run a new line."" [Agent] ""Yeah Yeah they are good like that."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I am trying to get separated."" [Agent] ""They will whatever you need yeah, whatever you need to get done to make your stuff work is what the technician will do for you"" [Customer] ""Alright, so I actually I just pulled this thing up here. So what is the internet secure thing? I see there is like XXX, XXX, XGB."" [Agent] ""I am giving you one gig because it is a promotion that is not advertised because you are coming from Verizon, so it is so it is the highest internet speed."" [Customer] ""Uh"" [Agent] ""Believe it or not."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""It is a X year promotion."" [Customer] ""And then what does it go to after the X years?"" [Agent] ""Call us because we are in the business of not losing customers, so call us if we have to modify to fit your budget we will always do that."" [Customer] ""Yeah, cause I mean, for instance, Verizon, I used to be at $60 then the two years was up I called them, they kept me at the same. The next two years, it went to XXX and they would not do anything."" [Agent] ""Yeah, no, we do, we always we do not we are, we are a small little business on our department so we, our retention department is fabulous We will always help you. And as a consumer that is when you call if you do not, you know, if we can not help you, not to say that we will not, we will you know then you have every right as a consumer to go to another provider"" [Customer] ""Well, that is kind of what I am doing because I am set up."" [Agent] ""But we Yeah. Yeah, but we will always help you."" [Customer] ""I was just worried. I did not know I could take my number. I had the same number for what, 19 years. I kind of do not want to XXXX I do not know"" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""I know long enough that I can not, I do not want to lose my number."" [Agent] ""You will, yeah no, you always will, you always will I am going to send you an email once we are done. There is an email, so it is an, it is an LOA form that you need to fill out like to say that the number is correct and then you send it back and that is when we start the process of porting the telephone number over, make sure that it works."" [Customer] ""OK, and then how much does this cost me to do?"" [Agent] ""So yeah. The installation is only a one time fee of $100 and we will run all the lines that needs to get run for you."" [Customer] ""So I have to pay that at the time or you guys send me a bill for that with the first bill or another bill?"" [Agent] ""Oh. I, I send you a bill. No, we will send you on on your bill. You do not have to pay anything upfront."" [Customer] ""OK, and then as far as like these cameras, so I have to find out because."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""They are not technically my cameras. I kind of, I guess you would say rent them. If that can be transferred over, you guys hook that up also. I, I do not know what is involved with like I think it is just kind of plug one in and plug one in."" [Agent] ""Yeah, like the cameras there."" [Customer] ""Do they, so that is all part of the hook up what I need to existing."" [Agent] ""So yeah. Yep Yeah, so that'll be like the technician you let him know because that is part of Verizon, right? that that."" [Customer] ""No, actually right now, no, it is a camera company and they hooked it up to cable vision, but it is to."" [Agent] ""The cam OK"" [Customer] ""That $230 something dollars a month that I do not want to pay anymore, so I will give that bill back to him and he will shut it off or do whatever and I just want to use the cameras so I would probably have to hook the cameras up to my account now, but I do not I have to check with him with that."" [Agent] ""Yeah Yes. Yeah, so then."" [Customer] ""I got to check with the landlord to find out if I can do that."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""Now I am renting here. Do I need permission from a landlord or anything to do any of this, or this is, I mean, it is just running a wire, so."" [Agent] ""No, no, because we have, yeah, we have, believe it or not, we have two accounts here, so yeah, it is just running the wires, so you, we do not need permission for that, and there is other accounts that had our service before you."" [Customer] ""Yeah, it looks like there is, I said at one time there was like X routers up front or or modems or or whatever."" [Agent] ""I see that, yeah."" [Customer] ""There was a lot of stuff up there. And honestly, we do not know what works and what does not work."" [Agent] ""Yeah That is what Stuff, yeah, the technician will take a look and he yeah, he will be, you know, that is when you know when we make an appointment we want you there we well we need you there so that you talk to the technician and tell him, you know what you want and what you do not want he is he will definitely help you out with that."" [Customer] ""So that is why I do not want to use any of that old whatever is there. I want. I think that is what they did. Yeah, so is it the same type of cable like Verizon changed from DSL to fiber optics as you guys still have the same Whatever you are using, it is a cable wire, I guess, or?"" [Agent] ""Yes, definitely."" [Customer] ""Are they changing anything? They are not going to tell me next year that it is not available anymore and we are now XG only or something like that."" [Agent] ""Yeah, well, if they, if, no, I know we do not do that, but if they, if they do, we always keep the accounts you have a choice if we do change it to like, let us say fiber, you know, but we do not tell customers you have to change over to fiber. There is a lot of customers in fiber areas that still have coax cable, so we do not do that, you know. I do not know why Verizon is doing that."" [Customer] ""So we are still in the. We are still in the coax area. We are not switching to you do you have fiber optics or anything or"" [Agent] ""Um, let us take a look in this area. Let me see if it is fiber. Yeah we can do fiber. Let me just see here. If you want we can do fiber."" [Customer] ""Is that more is it better? Is it worth it or?"" [Agent] ""Um,"" [Customer] ""I, I do not really know."" [Agent] ""You are not really doing much upload downloading. I would keep with the coax cable for you. Fibers are really meant for like people like video people that are uploading stuff."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I just"" [Agent] ""But the coax cable, it should, it should be fine because the building, you know, then you are looking at like running like fiber lines. I am not sure if the fiber is closer to it is I would stick with the, I would stick with the coax cable because they are already in there. In the fiber."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I mean, we have had a lot of problems with the cable wires here."" [Agent] ""For now."" [Customer] ""Again, I do not know if it is because of all the splitters and how many freaking things there are, but."" [Agent] ""It is, yeah, we will we are going to clean that up for you. So it is, it is up to you. Do you want to set it up? Do you want, you know do you want to start a process I can not even have a technician come out there."" [Customer] ""Yeah, so this is going to be like one. Yeah, and maybe he come out and tell me what I need to make sure that it is not like, OK, you have to have fiber optics and then it is too expensive for me to switch it or something or?"" [Agent] ""No, fiber is the same price as Coa."" [Customer] ""Oh."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""Because I do have with the cameras and two computers, I mean."" [Agent] ""Yeah, the only thing that fiber that I why I am not recommending is because with the phone there is some features that you are not able to get on fiber."" [Customer] ""I will be still fine."" [Agent] ""Like the call um forwarding I believe you can not do that is why I am saying, you know, especially your phone with your business I want to yeah."" [Customer] ""Oh, yeah, cause I, I do need, I do need."" [Agent] ""That is why I am."" [Customer] ""I need one of the phones. My cell phone is, is forwarded to my cell phone."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so that is why I am saying stick with the coax cable for now."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And then the fiber comes in, then we can, you know, we can switch in."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""I, if I can give you a promotion, I will, you know, so I can do it that way. And if you want to do the mobile too, the only thing that you do have to pay up front for the mobile would be the same activation fee, which is like $20.87."" [Customer] ""So they do not They do not give us a phone for the mobile. It is I have to use a different you just use a normal, just any cell phone or"" [Agent] ""Yeah, what with the phone that you have now."" [Customer] ""I"" [Agent] ""We would use."" [Customer] ""Yeah, the phone I have now has been dropped way too many times in a cracked screen, so."" [Agent] ""Um, you can purchase a phone."" [Customer] ""I do not know if I would use that one I guess I could"" [Agent] ""I would, I, you know, you can, it is easier to use your phone because it is, it is quicker you know then if you purchase a phone you just have to wait for the phone to, you know, get done"" [Customer] ""OK. Yeah, well. I just leave a broken phone and then they do not have to worry about a screen that looks so pretty anyway."" [Agent] ""Yeah So let us take a look here. Let me go into the address. I just want to make sure I have the address right. XXX Route XX, and I have, I guess, Hertz, um, no, Hertz in here, uh, let me see."" [Customer] ""Yeah, Hurts used to be here."" [Agent] ""Oh OK good so then it is the right address, perfect."" [Customer] ""And and Eagle Eagle is do I kind of buy, I am I am paying their bill for the cameras and my computer."" [Agent] ""Yes. Yeah, yeah, let us eliminate that. Let us get you with your own service to save you some money."" [Customer] ""But yeah, cause he, he wants to save his phone number, so that is fine."" [Agent] ""He can, yeah, that is fine, exactly."" [Customer] ""I just want my own."" [Agent] ""Alright, so let us see here, so what is the name of the business going to be?"" [Customer] ""Black Diamond Garage."" [Agent] ""OK Great, and do you have the tax ID number for the business?"" [Customer] ""Yeah. Mhm Uh I usually remember it my mind is totally blank"" [Agent] ""Well yeah you are stressed out. I totally get it."" [Customer] ""I have it, yeah. Well, I spent at least an hour just trying to get onto the phone with a person this morning with Verizon after they gave me the number to call to find out about this thing."" [Agent] ""Oh goodness."" [Customer] ""So I was started out aggravated. You guys were only like X minutes to find a person."" [Agent] ""Remind me. Yeah, and remind me to give you a better telephone number since you have the premium tech support once we are done, OK, because they pick up in less than X rings."" [Customer] ""And it is not an automated system that just keeps going in a loop."" [Agent] ""No. No, no, not at all. I would not do that to you."" [Customer] ""Oh, that is what I had."" [Agent] ""Oh that is crazy."" [Customer] ""OK, I have a number."" [Agent] ""OK, I am ready."" [Customer] ""Yeah. I got XXXXXX-XXX."" [Agent] ""OK, so XXXXXX-XXX."" [Customer] ""Yeah.""

[Customer] ""No, this one's through Verizon. That is what I am trying to find here, um."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""The cell phone, um, the The shop phone number or the cell phone number?"" [Agent] ""No, I have the shop one which is the one that you want to transfer which is XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Customer] ""Yeah, so it looks like the other, the cell phone number is a Verizon cell phone."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""So I have, I I have X numbers here so you got to give me a second here"" [Agent] ""Take your time."" [Customer] ""Um, I just want to make sure I do not give you the wrong one because then my wife really might be pissed."" [Agent] ""Yeah"" [Customer] ""He does not. Do you guys have cell service also? Like"" [Agent] ""Well I am going to, yeah, the business one I am going to do."" [Customer] ""So if I decide to change the rest of my phone."" [Agent] ""Yes, so once you are active with the first line, you go through the portal you can switch over the other line So the first line, like I said, it is $45 after X months you get $40 off the business account, so it drops down to $5. Any additional line would be like, um, I believe it is $25 each line. Let me just double check. Let me make sure. Or XX depending on the plan that you get."" [Customer] ""Right now Yeah, I mean I have all iPhones and I have a contract with them, but this one phone is out of. It is."" [Agent] ""Contract is good."" [Customer] ""Monthly thing here. This one does not have a contract under it. It is been like, I do not know, way too long. They keep trying to get me a new phone and sign me up again here.""

And disconnect the internet portion the phones we will handle for you, OK?"" [Customer] ""Even the the mobile phone, the cell phone.""

[Agent] ""Yeah. Yeah, it is better than XXX plus the XXX that you are paying with Verizon, so you are saving a lot of money and getting more stuff out of it."" [Customer] ""Yeah, plus the cell phone with another, uh, I do not even know how to read this thing."" [Agent] ""Yeah, XX bucks."" [Customer] ""No, XX X XX."" [Agent] ""Yeah. Yeah, remember."" [Customer] ""Yeah, $46 for her freaking um."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so remember, so like if for the 1st X months it is $45 a cell phone, but after X months you get $40 off the account for this business account, so it drops down to really $5 a month unlimited talking tax."" [Customer] ""Uh, like we do not, we use it to send pictures, that is it. We have to take a picture of a trailer hook up or something, or we can, you know, mobilely check in a truck."" [Agent] ""Yeah Yeah And why pay $40?"" [Customer] ""That is all, that is all it is really used for besides dropping it and using it for."" [Agent] ""Yeah, why pay $40 you know, $40 a month when you can get it for, you know what I mean, that is crazy, $5 yeah."" [Customer] ""X, yeah."" [Agent] ""Let me go see here. And then I will tell you like with taxes, let me take a look here. So And then I, we are going to port this number, so give me one second for that the office number first. So I, so with the with the remember with the email that you are going to get from the company, right, it is probably going to be within like the next like XX minutes please make sure that you fill that out and return it because that is the LOA which is a letter of authorization to say that the number that you gave us is what you want to transfer that XXXXXX number and then the cell phone part of it that takes two days. Because they have to uh send that form out to you but it takes XX hours I think XX hours for them to process it so this one will be like within XX minutes, but the cell phone does take a little longer, right, just to let you know, OK, so let me go into that."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Yeah And make sure you do not call Verizon until you are active so I do not want them to disconnect the phone and then you will be losing your phone. They tend to do that stuff. I do not know why."" [Customer] ""Yeah, just, just to be resentful."" [Agent] ""Yeah. Which is not good, especially for business."" [Customer] ""Yeah, well, that is why I have not done anything, cause I did not really."" [Agent] ""Yeah. Nervous that is why I said when you, yeah."" [Customer] ""I want to have a problem with all this and."" [Agent] ""OK. Um So far so good.

So that is why I was asking because the is it a morning better than afternoon for you then?"" [Customer] ""Yeah No, I think, I think the morning is usually busier than the afternoon you also got to check in all their trucks and stuff."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""But Wednesdays, Wednesdays are not busy, right?"" [Agent] ""So"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, probably better off in the afternoon.""

By enrolling, you agree to these important details and the terms and conditions. Can you kindly confirm that you would like to enroll in the premier technical support? And if that is the case, I just need a verbal confirmation please."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""Perfect, thank you. Your access code is XXXX and your account number is going to be XXXXX-XXXX. XX. XX, just want to go ahead and read that back to you. That is going to go ahead and be XXX. XX-XX-XX-XX-XX. Let me just send that away."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""And I am going to do a pre-qualification survey as well that is just to make sure that our fiber lines are on the pole as we assume that they are so that everything gets installed as we have processed. OK, just sit tight for me a couple of seconds. I will let you know just what the. Pre-qualification looks like. Just a moment please. OK. OK, so right now it says that the pre-qualification survey will be done sometime next week, but I will speak to my supervisor so that we could go ahead and move it up potentially to like this Friday or so so that they could check the whole work and ensure that the wiring is that is there the way that it should be, um, if for any reason they check and they see that additional work needs to be done, they will pause the installation they will go ahead and um. Send it out to the construction department and just try and they will fix what needs to be done and we will be able to reschedule but for the time being it seems that we have had service here before years ago so it should not be an issue for us to provide um service. My name is Sandra I am the only Sandra in the commercial sales department Can I ask you one final question before you let me go?"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Can you tell me what you are doing for cellular service please, which company you have for cell phones"" [Customer] ""T-Mobile"" [Agent] ""Yeah T-Mobile, that is a great answer. The reason why I say that it has to do with a couple of things. Optimum now offers Optimum Mobile. And we use T-Mobile towers in the area to go ahead and power your cellular service. So, you could switch over for a business line with Optimum as far as the pricing structure is concerned, you can have an unlimited line for $47 That includes unlimited talk, text, and data with XX gigs of premium data. The price for the phone itself is XX I am sorry, the price for the service itself is $47 $45 plus $2 in taxes, so $47. But when you have a gig speed of service like you do right now with the order that we are processing on the 5th, no, it is going to waste your time."" [Customer] ""I do not want to waste your time."" [Agent] ""You get $40 off on the internet service."" [Customer] ""That No, no, no, I, I try to tell you, um, we have like XX with T-Mobile, and then we have been with them for like X XXXX years. I do not remember we are paying like XXX for X lines, so I do not know"" [Agent] ""That is OK. That is actually not a bad deal at all. That is really not a bad deal."" [Customer] ""I know."" [Agent] ""When, when you get that amount of lines, $25 a line, so XX x X, that would be $175 plus the taxes."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So basically taxes X lines times X, that is an additional $14. That is $189. So let us say that it is $200 with us as well. You actually still save money because you get that extra $40 off on the internet service."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So just consider it even if it is just one line for the office, you know, for you to buy it for you guys to do deliveries and things, you might just want to test it out."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""$7 for a delivery guy's phone number is not a bad deal at all."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""You can go ahead and um use existing line an existing phone that you may have, so just something to consider."" [Customer] ""It OK."" [Agent] ""Would you like for me to go ahead and help you out with that at this time?"" [Customer] ""Not right now."" [Agent] ""OK, but if that ever changes, um, we would be happy to assist."" [Customer] ""I will let you know."" [Agent] ""Thank you so, so much for your time. It was truly a pleasure speaking to you. Congratulations once again on your new business. Um, I pray that you that you have a wonderful, wonderful experience I do go ahead and say thank you so, so much for your time Thank you for reaching out to us."" [Customer] ""Thank you so much. So the only thing I have to do right now is wait for that email."" [Agent] ""Yep, that is correct. If you do not get it by tomorrow one o'clock."" [Customer] ""Oh, Um, OK, I already have it. It was it L L L A I D?"" [Agent] ""Uh, you see. It should be, um, yes, it is a it is to go ahead and make sure just read it and make sure that it is the correct phone number and that is to go ahead and make sure that we have your permission to port the phone number on your request. When you sign it, you send it back. We give that to Verizon to make sure that they know that we have your permission to take over. It is an LOA, a letter of authority."" [Customer] ""Oh, that was bad."" [Agent] ""No, no, I am the real I am the real deal"" [Customer] ""Oh, I already have this email, so I just begin finding and then it will, it will be good."" [Agent] ""Yeah, there you go, just send it back to them and they will be able to further assist, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK. So yeah, OK, no problem, thank you so much."" [Agent] ""Alright then, thank you for your time. Have a wonderful day and thank you for choosing Optimum. Please stay safe."" [Customer] ""OK, thank you."" [Agent] ""Take care. No problem.

They are going to install a gateway or a router with with XX switches so that way you can connect all your devices in it. Uh, tomorrow X to XX or XX to X. Oh, so But wait, I, I, I do have a switcher though. Uh yeah. So if you are providing uh a switcher for me then what I am going to do with the old one? Um put it away. I do not know. It is something the company gives you automatically because they are going to provision the gateway to the IP addresses so by the time you get it it will be provision already. The technician just go there to install it. Well, You can not, uh, you, you can just give me, you know, I can just with the with our own, uh, what is it called. Switch Listen, if you do not want to use, OK, hear me out. Or uh Oh, OK, so, um, if they, if they come, uh, they could just check right if it is like, uh, compatible or not. If you do not want to use a switch, you could talk to a technician, but as far as I know, they already accommodate the IP address into the into the gateway. So when they go to the location, they install it and it is ready to go. But if you want to tell the technician, you do not want the gateway or or the switch, I mean that that is something that they will need to tell you because I do not have access to the IP addresses anyway. Yeah, they get right, yeah, and you tell them yes or no, that is all, um, tomorrow X to XX or XX to X, which is better for you? OK. X to XX. And what would be a good phone number to reach you or reach somebody on site tomorrow between X and XX? XXX. Uh-huh. XXXXXX OK. XXXX. OK, so again XXX-XXX-XXXX, and who should we ask for? Correct.

And we will see you tomorrow between X and XX. Uh, wait, so Yeah, I want to ask you something, um, how, how much can I pay every month then with the internet? Uh-huh. Sure.

Then how, how You get it one way. No, um, If they do not if I do not want the, you know, uh, the device I just want the, you know, each, each computer with a different address, yeah, uh, the IP IT? You can tell, you can tell the technician tomorrow when he gets there and see if they can provision into your, into your router, then that is fine. But um, you know, that is something you need to talk. That will not be uh additional cost, right? No, no, no, not at all, no. OK, OK, good. Alright, fine, we will see you tomorrow then. OK, so yeah.

[Customer] ""Yeah OK."" [Agent] ""Um, what it, what kind of a business is this and what are we going to be connecting to that Internet?"" [Customer] ""So we were a photography and video production company."" [Agent] ""OK, and do you know more or less?"" [Customer] ""So we will need um wireless one."" [Agent] ""Do you know more or less how many devices you are going to be connecting to that internet one in there or employees you would have?"" [Customer] ""Um. Well, I it is X max X employees."" [Agent] ""OK, oK."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""All right, any type of cameras that will be going on inside of the business?"" [Customer] ""No, well you offer that service?"" [Agent] ""So what we offer is a static IP service. So when you do have remote cameras cameras, it is the better option to go with it with static IP, um, so that you are not losing your images, um, yeah, that is why we ask that question."" [Customer] ""Uh huh."" [Agent] ""Uh, do you have any customers that will come in and do you want to provide Wi Fi or or um or a Wi Fi for them?"" [Customer] ""OK No."" [Agent] ""No, no Wi Fi, OK."" [Customer] ""No, why is it? What? Tell me why that why is that important?"" [Agent] ""So the pro Wi Fi basically what it does is it it gives them access to your Wi Fi, but you do not want your customers really um using up all of your Wi Fi so what the pro Wi Fi is going to do is it is going to separate your bandwidth."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""You decide how much bandwidth is for the customers and how much bandwidth is for yeah, the business"" [Customer] ""Oh, Yeah, no, no, that is OK."" [Agent] ""OK, and then the other question that I do have for you, do you have any part of a break room or waiting area or anything of that sort?"" [Customer] ""No."" [Agent] ""OK. All right, um, do you, do you need any type of TV inside of the business for cable?"" [Customer] ""No."" [Agent] ""Alright, now our packages usually do come with one phone line for the business."" [Customer] ""No."" [Agent] ""Do you need additional phone lines be it for a fax security or alarm system?"" [Customer] ""Uh huh. Um, when it, when you say come with it, the price I am going to pay will come with a, a landline phone, is that what you are suggesting?"" [Agent] ""Yes, yeah, so it comes with what we do is we bundle so when we bundle we already, you know, we are bundling different things into the price to bring your price down. It is a it is what we call is a buy more save more so the more you get the more you save"" [Customer] ""Uh. Uh And the more I spend."" [Agent] ""Depends because you can end up paying for a gig speed and with the phone line it is not going to it is going to cost you almost exactly the same."" [Customer] ""OK. OK, so tell me, um, OK, so go ahead. I, I do not need a phone."" [Agent] ""OK, alright, so if we go ahead and do it for the gig speed, which is the faster speed, you are looking at a monthly, yes, X gig, so XXXX megabytes per second."" [Customer] ""One gig Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""If if you go with the X gig, you are looking at a monthly rate of XXX. That is going to be for the gig. It is going to already include the phone line and it does include the equipment. You have our XX hour IT support on the account as well for the business, and it would include a connection back up. That connection backup would basically bring you back up in case you lose internet at any point."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh, and what is the, the upload and download speed? Is it XXXX?"" [Agent] ""The down yes, the download speed is XXXX on the gig. The upload speed because it is a coaxial area would be XX."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK, oK."" [Agent] ""So that would be for the gate."" [Customer] ""Um, OK, and it is XXX a month?"" [Agent] ""Mhm that would be XXX monthly."" [Customer] ""There any Are there any specials that are running or any way I can get it cheaper?"" [Agent] ""So No, so there is no contracts."" [Customer] ""is this an do I pay is this an annual contract Or is it month to month no contract, OK."" [Agent] ""It is all month to month and it is a X year price guarantee on the gig, so it, it stays at that rate for X years. We can not change that rate on you for those X years and after the X years, the beauty of it is that you, since you are month to month, you can always speak to our attention team to see what new promotions they have for you for the speed that you, you, you allocate to your business."" [Customer] ""Right, well, the interesting thing is I have Optimum for my home and I attempted to get it cheaper earlier today and there was no way it could be cheaper, so there is no guarantee in X years it can be cheaper, is that correct?"" [Agent] ""Mhm Mhm. And that so they usually with our business accounts they do try to you know get it at least a little bit less than what you are getting at at that when you, you know, when, when it goes up, um."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""And again you do have the option if we do not get you to where you need to be that you can, you know, cancel the account because again we are month to month you are not penalized for canceling"" [Customer] ""Uh-huh, OK. Um, OK, so now, And now that I am having this conversation, if I were to want to think about it and call you or someone else back, do I have to restart the whole process over?"" [Agent] ""So what we can do is if there is something so I can look at are you definitely going towards the gig speed do you want to hear something else with the XXX"" [Customer] ""No, is that is one gig the fastest."" [Agent] ""Yes, one gig is the fastest."" [Customer] ""Yeah, that is what I, that is what I think I need, so."" [Agent] ""OK, so it"" [Customer] ""Yeah, is it, what is, what is the cheaper version of XXX? What is the, what is that cost?"" [Agent] ""So the cheaper, so the $500 the difference between the gig and the XXX is not that much anymore. What they do is it is a $10 difference you are losing half of the speed So it is really not worth going yeah with the $500 when you are going to lose half the speed."" [Customer] ""Uh."" [Agent] ""Let me see what I can do for you with pricing, um, to see if I can get it a little bit lower and this way we can, you know, um, finish this out."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""So just bear with me. I am going to put you on a brief hold, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK Bye bye"" [Agent] ""Thanks. Hold on. OK, so you did mention that you did not need the phone, correct?"" [Customer] ""Correct."" [Agent] ""Alright, so if we take off the phone, it is going to save you $15. Um, the other thing, um, it is still going to give you the gig it is going to save you the $15 and that would bring you down to $140. What I can also do for you, um, I the installation fee on this is, is $100. I can take off the installation for you, um, if you do want to move forward with that, the rate of the $140."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh. OK. Uh, when could it be done?"" [Agent] ""I will tell you now hold on."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""See here. And also just so you know to save a little bit more depending on how the business progresses um. If you were to go with our mobile that is also going to save you another $40 so your price for this would be like $100 and then you would pay for the phone line which is $45 so you really pay like $5 more dollars on this, um, but you will have a mobile, a line."" [Customer] ""So I currently have a mobile phone with Verizon and I was on the phone with one of your colleagues before and we got disconnected somehow they never called me back but um that discussion was had."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""The only problem is is that um I hesitate doing it because I do not know it is quality."" [Agent] ""OK, so we."" [Customer] ""So if I were to, if I were to go, OK."" [Agent] ""So we run off of the T-Mobile towers. So if you know the T-Mobile service, that is really what you would be getting."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I have not heard much good about it."" [Agent] ""Cause that is the kind of service."" [Customer] ""I have only heard yeah, I have only heard good about Verizon That is the issue."" [Agent] ""Uh, OK."" [Customer] ""You can ask around regarding T-Mobile. So, so XXX no set up charge."" [Agent] ""Got you. Correct. And the earliest that I would be able to do this is tomorrow."" [Customer] ""And then Tomorrow, OK. Alright, let me know is there a work number on this if I were to call you back?"" [Agent] ""So here is what I can do for you. What I can do for you, there is no obligation for you to keep it until it actually goes in, and even once it goes in, you have a XX day money back guarantee on it. So what I can do for you to get grab that installation and grab the additional discount. I can go ahead I can schedule you I can send you an email if you decide not to move forward with it, you would just email me back and just let me know, hey, listen, I am not going to move forward with it I have something else, um, and, and no harm done"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""We would go ahead and cancel and that would be it. um, if you do decide to move forward with it, at least you have it in for tomorrow or even Friday I have an availability on Friday."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, I actually can not do it tomorrow, maybe Friday, but, um, I really do not even want to do that at this point."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Um, is there any way that I will have to redo this whole process again? There is a work order I can call you back in the next X days."" [Agent] ""So there would not be a work order on it, but my question to you is what detains you from closing this now? Is it the price?"" [Customer] ""Because Yeah, you know, it is really a combo of I want to reach out to Verizon to see what they have to offer before I move forward."" [Agent] ""OK, oK, so you can definitely shop around. That is not an issue. Like I said, there is no obligation, but let me see if I can get it down a little bit more, um, since you are mentioning that mhm."" [Customer] ""Because right now, just so you know, right now, um, I am paying in the current office I am then I am paying $99 a month actually maybe it is $109 so if you can come close to that, that'd be wonderful it would be no major issue."" [Agent] ""OK, alright, bear with me, hold on, OK?"" [Customer] ""I do not think."" [Agent] ""Thanks. OK, here is what we can do Gary, so we can give you the gig speed If we do it on an auto pay, it would be $90. If we do it without the auto pay, it would be $95. You know if you are going to go with the autopay or without?"" [Customer] ""I will go with the auto pay on the credit card."" [Agent] ""OK. Yeah, so we will go ahead, we will do it for $90. We can do it with the free installation. It would be the gig speed with um the equipment already included on that one and um we again we can get it done for you on Friday from X to X."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Now will this have a wireless router so I can uh or or I can go hardwire? How does that work?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, so you can hardwire it and it, it is a what we call is a combined modem router, so it is, it is, it is both."" [Customer] ""OK. OK, and when if I have the computers there when your staff is there, uh, they can have everything set up?"" [Agent] ""So yes, so what they would do is they would go ahead, they would install the modem, um, and they would just basically wait until you know everything is up and running and just make sure that everything is working properly and then they would, you know, exit the facility."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh. I see. OK, oK, so let us do it."" [Agent] ""OK, so we will do it um Friday X to X and the best one, OK, OK."" [Customer] ""OK, let me look. Let me look tomorrow I know tomorrow is not good, um, you have a window."" [Agent] ""Wednesday?"" [Customer] ""A window for No, no, a window for Friday, a window of time."" [Agent] ""Oh, So it would be a X to X window that I have."" [Customer] ""X to X, um, that is good actually, uh, you know, I am sorry, not tomorrow but Friday is that is that for Friday."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Friday, yeah, for Friday."" [Customer] ""Friday X to X, yeah, that is fine."" [Agent] ""Alright, so we will go ahead and do it on Friday from X to X. It is $90 again with no installation that is going to be for the gig speed with your equipment included and that'll be installed into XXXX Highway XX, uh, Suite XA in Wall, New Jersey, OK?"" [Customer] ""Correct."" [Agent] ""Alright, so let us go ahead and um the last thing I need to do is just enroll it for the auto pay."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Are you going to do that with a card or a bank account?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, credit card."" [Agent] ""OK, let me go ahead and do that."" [Customer] ""You tell you anyway."" [Agent] ""Sure, is it a Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express?"" [Customer] ""Um, American Express."" [Agent] ""American Express OK, go ahead with the card number."" [Customer] ""XX I am sorry, this that XXXX."" [Agent] ""Mhm. OK."" [Customer] ""XX XXX."" [Agent] ""Uh-huh."" [Customer] ""XXXX"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""XXXX"" [Agent] ""Is that a Mastercard?"" [Customer] ""Expiration, yes."" [Agent] ""OK, and the expiration?"" [Customer] ""X XXX."" [Agent] ""XXXX OK. OK, so that has been successfully been successfully set up for the auto pay. Just know that the first month it is going to send you out a bill. Just make sure that you send that specific bill out then the second billing period will come out of the auto pay, OK"" [Customer] ""So I am going to pay the first bill it is not going to be charged to my account, is that what you are saying?"" [Agent] ""Correct, correct, they you would, you would send it out you can give us a call or you can do it online and I am also going to give you the account number for this as well.""

Did you charge my card?"" [Agent] ""No, there is nothing being charged on your card now. That is just that we just put that in there so that the auto pay will take effect that nothing will be charged until that second billing period"" [Customer] ""OK, and it is a $90 bill."" [Agent] ""Correct, yes."" [Customer] ""OK, OK, great. What do I need to do next?"" [Agent] ""So that would be it. They would call you on Friday from X to X just to let you know that they are on the way, and then that would be it."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh. Mhm."" [Agent] ""Then you will be we will get going for you with the optimum service."" [Customer] ""Great. Do you have you have my cell number"" [Agent] ""I have here XXXXXX-XXXX. Is it something else?""

[Customer] ""Uh hold on one second."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""I thought Oh cool alright so."" [Agent] ""Mm."" [Customer] ""It says, uh, optimum business hosted voice and Optimum mobile do not automatically record or however, optimum Business hosted voice offers a call recording feature that can be used to record calls with the consent of all participants. O the also it is called data records which contains information about the calls or direction but not the actual audio recordings here is a better break may is it is it in New York state only one of the One of the uh parties has to know that the call is being recorded and it is not for anything specific it is just that we have to record it for business purposes."" [Agent] ""Understood."" [Customer] ""OK, so optimum business hosted voice offers a call recorded feature and allows subscribers to record calls. It is illegal. So no, it is fine. It says with the consent what may be illegal in some states, so New York is legal Um, So do you have information about pricing on the optimum? Business hosted voice."" [Agent] ""Yes, sir. So that one there, Andrew. So that so right now you just have the service you guys provide the equipment it is how you guys are set up right now with the business hosted voice um."" [Customer] ""Uh, you know We have a modem I guess like uh. That"" [Agent] ""That is not what I am talking about though."" [Customer] ""That are qualified OK."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so what I am, so right now we provide you guys with the service for the phone lines you guys have your own physical phones, so with the business, so with the business hosted voice that goes away you are going to use our physical phones and have our service"" [Customer] ""Yeah. OK, now we use the same phone numbers that we have now?"" [Agent] ""So Yes, we can convert those numbers that you have today over to the business house voice side, uh, so the way that works it will be $40 each line. So you have X. So it will be XX times X."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""All right, and then to install them. It would be $60 each, so it will be XX times X. I am sorry, XX times X."" [Customer] ""I can, can we, can we lower it to. X numbers XXX. Let us say X numbers. I am sorry, X."" [Agent] ""You want to just leave one out?"" [Customer] ""You know what, just leave them on now, so I, I wanted to know like if we have it, I understand that the cost to have it installed. And what would my um. It will be each month because if I feel like we are paying a lot of money for the internet service."" [Agent] ""That is something different. I would have to get you over to the right department to see if you guys qualify for you to as far as what I can handle with you, you will be paying $240 a month for the, for the business hosted voice"" [Customer] ""Uh, not a problem, not a problem."" [Agent] ""The installation will be a one-time charge of $360. Uh, though just to let you know the process of it, uh, there will be two work orders essentially set up for you. The first, the first one is a walk through technician will go out there. And, and just make sure and set up a blueprint on where the physical phones are going to be sitting at to make sure that you guys have the um the correct uh ports, lines and switches. For each phone to work. Um. And then, um, we will order the phones. Get them programmed and get them installed from start to finish this could take about a month."" [Customer] ""OK, alright, no problem. Alright, so can I, um, so is so. Is there any how how am I trying to say is that I just to know like what features it has and everything because I look I see that it does have the um. Uh, it offers a call recording feature, so is that something we just do ourselves manually or we have to pay extra for that?"" [Agent] ""Uh, no, that, that would come with the, uh, bells and whistles, so that, that, that will come with it."" [Customer] ""OK, and with those calls that we decide to record them, does it where does it store the data?"" [Agent] ""It is going to be a software that you guys download almost like an app."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""It will be on your it will be on your PC."" [Customer] ""Perfect. That is all I needed to know. That is perfect."" [Agent] ""Mhm"" [Customer] ""Uh, all details. uh, alright, so. I guess the first thing is we got to set up like a walk through before we even do anything else, right?"" [Agent] ""Right, well, now it is important to understand that when the guy goes out there, he, he, that is all typically he is going to do. He is not going to you know, you already know the pricing, so be $40 each line monthly to install $60 each line Right."" [Customer] ""Yes, yeah."" [Agent] ""OK, cool, so he is just going to go out there and be like, hey Andrew, I am I am with Optimum I just want to make sure that where you need these phones you have all the hardware that you need. And he will just go there and make sure everything's there just in case they have to order anything or or do any sort of construction or fabricating to get this done for you um and then he will order the equipment the equipment would actually be mailed out to you guys so you probably have it in a box and then once we go out there, they will do all the programming um and get that going for you and then."" [Customer] ""OK. OK."" [Agent] ""Let me see here. Make this change happen for you one second. So we can do all X."" [Customer] ""Is it do we have, do I have to commit to all X right now, or can I because I am, it, it, it, it all depends on. Uh, we need like at least XXX, Say X we need like. X would be uh would be perfect for right now."" [Agent] ""It will be best if, if you make that decision, um, or once you know 100% that that is what you want to do just to avoid, you know, the appointments and then fees and. The wait time, mhm."" [Customer] ""No, no, no, X would be good because we are only really using X right now, so X I will select which numbers we wanted to keep and then um No, because right now that is you know see one through the main line for like. When would I have to give you the exact number for that?"" [Agent] ""That is fine if you need to call us back you can call us back."" [Customer] ""Oh no, I want to get it started because I know it takes a month, so, um. If I could, I, I just we decide the amount after the guy does the walk through. Like when he is doing it, I got tell I so let us do X or whatever."" [Agent] ""Yeah, I mean there is no contracts on set in stone."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""But you know it, it just be it is just, it just be best for both parties, us and you to make sure nothing gets crossed or forgotten or misunderstood."" [Customer] ""I No, no, it is, it is fine."" [Agent] ""Can you give me"" [Customer] ""I got it. I just need, uh, I need to set it up, yeah."" [Agent] ""So X We will do X, OK. One second."" [Customer] ""X hours I got here at XX. Uh You are good though. You really, I, I, I can not, I can not, you look so relaxed, bro. I am like I am going to wait. Uh. And XX hours a Now, can I, can we set up the appointment?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, that is what I am doing now. I, it is, it is, uh, it is a little of a process bear with me."" [Customer] ""OK I Uh, all good."" [Agent] ""I am sorry, I should have told you that that is what I am doing now for you."" [Customer] ""Take your time though."" [Agent] ""Mm"" [Customer] ""Um, and what, what, and I could, um, when we are done, is it possible you can connect me to someone with Internet service or? Should I Go back onto the internet phone line."" [Agent] ""Yeah, you, you should probably call back I would wait until this because the the the system So like one quarter at a time type of situation. So you would call at a later date."" [Customer] ""Oh, I, I am not going to probably make any work order for the internet. I just wanted to see what um. Oh, I, I just wanted a clear explanation on the breakdown of the charges."" [Agent] ""OK, so we would need to do that with you first."" [Customer] ""What is that"" [Agent] ""Do the breakdown of the charges because when I set up this they are not going to be able to get into your account and give you like an accurate."" [Customer] ""Oh Do not worry about the inside. I will not talk."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""I do not need to talk about that today."" [Agent] ""OK, one second. Let us see, so we are going to just do X. Zip code for you guys XXXXX. Have your account number here. And then the only thing I can not see is going to be um. The uh tax ID so we will be asking for that too, just to let you know for the business."" [Customer] ""Well we have it. you do not you guys have it right?"" [Agent] ""We, we probably do for security purposes yeah, I do I can only see the last X though I needed in full."" [Customer] ""Alright, no problem."" [Agent] ""OK. And. Go you go New York. And if we have any questions about this order we can reach you guys at XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Customer] ""Uh, let me give you a different number."" [Agent] ""Alright, I am ready."" [Customer] ""XXX XXX XXX-X that is my direct cell connection so it would be a lot easier."" [Agent] ""Thank you Andrew, appreciate that."" [Customer] ""No, no problem."" [Agent] ""And then I have an email on file here. Let me get that."" [Customer] ""Yeah, well, I wanted to ask you another question real quick before we go."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""Um, So if we were to um. So we said we were going to put uh uh the phone service. Under a different business name. With a different, uh, are we able to like close the one completely and reopen one?"" [Agent] ""At the same address?"" [Customer] ""Yeah Like, I do not want to lose our service, but because we have there is two businesses really, but to us it really does not matter, but I am wondering if we could. Get it Under the other name and then once it is hooked up we could cancel the other service is that possible? Or is it uh Yeah, it is going to be different with these phones though."" [Agent] ""Right, it is going to be different. So, um, there is two different ways you can do this. The way you are explaining it, um, there, there is going to be downtime. Uh, you are going to, and then you will lose the actual telephone numbers that you currently have today because the new account will get new num."" [Customer] ""Right, forget about we do not, we do not need to do it. It is not even a problem. I just want to do it. I do not want no downtime."" [Agent] ""I got you, yeah you do not want to lose the numbers so the other way to do this is there is a form that you fill out to change the name"" [Customer] ""Right"" [Agent] ""And then there is no there is no loss of service and you will not lose the numbers."" [Customer] ""Alright, no problem, that is fine this is fine. Just leave it out."" [Agent] ""OK, so we continue on."" [Customer] ""But there is there is not going to be much down time when they come to just do the installation right? it just be however long it takes."" [Agent] ""Yeah, it will be however long it takes. Um, I, I, I, I could see maybe some downtime, but I mean it should not be too long."" [Customer] ""Oh, that is fine, that is, that is fine, that is fine."" [Agent] ""Yeah, just for obvious reasons, you know what I mean, switching things over testing stuff out."" [Customer] ""Oh no, no, I get that, yeah."" [Agent] ""But uh we try to we try to minimize that as much as possible. That is why we have the um."" [Customer] ""Yeah, no, that is fine. It is like, um, yeah, no. I am talking to myself."" [Agent] ""I get it. I will talk to myself too when I need expert advice."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""OK, here we go. Then I can put your number here this is going to be for Andrew Alright, so the first number that you want to migrate over, oh hold on one second, let me make sure. This is lined up because there is just X that we are doing instead of X. And I am going to get those telephone numbers from you shortly.""

[Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""At your fingertips there, um. Make sure everybody knows how to use the phones."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Yeah, I believe they, they have been seeing you like a how to video for sure like a manual, so and they will give you that, that particular number, uh, once everything's been installed because it is a private number.""

Uh, the walkthrough is going to happen a lot is, is going to, right."" [Customer] ""XX, that is not the walk."" [Agent] ""So give me one moment. The system makes me work a little backwards here. The walk through is going to is going to happen, but I mean this installation that I am that I am giving you, uh, the, the 30th between XX and X, that could be moved up depending on what they find and how soon we get these phones and programmed.""

[Customer] ""Unless, unless there is a better package with the phone, um."" [Agent] ""Well, our phone services can be also used as a fax line."" [Customer] ""Uh, yeah, if you could price the Internet only and then Internet phone."" [Agent] ""OK, no problem. Um, so it is a $20 difference if you add the phone as a new customer."" [Customer] ""So about the internet, how many people will be using the internet service? Um, at any given time, at most X, OK, and on a busiest day, how many devices will be connected to the Internet? Uh, X X are you going to have security cameras? No. OK, so I can actually get you a really good deal for the. Phone and internet together it will be X gig internet X year promotion, no contract with the motorma combo included with the one phone line and premier tech support at $145 a month with autopay or $5 more without the auto pay. And what was the, uh, deal with just the internet? Just the internet it is $20 less, so $145 or $125. OK um. And say for example if you were to add the the phone service later on once you already installed the Internet service, you will not qualify to get it under a new customer promotion so you will be paying $40 with the existing customer promotion. Alright, um, yeah, so let us do the XXX. OK, and would you be doing auto pay or no auto pay today? Uh, and what is the difference between. Those too. So the quote for the XXX is with the auto pay. If you do not want to do auto pay, it is XXX, but nothing is due today, so I am not taking a payment from you today, uh, since we are a prepaid company, once your services are installed, your bill is due X days after. OK. I I will only set up the auto pay because we have to have that on file. To give you the discount. Um Well, I would like to do autopay I do not have my card associated with that account yet That is fine. Whenever you do, uh whenever you do enroll in autopay, the system will automatically discount $5 each month So at this moment I will be able to sell you the services at $150. OK. OK. OK. Yeah We did come up with a new product. It is called the connection back up. Um, what this does is it connects to the nearest cell phone tower whenever you lose internet service due to an outage or any technical issues. It is only $30 a month, and we do offer a free install with it today. Is that something that I could interest you in today? Uh, no, thank you. OK, and what would you like your X digit PIN to be? XXXX XXXX thank you and how soon do you need your service installed? Uh, ASAP. OK. Almo down sir. And while I am waiting on the system to save your information, I do want to tell you that you could save $40 off your internet bill if you bundle with Optimum mobile cell phone services. Do you currently have a cell phone provider for your business? Uh, yes, T-Mobile. So we also use the T-Mobile cell phone tower. however, it is still our individual company it is still under Optimum mobile. Um, how many lines do you have? Well, it is, it is our family. So I have one. A family plan? XXXX. And then X iPads, so X phones and X iPads. OK, we can only sell it this well you can start the services with X lines to begin with and then um so it would be $45 for each, um. For each tablet and then for the X phone lines it would be XXX. And then you would get $40 off your internet bill every month. Is that something that I could interest you in today? Uh, not today, but I will look into it. OK, sounds good, sir. My first available for the install is the 8th, Thursday. I have between X and XX or X to X p.m. OK, yeah, let me see you said the date, um. The 8th, uh huh. And and what were the two windows again? X a.m. to XX or X to X? Uh the X to X, please. Alrighty thank you. Alright, so just to recap your order, I am scheduling you for the 8th between X and X. We are installing XGB internet with one phone line. Monthly rate is set at $150. It is going to be a X year promotion, no contract with motor motor combo included, and premium tech support I did waive the $100 installation fee for you Our technician will call you XX minutes before arriving on XXX-XXX-XXXX.

OK, and is what is the suite number for that? I think it is X. OK, alright, it is OK if you do not have it right now when are you, um, when are you moving Well, the lease was supposed to be effective April 1st, but our landlord is a miserable person and has trouble holding on to staff, and so we do not even have the lease yet. Mhm. Um, I told him we are not paying any any $4000 a month rent. The place is way too big and it is not our fault he is dragging his feet, so. Mm. Soon I mean you know and and it is supposed to be retroactive to April 1st, so. OK, OK. Uh, hopefully in a week. OK, well I mean that that is fine. I just wanted to have an idea um let me just see here. OK, you have the back alright, yeah, so just allow me a few moments so I am just going to look into it and just see um what we would need um to have set up then I will just walk through the process with you so that you have an idea It does not matter if you are not certain on the day, uh, there is something I can, you know, work with you or even set up something tentative so it is not an issue, but let me get you the information you need and I will I will be right back OK. All right thank you. You are welcome. Now, as far as the um the space goes, the space is uh smaller than the space you are in now? Oh, much smaller mhm. OK, how much smaller would you say? 50%, 25%, 10%? I would say we have got maybe. A quarter of the space that we have here. Wow, OK, OK, um, and, and that would, would, you know, be that as it may. What kind of um what kind of business is this just so I understand what you are using the internet and stuff for. It is a law firm. OK, alright, so you are doing some uploading and downloading documentation things like that. Right. OK, alright, alright, so yeah, I am going to just put everything together, uh, miss you, I will be right back. OK. Thank you. You soon. Yes. The suite that you are moving to, uh, ma'am, can you tell me. Um, what business or what was in that suite before? It was I think it was called like high stakes roller or something um. That sounds exciting. Uh yeah, yeah, you know, they sold, um. OK, I see high stakes here. Like packages of, of, of cards like um collecting baseball cards and you know you pay an amount you probably ended up with mostly trash maybe there is a valuable card in there Oh, OK, I heard of that. Yeah, I never really got into that I know what you are talking, OK Uh, uh, It it it was that kind of thing, a lot of sports stuff. OK, OK, I see that. That is, that is really all I know about it high stakes something or other. Yeah, I see it here. I think it was high stake high stake breaks, so it is a little bit of everything that you said. Yeah Yeah, so that is exactly what I needed to do. Thank you so much. I will be right back. You are welcome. OK. OK, so I am almost finished here. I am just waiting for the dates and times to uh populate then I will be able to review everything with you OK. All right, the way things normally go, uh, we just ask that you bring, uh, the equipment from one space to the other space, and the tech will basically do the installation, uh, swap out or make any changes that need to be made, and, uh, basically, uh, set you up to be, uh, up and running, um, as far as, um, as I said, the timetable and everything, that is, you know, that is fine we will work on that. And um you will have a new account number so it is because it will be a new location but again as I said I will review everything uh with you it is pretty, pretty straightforward other than that. OK. OK. Alright, so And really the only thing we are taking then is our our phones that is really all that you would get involved in, right? Our computers would be our tech guy. Exactly, exactly. So we are going to be setting up your internet and your phones and uh whatever your tech um or your IT does, you know, you, you know, you will have them continue to handle that. Now, as far as your IT goes, um. Alright What do they normally do as because we set up everything so um do they do anything additional or are they on site or off site? Well, you know, like the, the, the scanner has to be programmed to the computers, whatever he does, there is some connection so that we can send our stuff to the scanner, um. OK. I guess the postage meter uses the internet to download postage. OK. So I do not know if he will get involved in that and then we have a fax machine that uses a phone line. Which is where you would come in I guess. Exactly, yeah, we, we provide that. So, OK, OK, so yeah, it is, it is pretty, pretty straightforward for, you know, law firms and things of that nature that uh we deal with. So, uh, pretty, pretty simple like I said, um, what I am going to recommend is, um, you know, whatever move, uh, date, um, we set or whatever it can be updated because I know that, um, you know, whatever's going on with your landlord dragging their feet it does not seem like, you know, it is you it just seems like it is set you know we will, we are able to make modifications if needed OK Alright, so yeah, again just going to bring everything up and I will, I will review the dates and times in a few moments. OK. Thank you ma'am. OK, so I wanted to confirm something here. um, can you tell me, uh, how many, uh, phone lines you have with us? Oh let me see now we have got XXXXXXXX X and X that is X. Then we have got XXXX that is X, and it looks like two brick lines. I do not I mean maybe they are forwarded from brick. Um OK, yeah, because I am showing on this side you have X with us just wanted to confirm. XXXXX. I have X. And then the fax, right? You can or you included the fax because that is usually the 8th X. XX no, X and X in the fax, yeah, that is right. OK, got it. Alright, just wanted to confirm, just wanted to make sure. Alright, so just um complete. Which, which we, we do not need that money. I mean we used to be X attorneys. And we are down to one, so we do not need that many lines. Mhm. OK, now. Right, so what I always recommend is that once you have your services, uh, installed in provision, then you make changes, you know I recommend no, you know I am setting up a move for you So if you want to take anything off or you want to change anything, uh, I would certainly recommend doing that once you, you know, once you have everything situated. OK, yeah, because I would say maybe we need our one and an overflow. And then there is this person who uses space. He has his own line in here, so that would be X maybe the brick line the fact, so X from X to X. Yeah, so I am again I am going to leave it as is because this is another thing too which is which really happens is, you know, you have X and you, you are certain you want to go to X, you may go to X, you may go to X so I recommend again you just have services installed because what I have seen is people eliminate one line too many and then they call back and they are going to charge you the price for that phone at that time and they are going to charge you to install it. So I always say, hey, just, you know, wait, you know, even if it is a day, even if it is a week, just wait till you have everything settled you make that determination because then you will not be, you know, paying for something again that you already would have had OK. Uh huh OK, so then after we are installed and settled, I could just say hey we, we can eliminate X lines we are not using them and. Yes ma'am, 100%. OK There is no contract or anything so you can make changes at any time. I just like I I have seen it so many times so many times. OK Alright, thank you. So again, like I said just just confirming those lines we are almost done. Uh Now Ms. Sue, um, thank you for holding. Uh, in regards to the, to the move, are you going to be on site, uh, for the move? Are you going to be present? Yes. OK awesome alright because I already have your contact information uh so as I said um it is just like um. I was describing, um, what you would do is you would bring the equipment over you or whomever, um. To the suite, uh, the tech is going to install and provision everything, uh, with regard to you um, we were able to Actually upgrade your speed um at the same price you are currently at so it is not uh no changes here um you are going to be at the one gig uh you are also going to get um it is also going to come with around the clock uh support there um with regard to the phone lines everything's going to come over the technical support is going to be for you to be able to call in it is also going to be able to. Uh, assist in replacing any devices, uh, and things of that nature, and they also answer in like, uh, XX seconds or less, um, with regard to, um, the set up and everything, as I said, um, you or someone just has to be present for the tech to set up everything they are going to take away anything they need to take over, um, take away and then as I said once the set up is complete, any changes that you want to make, I recommend um you do so at that time. Uh, as well, um, so you are going to be at, let me see, let me make sure I have the X phones XXX. OK, so I do have the X phones. You are going to be at $435 even uh there is a one time install of $100 again no contract, uh, there is no payment due today there is no payment due to the tech um, this is actually I think it is like $4 or so, uh, maybe a little more less than what you are paying before, um, and I am not sure if um. The office is on auto pay, but however you have been paying, just continue to do so um other than that, uh, as I said we are bringing the equipment over you, you really do not need to do anything, uh, you do not need to do anything else and if you are, you know, tech guy wants to be on site that is, you know, it is totally fine too other than that, like I said, we take care of everything. OK, so now you said 4:35. Plus a $100. Yes ma'am. fee of something. Right, there is a one time install uh for the tech, uh, the installation fee again, as I said, professional tech comes by installs everything, uh, takes away what they need to take away, uh, provisions, um, the phones and everything that you have set up and make sure that there is continuity there, um, with the uh. With the contact with the phones. Other than that, as I said, you do not need to do anything other than giving us a call to make whatever changes you want to make with the phones. OK, so 5:35. Is what we are looking at to get the funds moved over, OK. Yes ma'am. Right now I have um I know you do not um, you were not certain possibly on a date I have a Monday April 7th I could schedule for that and if you needed to make changes you could get back to me or we could, I want to set it out a little further. Oh no, that is Monday. um, I do not know are you thinking next week you thinking the week after What would you, what would you, how do you? Oh, I, I think, uh, I think the week after they originally said effective April 1st and they would give us the month of April to make the move but so I think they feel, you know, justified. Yeah. It sounds like they give themselves some time to So yes exactly they think they have built in some time for themselves so I am thinking maybe somewhere around the 18th X that is Good Friday we are not even here on Good Friday, um. Yeah. Yeah I was just looking at that. Um, so I am thinking maybe the 21st, so that is like two weeks from Monday tentatively. OK. Yeah, so the 21st, because we could, uh, the thing about it, um, this is I am going to email you. I am going to send you a test email in a few moments. So if you ever needed to make a change, like we are going to set it for now for the 21st for Monday I have XX to X I have X to X. The XX I am sorry what is this the XX. Monday the 21st I have XX to X I have X to X. Monday the X XX to X. OK, so XX to X it is, and what I am going to do is I am going to send you a test email to whatever email I could either send it to the one that is on the account you can provide me one directly to you Is that And do you have MWCD is that the one you have at up online.net? Go ahead. This No, this is Triple M WFC. Oh gosh, no, that was, you know, X lawyers ago it is it is uh let me update it. Mhm Please. M W C D At opt online.net. OK awesome so that is MWCD at optline.net. Yeah, my office mate wants to ask you something too about the move. OK, hold on a sec. OK, sure. OK Thank you for holding. We sincerely appreciate your patience. Please stay on the line and we will be back in a moment. Hi, um, this, uh, including like the wall jacks part of the installation cost. Hey When you say wool jacks, what do you mean specifically just so I make sure I am I am getting what you are saying So like Well, like, um, there is a, there is a desk going in a certain area there is nothing on that wall so I would think if we had a phone there would have to be unless you can just run wires up the ceiling and down the wall So what the tech does is they are going to set it up like um you know for your convenience for you to you know be able to do what you need to do with that said though, if it is something that is outside of what we do like we provide you with the phone service and we are going to make sure that you can, you know, plug your phones in and be ready to go, but if there is like something additional that is how that is kind of outside of it that you know it is kind of dependent but you know what you are describing it does not, you know, it does not sound like it is an issue. You know Well, what I mean like where, where you are going to plug the phone to if there is not some place for you on a particular wall that you can not plug the phone into, is that part of the place? Well, Well that is what I am saying they are going to set you up so that you are good and be able to utilize your phone so if it is something that they need to do or we need to do to facilitate that we will set that up now if there is something like, you know, additional that you know is is out of our purview like what you are describing does not sound like an issue sounds like you know you we we would be able to set you up so you would be good to go with the phones. But, um, you know, if it is, you know, anything major like they have to get on a seriously high ladder and put it somewhere, then that is not something they will be able to do. OK Oh gosh, no. No, no, no, no, I just wanted to, if you are saying like, you know, set up, you know you will be able to get us phone service and plug the phones in for us Yeah we will be yeah we will be able to set it up so you are good to go it is just, you know, they are not, you know, going to do. Like and that example is the most accurate. Like sometimes people have like a really high high place and they want us to set up something there and you know our ladders only go so high. No, it is just that right now on that wall there is nothing to plug the phone into, so I was just wondering if that if you provide that plug in. Yeah, so, yes, exactly, yes we do we are going to set it up so you are going to be able to just we call it plug and play. We are going to set it up so you are going to be able to plug in the phone and be ready to go. Oh, OK. Oh, OK, that is perfect. OK, that is what I wanted to know. OK, you apply anything else? No, that was it too. Did you need to talk to me again? So she said she will be in touch with you when we have a more definite. Well, I just have to, um, I just have to confirm, um, with Sue because I am going to set it for this tentative date I want to, um, you know, I need to make sure that she receives my email as well I just need to speak to her for about XX seconds. OK, hold on a sec, thanks for your help, hold on. OK. Tyrone. Hey this is, so yeah I just wanted to confirm I am going to send you, I am scheduling this for the 21st from XX to X. You are listed as my contact person and I am going to email you right now so that if you need to change the date you can send it back to me. OK Alright, so I am just going to confirm that the number I have for you is XXX-XXX-XXXX. Correct.

Alright, do you guys like have a new lease or anything like that for this location because they are going to want to verify that there is going to be a new person there that way you can turn it off because it outside of that we would have to.

You do not need anything that is there already like you know the phone numbers or anything like that, right?"" [Customer] ""No, we do not need anything other than internet.""

It shows that there is an active account there, but it looks like the account is in collections. They are opening up an urgent care here. They are asking, you know, as far as proof, can they send over article of organization because I told them, you know, typically we take a lease, but they was like we do not have anything like that. We have nothing to do with the previous company that was there. If I give you the account number, could you do you mind taking a look at it?"" [Customer] ""Now that is going to have to be something they are going to have to take up with collections because I would not know on that one what they could send in and what they can not send in."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Got you. Do you mind taking a look at the account and seeing like."" [Customer] ""I do not mind."" [Agent] ""Sure, it is um XXXXX-XXXXXX customer number X.

[Agent] ""It is like $5000 over here."" [Customer] ""Mhm. XXXX."" [Agent] ""You know, so whoever was here bailed on it."" [Customer] ""And it is a new customer trying to move into this same spot?""

[Agent] ""I was like, you know."" [Customer] ""Not here. Because, um, You would have to disconnect this customer that is already here."" [Agent] ""Right.""

[Customer] ""Yes, to see if collections could help them, um."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""It says uh the account notify. That does IT work for this company he is not responsible for the account balance To contact, uh, OK, yeah, collections might be able to contact that number or retention, uh, to see if they could resolve this, but I doubt they are going to pay."" [Agent] ""I do not think they are going to pay either. They probably just want to know what can they receive to prove that there is someone new there."" [Customer] ""Right, and so they could get to collections and collections."" [Agent] ""Give me one second, mm."" [Customer] ""I could probably help them with that.""

It is not in collections or anything like that. When I spoke to our sales support team, they said, you know, you may need to reach out to collections to see what other form of information you guys would accept to kind of, I guess, assist them with setting up their business. They said that they have something called um Like a lot of organization. I told them typically you guys would need a lease but yeah."" [Customer] ""OK. Is there, is there, is there a hold at the address?"" [Agent] ""There is no hole in the address. It appears I could give you the account number if you want to take a look.""

[Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Verizon and it did."" [Customer] ""To to Verizon, mhm."" [Agent] ""And what is that telephone number we had here previously?"" [Customer] ""The same one, the XXX-XXX-X."" [Agent] ""Area code XXX or XXXXXX."" [Customer] ""XXX, XXX mhm."" [Agent] ""OK XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Now services here do you guys have an IT team?"" [Customer] ""No, we do not."" [Agent] ""No, that is OK. When the tech comes out they are going to set you up with everything in full with the equipment. Now you guys are never in a contract, as you know you can always upgrade, downgrade any time"" [Customer] ""Mhm. Mhm."" [Agent] ""We will come out and supply you with that Internet modem if you need, I can ship you a physical phone with the um with like a wireless handset if you have your own physical phone you can use it with the equipment."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Yeah we have um."" [Agent] ""And then even with the service you will just connect them into that phone modem and they can even supply you guys with the connection failover device."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So if anybody hits a nearby pole, say the Internet comes down with the weathering, anything of in like an internet outage for you guys, it will automatically kick back up for you."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Mhm."" [Agent] ""So if you have like your POS, anything that is critical for your business here."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And then even with that we do also give you guys premier tech services just in case if anything happens on site you get a direct number they can even remote access your equipment, any type of outage you guys are having."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK"" [Agent] ""And you are eligible for new customer promotions here. It looks like before you guys are with the XXX megabytes per second. We will definitely upgrade you guys into a faster speed."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""That is going to be your high speed of XGB so you will get XXXX over XX megabytes per second"" [Customer] ""OK, I think, I think that is probably what our issue was. I just did not know what our internet capacity was because our internet was really bad. It was like a really, really bad slow service."" [Agent] ""It was just the speed that was giving you an issue."" [Customer] ""Yeah, it was a it was a, it caused a lot of interruptions with credit card transactions, you know, and we are becoming very frustrated, but I do not know about this, so I did not know what our speed was or anything, and then it is like it is such a fast paced environment for them to have to get on a phone and call the company and go through all the steps. It is it is very hectic."" [Agent] ""And especially when a card machine, you do not want somebody to stand there to wait to have to."" [Customer] ""So it sounds. Exactly, yeah."" [Agent] ""Mhm"" [Customer] ""OK, so"" [Agent] ""Now even with the service, do you guys have like a um like a so when the customers call and do you have a roll over line or it is just that main number they call?"" [Customer] ""Mhm. No, it is just a main number."" [Agent] ""And then nothing set up for like emergency purposes it is just that one line."" [Customer] ""No, it is just that one line. It is work, it is been working for years that way, so I do not think we would want to change that. We just want to make sure that we get the right internet speed and that there is no interruptions with the actual, you see, the thing I, which I did not realize with Verizon was that the phone lines do not work like they work with the internet, that that is horrible for us because if something goes wrong with the internet, then we do not have um phone."" [Agent] ""I see and did they give you that like um I forget what it is called but it is like a physical phone with them where it wants to have voice over ID yeah."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, it, it, that, that was horrible. Like if we would have, we have it we have service right now, we have that service, but what happens is if there is any interruption with the internet, that what we provided was a secondary phone, and that was my son's cell phone. So every time that we have a problem with the internet, all the calls roll over to his phone to make the credit card transactions we have to use his phone and it was a disaster. Like that that that can not be like we need a landline to work as a landline you know, not"" [Agent] ""Oh yeah, definitely not. Yeah, not a you do not want to go to a cell."" [Customer] ""To work Yeah, exactly."" [Agent] ""Now it is even good with this when I give you that connection failover because that business phone is critical for you guys with that failover you can put in up to X devices that are critical, so I would recommend definitely putting that POS and that phone."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Mhm. Mhm."" [Agent] ""Therefore, anything happens then an outage pole goes down, you guys are still up and running"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""It does not have to go to your cell phone."" [Customer] ""Can I, can I put you on hold for one second, please?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, take your time no rush."" [Customer] ""Thank you. Hello?"" [Agent] ""Yep, I am still here can you hear me?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, I was trying to get another call but it did not go through so I am, I am here."" [Agent] ""Now with everything here because I know before it looks like you guys were in a standard when you open back up I can give you guys new customer promotions and even extend that period so within the pricing here for you guys I am not too sure what the equipment that you have with files, but if you are in a contract with them, I could send you over a document anything that is like an early termination we can help you guys out with that here."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Mhm. OK, I do not even know what they are, what it is if we are in the contract not we just do not want that service anymore, so"" [Agent] ""And even with you guys you should be in like a probationary period so you might just be able to return everything with the equipment."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK, well, once I have them set up with with you guys then I am going to proceed with you know, terminating the account all that because you can not be left without any service"" [Agent] ""And then And we will make sure we will handle all of the phone stuff for you guys so when we come out we will make sure that same number is up and running."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK, so there will not be any interruption with the phone line uh switching from one company to the other, right?"" [Agent] ""Correct, yeah, it is seamless so as soon as we come out, put in that equipment, it just comes right over from the other company."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK."" [Agent] ""And then in that price promo I can price lock you for XX months, X years, never a contractor just price guaranteeing and with that X gig all of your equipment, even with that telephone line I could price lock you at XXX with the auto pay."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Mhm."" [Agent] ""If you guys do not do the auto pay, it comes out XXX, but if you do, it comes out XXX."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK, um, OK, that is, that is what it is, it is fine."" [Agent] ""And then typically I get you guys back up and running there is a $100 fee, but I can go ahead and waive that for you guys here since you are going to be coming back over from the other company here."" [Customer] ""OK. I appreciate that."" [Agent] ""And the only thing I need from you, what is a good email address I could send some paperwork to?"" [Customer] ""Mhm. Yes, hold on, I will give you the business email. It is TIO it is actually the name of the business CIO. Many market Uh, hold on, hold on, hold on, I want to give you my info. FTO Mini Market Deli. XXXX at gmail.com."" [Agent] ""Perfect, the same one I have on file."" [Customer] ""So it is yeah yeah yeah it is the same email mhm."" [Agent] ""And I am going to send you what is called an electric letter of authorization. It is just going to release the number from Verizon."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Therefore I could take it over."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Yes, OK, and you are going to send that now?"" [Agent] ""It should be there about X-XX minutes. I am going to send you over a test email just to make sure you get my contact."" [Customer] ""OK. OK."" [Agent] ""And with this here to know when are you available for install?"" [Customer] ""We are open X days of the week from 7:30 in the morning to XX o'clock at night."" [Agent] ""OK, perfect. Now I am going to try to get you guys in soon here."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I am going to take a look in Brooklyn with that ported number. I will be right back with you here."" [Customer] ""Mhm, OK, thank you."" [Agent] ""You are welcome. I will be right back"""

[Agent] ""No problems."" [Customer] ""I was just I was just sitting like on, on the phone"" [Agent] ""No, no worries, uh, this should be enough information you can always add that at a later time."" [Customer] ""So yeah, whatever. OK."" [Agent] ""OK, and one last thing, your email address?"" [Customer] ""OK, yes. Uh, J as in Joseph. C as in Carrie. Dave D A Y S XXXX at gmail.com."" [Agent] ""And so you said 10:45?"" [Customer] ""XXXX"" [Agent] ""XXXX at gmail.com."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""OK perfect just bear with me one minute I am going to place you on a brief hold."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""OK, thank you for being patient."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So let us see here, so based off the information you have provided for me, I would suggest the one gig speed here. So that is our fastest speed in the area that would definitely accommodate all the devices that you currently have and give you room to grow in the future, you know, like a school academy type of place if you expand with more employees, more students, or just more people or devices at the location, the one gig will definitely handle it."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Uh, promotion also comes with one phone line."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I do not know if we had covered that or not, but it does come with one phone line. So technically you can use it for incoming outgoing calls, fax machine, alarm system. You can use it for any type of scenario. Would you need more than one phone line for the location?"" [Customer] ""Um, well, let me just, uh, um. Let me just uh give you a little background uh. Uh, Verizon was coming out to, um, hook up the phone. It is the type of phone, you know, you plugging the phone into it."" [Agent] ""Mhm, OK."" [Customer] ""So, um, Uh, they are going to hook up like about maybe like about um Let us see. I think they were going to hook up like X lines or something, jack phone jacks. But they charge too much."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""So, that is why I was calling to find out my other options you know"" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Because um Yeah, uh."" [Agent] ""And it was going to be X phone numbers or X phone number?"" [Customer] ""So, are you able to Well, I was going to have. Um, I guess I do not know, X different phone numbers, X different phone numbers, maybe just X."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Let us see, the place is not so big, so I mean."" [Agent] ""So I will give you the price with the one phone and then adding a second line."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""So with the internet and one phone line, monthly we would be XXX. If you add a second line. Monthly rate would be XXX. With adding a second line that is the internet now with two phone lines."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Same thing, no contracts with us like Verizon. We have no contracts. I believe they have a X year or X year contract, uh so I mean if you have to stop service for whatever reason There is no cancellation fee. There is no penalty disconnect fee, nothing. You would just give us a call and stop service no matter what the reason, and that is it. Uh, it is a one time install fee for the technician to come out and get the service set up for you guys. It is a one time install fee of $100 that would be on the first bill."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So second thing is, like, for example, we do place an order for you today and hold everything in place, um no payments are processed today, nothing is given to the technician during the install everything would be on the first bill"" [Customer] ""OK. OK. All right, um. Well, I, I purchased two phones for Verizon. They work on your line?"" [Agent] ""Are they standard phone jack phones or?"" [Customer] ""I I can use One of them is the other one is not, I do not know, I, yeah One of them is I think one of the other one is it."" [Agent] ""I can not"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""I can not speak for their equipment because I am not familiar with it, but if it is a standard phone jack, like just a standard phone jack that is been around forever, then yes, you should be able to use it, but once again I can not 100% speak for it. I I have not seen it or anything. Um, worst case scenario, you can always purchase any type of phone for our service."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So from Best Buy, Target, Walmart, wherever you go, you can easily pick up a phone. It is not something that you have to special order through Amazon or something like that."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Any type of standard phone or office phone will work with our system."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""When were you possibly looking to have this set up by?"" [Customer] ""Alright, so Um, as soon as I could."" [Agent] ""Let me take a quick look at something."" [Customer] ""So, Yeah."" [Agent] ""So we do have a spot for Wednesday between X a.m. and XX a.m. We also have Thursday X to XX or XX to X."" [Customer] ""Uh, yeah, I I am, I am out of school, uh, after X o'clock And I would have to check with the owner."" [Agent] ""So anything after X would be good for you?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, like like XX o'clock, you need time to get there, X o'clock."" [Agent] ""So Would anyone be able to be there just until let us say you would arrive or?"" [Customer] ""Mhm. Uh, yeah, um."" [Agent] ""Because we typically have X to X."" [Customer] ""The older you should be able to go to the X, OK."" [Agent] ""Yeah, let me see if I could get XX for you."" [Customer] ""Yeah, um, OK."" [Agent] ""What day would work for X to X, Wednesday or Thursday?"" [Customer] ""One is good."" [Agent] ""Wednesday would be good. Let me talk to my supervisor. Give me one second."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Let me see if we can get X to X for you."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Be right back."" [Customer] ""OK, thanks."" [Agent] ""You are welcome. OK, thank you for being patient. So yes, we could do uh Wednesday X to X."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Perfect"" [Customer] ""All right, and uh let me see if I can give you the EIN number. uh, I have it. OK, so. And I know. Yeah."" [Agent] ""Oh, and I am sorry, I said Wednesday, also Tuesday we could do tomorrow or Wednesday X to X, so whichever one you like."" [Customer] ""Uh, Wednesday would be better because I, I think I, um. Yeah, I will be coming out of school late tomorrow, so. Yeah, so Wednesday would be better for, uh here is the uh number"" [Agent] ""Perfect. So let us see. OK."" [Customer] ""XX-XXX XXXX"" [Agent] ""XXXX perfect thank you. Oh and also what four digit access code would you like to use for that account?"" [Customer] ""Actor code, um."" [Agent] ""Correct."" [Customer] ""Um, So, what would it be, what would that be for? like what would I?"" [Agent] ""So for example, let us say you, you call in you have someone call on your behalf, you can use either the last four digits of the tax ID number for security purposes when you are calling up for that account or the X digit access code So if you do not want to give someone the tax ID number like the last X, you can give them the access code and that is something you can always change on that account as well."" [Customer] ""All right, so I will do 10:46."" [Agent] ""10:46 OK perfect. And just to let you know also we have a backup system here at Optimum for Internet service through a cellular network that we offer. So for example if you have any outage in the area due to inclement weather, an issue with the utility pole, no matter what the scenario is, it would automatically kick your Internet over to a cellular backup to where you would never lose connection at the location. It will not be full speed like you are getting now at one gig because it is over cellular you would still be able to use your devices You would still be able to work and maintain your day to day flow at the office. We do offer that for $30 if that is something you want to try out monthly, same thing no contracts"" [Customer] ""Oh yeah. Uh, $30 a month."" [Agent] ""Correct and it is contract free you could take it off at any time."" [Customer] ""Mm. Mm. OK, I, I will wait for that because I, I, I am not even, I do not have any computers yet, so, and I will probably be like can I save at least $90 before I start that."" [Agent] ""Oh OK. No, of course, so yeah, you can always add that on at any time."" [Customer] ""Uh, OK."" [Agent] ""Perfect, so everything is all set for the 7th between X and X just to give you a quick recap once again, monthly rate's going to be $170 to your promotion, no contracts, and it is a one-time install fee of $100 that'll be on the first bill. Nothing is given to the technician once again the day of install. The tech will give you a call about XX-XX minutes out. Um, oh, what number would you like the technician to call again?"" [Customer] ""XXX XXX-XXXX"" [Agent] ""Perfect, thank you. And promotion also includes our, uh, protection plan powered by Assurian. So for example, if once you have any issues at the location, if it is related, non-optim related, it would never be a fee for a tech to come out that is powered by Assurian and technically valued at $30 as part of the bundle and. Everything is all set for you."" [Customer] ""OK, so um. Uh, so, so every month, what is my monthly bill going to be?"" [Agent] ""XXX."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And once again it is no contracts you can stop service at any time without any penalties or cancellation disconnect fees, nothing."" [Customer] ""Alright, and you guys OK. Right, and they are going to set up two phone jacks for me, right?"" [Agent] ""Correct, well, two phone lines. So the phone service comes through our modem, right, same scenario, so that it is going to be powered technically through the modem, but they are going to set up two phone lines for you."" [Customer] ""Or something like that. Yeah. Right, so, so what I mean is like, are they going to be jacked on the wall type thing or?"" [Agent] ""No, because no one does like the jacks type of um scenario anymore."" [Customer] ""I, I do not know."" [Agent] ""Those are old copper lines. So if you have like office phones or let us say like satellite phones, they could be anywhere on property and they will pick up long as the main phone is plugged into the modem, then the other phone could be X offices away just give you an example, it will ring you could pick it up. So it could be anywhere at the location."" [Customer] ""OK, so, so I am going to have X different phone numbers?"" [Agent] ""Correct, you would have X different phone numbers. You can do call forwarding, call waiting, of course you have. So for example, let us say you only give out X number. So let us say you are on both lines you are on a phone call. Another call comes in."" [Customer] ""Mm."" [Agent] ""You put the first person on hold. You talk to the 2nd person, and if the 3rd call comes in, it will automatically roll over to the 2nd line, so someone else would be able to pick up that line the same thing if another call comes in, they will be able to put that person on hold and pick up."" [Customer] ""Right. Mhm."" [Agent] ""So now technically you have X lines, both a call waiting, so you can handle like X calls at the same time."" [Customer] ""Mm, so I, so I would just purchase a regular phone and plug it in?"" [Agent] ""You would need an office phone for that type of scenario yeah, you could purchase in the meantime any regular phone"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""And it will work."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And then let us say as you guys grow you can look into like bigger office type of phones to where you might have a call like to put the person on hold they might hear music in the background you could transfer it or something like that, but you would have to see what type of phones you need for the location."" [Customer] ""OK. Huh, OK. That sounds like a challenge just to get a phone."" [Agent] ""No, it is easy. I hear a lot of people."" [Customer] ""Not many phones I have that I can not really."" [Agent] ""Yeah, well, hopefully."" [Customer] ""I have X, I I have X, go ahead, sorry"" [Agent] ""No, no, go ahead."" [Customer] ""So I have one, It is like some sort of Verizon mobile office phone that I Can not you Um, and then that, then there are the two other phones, well, XX that I got stolen, and then I have the X other ones that are brand new. I, I, I have these phones, right. Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah. So that is why I was like this phone thing is so confusing."" [Agent] ""Hopefully the ones that you have should be able to work if it is a standard jack with the phone, then you should be fine."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK. OK."" [Agent] ""If anything that would definitely say see if you can return them, but it is a standard type of office phone you or and it should say standard type of jack you should be fine."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK. All right, sounds No, it do not show me, right, when they come, right?"" [Agent] ""X, 100%."" [Customer] ""Hopefully, well, hopefully I will be there when they come. OK."" [Agent] ""Yeah, but they will show you and even if, if anything, ask them to, you know, explain certain things to you that is what they are there for they will go over the whole set up with you."" [Customer] ""Oh. OK. All right, that'll be good. As long as I can use my computer, but I am going to get and I can be able to hook it up and use it."" [Agent] ""Perfect. Yeah, you definitely will."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Oh, you mentioned a mobile line."" [Customer] ""Oh."" [Agent] ""Do you guys need a mobile line for the location?"" [Customer] ""What, what do you mean by that?"" [Agent] ""Like a cell phone?"" [Customer] ""Um, Uh, I do not know. I, I mean, I have a cellphone in my hands. I mean, I, I, what do you mean like"" [Agent] ""No, I am sorry I thought you said um, Verizon had offered you a like a cell phone plan I thought you needed a cell phone plan for a second."" [Customer] ""Oh no, they, oh, that was another, that was the other Verizon. There are two Verizons. One with the with the cellphone type thing and then there is files."" [Agent] ""Mm."" [Customer] ""There are two different ones but they are both Verizon, but they are not."" [Agent] ""Got you."" [Customer] ""Connected to each other somehow. So I could not even use the phone with files because they are not the same thing I guess Right, so you guys offer a mobile phones, is that what you are saying?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, we do offer the mobile phones, um yeah, like for example if you, if you sign up with one line, you get a $40 discount on your internet bill"" [Customer] ""Yeah, OK."" [Agent] ""Uh, one line is $45 monthly. You get unlimited talk, text, and data. You have an option of bringing over your own phone or you have an option of leasing a phone through us, so it just depends on the type of scenario that you are looking for."" [Customer] ""Oh What to think of is like if you know the the mobile phones were hooked up to. The phone so that if someone's standing outside, they can still talk like, you know, like a walkie talkie type thing"" [Agent] ""No, I see what you are saying, yeah, you know, like you would, you could do call forwarding and have like the calls forwarded to the cell phone, but it is not going to be like."" [Customer] ""Well, you know, well,"" [Agent] ""To where you could transfer a call to the mobile phone and like you said take it outside or something like that."" [Customer] ""Mhm. So I can see like a regular phone but it is mobile."" [Agent] ""Yeah, just a technically a regular cell phone."" [Customer] ""With an Oh, OK. All right. I will keep that in mind you know"" [Agent] ""Yeah, if anything, let us know and we will definitely get that set up for you."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Yeah, because you know we are, we are probably going to have to be mobile people you know, I do not All right, so, OK. I will talk to you more about that."" [Agent] ""Perfect so everything once again is all set for you."" [Customer] ""Just trying to figure it."" [Agent] ""Anything else we can do for you today?"" [Customer] ""OK. Um, no. Uh, yeah, let me say. Thank you so much."" [Agent] ""You are very welcome and once again thank you for choosing Optimum here at Optimum."" [Customer] ""So"" [Agent] ""You have a good one. I am sorry, go ahead."" [Customer] ""OK, oh, do you guys offer, one thing, do you guys offer like tech setups, like, do they offer that kind of thing like? Like, uh, tech, um, like learning platforms you like a tech person."" [Agent] ""Like technical support type of thing. Not like a learning platform."" [Customer] ""Like a person would just."" [Agent] ""But promotion does come with our built-in protection plan."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""So if you have any issues, technical issues at the location with devices not working properly or whatever the scenario may be from computers to laptops, printers we can troubleshoot those items for you. So it does come with the built-in protection plan, but not like um like a class type of scenario or anything like that a tech would um possibly come out to the location or troubleshoot it remotely over the phone."" [Customer] ""OK. OK, and also XX thing, do you like I know Verizon had offered um. Promotion of the business through some sort of search engine. They need like XX different, they, they, they um Provide you with like at least XX different search engines or something like that, your info, like once you get the website set up, I do not know how they said it, but. Um, they promote the business, businesses like that instead of you having to do that yourself and You know, shoot your information through Instagram or they just automatically. Push that through for you."" [Agent] ""Nothing per se like that, but we do offer certain things like, uh, for example, our pro Wi Fi access point. Let us say if you have that for guests that come in, want to log into the internet, or let us say if you have like, um, a lobby type of area or outside sitting area and people log into it or even just passing by, you would have to capture their email address or their telephone number for them to use your access point which would be free Wi Fi for them. You can also market to them once you capture that information."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So for example, you can send them emails if you have uh the phone number, then you can send them text messages. This is what we are offering this month flashal whatever this type of scenario may be you can advertise to those people like that. So every time someone is on it could show you also how many repeat people you have logging on to your Wi Fi. So if you see someone that is logged in X or X times in one week, but they are not enrolled or using your program or at the location, they might be just stopping by eating something from a local deli or something in the area and using the network you can advertise to them. So we do offer that with our pro Wi Fi."" [Customer] ""Mm."" [Agent] ""The pro Wi Fi itself is 39.99 monthly, uh, same thing, it is no contracts or anything like that with it. A lot of new businesses do find it helpful. But let us say once again if that is something after X month or X months you find out is not working for you or is not giving you the feedback you wanted from customer use with it then you can always take it off."" [Customer] ""Mm. Mhm."" [Agent] ""But it has a great analytics network that comes with it."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK, alright, so we just start out with just this and then I will see after that, you know."" [Agent] ""So say that part again."" [Customer] ""Uh, no, I said let me just start out with the, you know, just the phone and your internet and see what I you know"" [Agent] ""Yeah No, of course, as you grow, what else you might need down the line?"" [Customer] ""Right now I am just so clueless and so uh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah."" [Agent] ""I will send you an email."" [Customer] ""You guys, you know, you send information and stuff I could just read over like wow, this day off and this that I you know I. Yeah, you know, I could look into it like that so."" [Agent] ""Exactly, so I will send you an email with like a link to the pro Wi Fi access points so you can read up on it, see if that is something you might need in the future."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And if you are looking to expand or upgrade any services, you can always reply to that email, and I will give you a call and we will take it from there."" [Customer] ""OK. We will see them tomorrow and Wednesday between X and X."" [Agent] ""Perfect. Correct, and I am sorry, can you verify your email address for me one more time?"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Just want to make sure I have it right."" [Customer] ""Um, J.C Day XXXX@gmail.com."" [Agent] ""OK perfect so it was not CD days XXXX@gmail.com, just C days."" [Customer] ""J"" [Agent] ""J.

Alright, well everything is all set once again if anything changes for you with the date and time, just give us a call back and we will get it rescheduled for you."" [Customer] ""OK, thank you."" [Agent] ""You are welcome you have a good one."" [Customer] ""Appreciate it. OK. Bye. OK."" [Agent] ""Bye bye."" [Customer] ""You too. Bye."""

[Customer] ""You can put XXXX."" [Agent] ""OK. And then may I ask what kind of business this is, ma'am?"" [Customer] ""It is the floral store."" [Agent] ""Awesome. So you are going to be using the internet to order to place orders."" [Customer] ""Yeah, supplies, these orders."" [Agent] ""For your point of sales as well on that."" [Customer] ""Yes, yes, credit card machine."" [Agent] ""Credit card and then how many devices are you going to have hooked up to the Internet?"" [Customer] ""Hooked up to the internet, I believe, just a credit card, just a credit card machine, maybe a cellphone."" [Agent] ""OK, and are you going to be having any cameras here this location?"" [Customer] ""Cameras? not yet in the near future."" [Agent] ""I mean, because that would also probably require a high speed internet and then services that you are looking for for your business, is it internet invoice?"" [Customer] ""Um, internet and landline, that is the same."" [Agent] ""OK, so internet and a landline."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Uh. Bear with me. Let us see. And then in terms of the internet speed, like, uh, how fast because I believe, let us see this location is fiber capable, so we can actually even give you like a one gig connection here, bear with me just see, based on the things that you are stating."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""a look at the offers."" [Customer] ""This is. Well, no, I can not. I tried it all night. I I think I will go with the fiber one though."" [Agent] ""Yes, this address is fiber."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""We do not charge more for fiber, so fiber is available we would just give you fiber, um, because this address is fiber capable, which is good so you can get a fiber connection here"" [Customer] ""Oh."" [Agent] ""Bear with me, OK?"" [Customer] ""Yes. Mhm. You"" [Agent] ""And then did you uh need auto pay? Are you OK with auto pay because we quote uh prices with autopay as well. AutoPay gives you a $5 discount you can enroll yourself It is totally up to you."" [Customer] ""I will do that. I will do that soon."" [Agent] ""OK, so you will enroll in auto pay later."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Um, I just say gone."" [Agent] ""And then I know you are primarily interested in the business landline. Do you have like a mobile device that you currently use for business as well, ma'am?"" [Customer] ""Not right now."" [Agent] ""Because if you were to bundle your mobile with your business account, you could actually save up to $40 a month on your business account by switching over to our mobile. So even if it is something that you do not want to add now, you can add it in the future and get that, uh, discount."" [Customer] ""Um, OK, so."" [Agent] ""We offer unlimited voice and data plans as low as $45 a month. So it is unlimited talk and text then you save $40 a month on your business account Which is pretty good because the more products you have, you can, um, absolutely, again it is something you can add at any time so there is no pressure with adding that."" [Customer] ""OK, maybe in the near future. OK, yeah."" [Agent] ""I just want you to know what we have available and that it could save you some money. That makes sense."" [Customer] ""OK, yeah"" [Agent] ""And and then just bear with me we are almost out here, OK?"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Sorry I have a delay here."" [Customer] ""No problem. Oh No"" [Agent] ""So we can give you, ma'am, a X gigabyte speed that is X gigabyte up X gigabyte down that would be a fiber connection you are getting symmetrical speeds in both ways."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""That would also come with unlimited phones. So with the phone service, you get unlimited calls to anywhere in the US, Canada, as well as Puerto Rico. So you get all of your calling amenities at no extra cost."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""You would also get a connection back up with that. So say if there was an optimal outage, uh, you would not be without service in your business, OK, so it would be a failover."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""You would still be able to take credit cards, which is important, so that money always coming in. Your business and then you would also get premium protection."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""So if you needed even assist in setting up your point of sale, your cameras, it would all be included with that level of service and that would be like having your own personal geek squad you would be looking at $160 a month, ma'am, with a X year price guarantee."" [Customer] ""OK. XXX a month. Can you just break that down for me one more time?"" [Agent] ""Mhm. So what you would get with that is the sure."" [Customer] ""Like which"" [Agent] ""You get the, sure."" [Customer] ""Like, how much is the internet, how much is the landline like that."" [Agent] ""OK, so it is a bundle, um, so the sail over would be $30 and the protection would be $30 so it would actually be a bundle, but by having the more products you get more discounts. Does that make sense with the service, it would be a bundle package."" [Customer] ""Um, OK, yeah."" [Agent] ""And then there is, sure, sure, I am sorry, you go ahead."" [Customer] ""The, the second."" [Agent] ""I do not want to speak over what were you saying, ma'am?"" [Customer] ""Is the protection mandatory?"" [Agent] ""No, you can take off the protection and still just have the fell over if that is what you would like."" [Customer] ""A sale over you said?"" [Agent] ""Yes, like the connection back up so if you wanted to take off the protection you can add it later."" [Customer] ""Yeah, can we, uh, do that the protection for now?""

[Customer] ""For business."" [Agent] ""Right, but how many devices would you be connecting? The reason why I ask is we usually ask just to know what speed it is that you are going to need."" [Customer] ""OK. Um, I want to say around. X devices maybe."" [Agent] ""OK. Perfect. And do you need"" [Customer] ""That is not including a TV."" [Agent] ""OK, alright, are you going to be streaming on those TVs at all?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, oh, you mean like um, like streaming like Neflix, Hulu, stuff like that?"" [Agent] ""Oh Right, right, yeah."" [Customer] ""Yes, yes."" [Agent] ""OK, all right. Let us see what we can do for you here. OK, so it is a gig market what we have out there, so that means that you can go up to the gig speed, which would be the better speed and the recommended speed based on the devices that you are going to connect. Um, you did mention that you did have TVs. Did you want cable TV for those TVs?"" [Customer] ""Um, Yeah, yeah, we could do the cable, so the cable that I have on the residential plan it would get switched over to this."" [Agent] ""Mhm, no, so it would basically this would be its own thing. So if you have anything there then that would be on that account this would be on this account It depends, you know, we, we connect boxes to each of the TVs, so whatever the business TVs are going to be, that is where we would connect this one."" [Customer] ""OK, um. The TV is, does it include like all the regular channels or?"" [Agent] ""So the TV is going to include most of the uh news channels, sports channels, some of the movie channels, but it is not going to have the premier channels on the business side. The premier channels, I mean, um it is going to be HBO, Showtime stars, things of that sort."" [Customer] ""Right, um. I think I am going to leave off for now."" [Agent] ""OK. All right. So let us see what we can do here for you. OK, so what we can do for this one, we can give you the good speed internet with the one phone line. It already includes one phone line you can use it. You do not have to use it. It is up to you, but it is there and it is what gives you more savings in the bundle. Um, if we go with this one, you are looking at a monthly rate of XXX that is going to include your equipment, the phone line, it does include the XX hour IT support on the account and it does include our backup. So if the internet was to go down the backup would basically pick you back up so you are not left with nothing"" [Customer] ""Online for the XXX and for the X gigabyte, it was not coming to XXX, it was like only like XXX."" [Agent] ""What, what price are you looking at?"" [Customer] ""Um, well, I looked at the XXX MDS then I also looked at the X GB, so what is to come up to XXX"" [Agent] ""Mhm. OK, what were you getting on the pricing online? Let me see if I can match it here."" [Customer] ""I do not have a computer in front of me because I am like driving, but I just know it was around like 1:17, XXX, something like that."" [Agent] ""OK, let me see if I have another promotion for you bear with me, OK?"" [Customer] ""And then, oh, OK, wait, wait, wait, wait."" [Agent] ""Hold on, uh huh."" [Customer] ""Also, I was just on the line. I initially called in about the business Wi Fi, but they were like, oh do you want to set up the the mobile phone that comes with the Wi Fi and I just set that up with them and they were telling me it is about like it is like $3 for the Motorola phone and then $20 for the X. So was that not included in this or is that was that a whole separate thing that they just signed me up for?"" [Agent] ""So that is a mobile. If it is a business mobile, it it it is going to work to your benefit. So let us say if it is a business mobile, it would count for your $40 discount on your business account. So right now, let us say you did take the $175 plan, it is going to give, it is going to bring you, it is going to give you a $40 discount, it is going to bring you to $135 when it is with a gig."" [Customer] ""OK, so like what I just had the phone I just signed up for, is that not going to be included with like, well that is all included in this package?"" [Agent] ""That will be, that will be separate because if you signed up separately with it, that will be separate, um, but again it is going to benefit you because if you put it under this business name it is going to give you a $40 discount on this so in part it is going to have to do with this because it is going to give you that discount but it is its own, it would be its own separate bill."" [Customer] ""Oh, so you are saying it is better to keep it like that than to just do it under."" [Agent] ""What do you mean?"" [Customer] ""Cause you said with the Wi Fi, it already includes a mobile phone, right?"" [Agent] ""It does not, so it does not already include a mobile phone, no, no, no, it does not."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK, OK."" [Agent] ""It includes a phone line which is um the landline so that you can use for either a phone, a fax, or security alarm, whatever the case is, it is just what it gives you more savings, um, but going back to the offer that you did see online, let me just take one more look and see what I can do for you here so that we can try to match to what you saw online, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Hold on. OK, so what we can do, we can do it with the gig speed. You can still maintain with the phone line if we do that one and you do it with the auto pay, it would be 1:15."" [Customer] ""OK, wait, you just said phone line, but I thought you said it is not the full month. Oh, you were saying that the phone line."" [Agent] ""It is, it is a landline, it is a landline, yeah."" [Customer] ""OK, got you, got you, got you. Alright, OK, um, how much did you say it was again?"" [Agent] ""1:15 with the auto pay."" [Customer] ""XXX and that was with the X gigabyte or XXX of the."" [Agent] ""That is that would be with the one gig."" [Customer] ""OK. Um, and that is the, the fastest speed, right?"" [Agent] ""Yes, that would be the faster one. it is going to include your modem and equipment and it is also going to include that phone and again like I said, if you, you do have that mobile already, what you are going to end up paying with this one, is going to be. About $75 once they apply that credit for the mobile."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK, OK. Great, great, great. OK."" [Agent] ""You want to go with this one?"" [Customer] ""So, um, Yeah, how long will it take to set up cause I only have about XX minutes before I have to go to work right now, um.""

[Customer] ""When, when would, when would it take every month?"" [Agent] ""Um, so it is going to take XXX. It is with the taxes, it, it, well, once the XXXXX is what it is going to be with the taxes, um."" [Customer] ""No, but what day, what day every month?"" [Agent] ""I Oh, I, I would not be able to tell you that, so it would.

[Customer] ""It is uh each computer has its uh the way we function now is that we have each tablet with its own internet service."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""So what I want to do is cut that out. I want to just connecting one internet service but two different routers where it is like has no correlation to you get, you get what I am trying to do"" [Agent] ""Yeah, no, I definitely get so it comes with a different like uh IP address."" [Customer] ""Correct."" [Agent] ""Like whenever you sign in, so we are going to provide you with your first one. You can always purchase the second one and you do have the ability to put it on there. We also offer static IPs."" [Customer] ""What does that mean?"" [Agent] ""So a static IP is um where your static IP address like stays the same instead of constantly changing um so it is more or less a designated IP address and we have the ability to offer you up to X so you could put um a static IP on like one computer on another computer and another computer assign it to each one and so that whenever it kind of like searches like what you are saying like logging into Amazon or whatever it would see different IP addresses based off all of those devices."" [Customer] ""Uh, how does that, how would, how does that work? How, how does, uh, so if I connect to one computer onto under the internet, how does it differentiate, I mean, how do I differentiate them?"" [Agent] ""So in Yeah, so you get a special router to where in that router you are able to assign the static IPs to each device."" [Customer] ""Oh I mean I am going to have to purchase a second router"" [Agent] ""So, well, no, when you get static IPs with us, we bring you that special router, um, that you are able to assign all these static IPs to different devices, or you can purchase your own router so that you have to because we are going to provide you with your first one and then you can always purchase another one and attach it."" [Customer] ""Uh huh OK. OK, so now if I had with this router that you guys are providing me with, uh, I have I have up to X you are saying XXX static IPs"" [Agent] ""Mm, so we have the option to provide you X static IPs. If we were to set you up with the X static IPs, it would be an additional XX. So in total we would be looking at XXX for the total bill."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK. Uh huh, OK, fine. Let us, let us stick with one. Let us see how the, uh, oh, OK, so let us try the internet first, uh, before I jump if it is if you know, if I like it, uh, again, if I do not, if I, if because what happened with my place is that the internet sucked."" [Agent] ""OK Now sometimes that is because of speed because because you will go for like a lower speed because of the price point, um, like, like earlier I quoted you for our X gig internet that is our fastest speed it is going to be able to handle any devices, any uploads, anything, um, but you know as you go lower, of course the price is going to go lower but you are also like jeopardizing the speed and having issues issues like that."" [Customer] ""So with I and I, I think I got Optimum, and they, uh, it did not work good well with my original place so hopefully this time will work. Yeah Yeah. Yeah. Lower states Yeah."" [Agent] ""And so that is I would that is why I would recommend our XXX over their XXX they can give you and we are going to be giving you a better speed, a better service, and it can handle up to about XX devices so that will work great for you."" [Customer] ""Correct. Yeah. Is it, is it, uh, is it fiber fi, uh, files fiber optic, what do they call them?"" [Agent] ""And Um, so what Files is able to offer here is not fiber optic, it is hotspot. It is a XG network."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh. OK, but what you are, you are providing me is just regular internet, is that or?"" [Agent] ""We So this, uh, this is actually fiber at this location, so you would see a symmetrical upload and download speed."" [Customer] ""OK, so I am getting a fiber, uh, whatever. The faster, like the faster uh fiber, whatever they call it."" [Agent] ""Um, so you would be getting our XXX meg fiber."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""One more second."" [Agent] ""Were you able to find that tax ID?"" [Customer] ""Um, just give me a second, let me just look. I am looking for it so I have it."" [Agent] ""OK, take your time.

And I know you mentioned earlier that you were not wanting to do like uh you do not have any type of like business phone are you just using your personal device for your business?"" [Customer] ""Yeah"" [Agent] ""OK, because with you getting on our XXX meg Internet, we actually have some really great bundle deals whenever you bundle this with our Optimum mobile cell phone we are actually one of the cheapest providers of cell phone services right now We have got plans as low as just like $15 a month. How much are you paying for your cell phone?"" [Customer] ""I have no clue. It is also, it is all like pay. I am guessing XXX books, so like a whole family plan, and uh, I, I, I I do not know I have been with TMo for so many years. I do not know. I would not change."" [Agent] ""No I mean we are on the same, yeah we are on the same coverage as T-Mobile, but I mean like I said we can help you save some money and you get some additional discounts um with our XXX meg Internet after having our phones for XX days you would actually get a $20 discount bringing that down to just about $70 monthly."" [Customer] ""I do not see myself changing. Yeah. I have a question, would that, um. How about, what about tablets that have internet in it?"" [Agent] ""We will be able to bring over tablets as well, mhm."" [Customer] ""Would that cover that? Instead of the phone, because what I am going to do, because what I am doing, what happens is my I pay for my, uh, uh, unfortunately that it is done that way since I have a couple of lines with T-Mobile, I end up paying for the businesses, um, uh, tablets because it just comes from my, it comes directly from my bill and I, I am not going to calculate that."" [Agent] ""Hm Mhm."" [Customer] ""So I am wondering if I instead of transferring, um, instead of transferring, um, phones, I will transfer the tablet maybe would that work?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, that would definitely work."" [Customer] ""That that."" [Agent] ""You would still, you would still get that discount on that as well. Um, now with our tablet services right now they are running XX XXXX after taxes, and that would be, um, it comes with unlimited talk and text with XX gigs of data."" [Customer] ""Oh no, I get unlimited internet with my with it. I, no, do not pay off. It does not pay off for me because I am, I am paying if I am paying XXX and uh XX, I, I would say roughly from what I remember last week, probably XXX and it is like I have like X lines on there then the tablet service is is probably nothing, yeah"" [Agent] ""Mhm. Oh, OK, OK. Have, have you been with them for quite some time?"" [Customer] ""I would say over XX years."" [Agent] ""Oh yeah, then you are, you are definitely grandfathered in with them because early like I was looking at recently at their plans and one line was $120 so you are definitely got some great deals with them."" [Customer] ""Yeah. Yeah, yeah, no, I, I am not, I am paying like XXX bucks. I am, I, I, I, I could be, I could be off by like X or XX bucks, but, uh, because I, I remember seeing it on my credit, not on my credit card I mean my, uh, auto pay, uh, just vaguely just seeing something like that, but, uh, yeah, it is roughly around that place, yeah."" [Agent] ""Oh OK. Yeah, you must be grand grandfathered into something. I would love to see like if you are open to me seeing like what one of your bills are, I can send you over some like uh offers that we have and maybe you can see if something works for your business even if it is not like moving one of your numbers over maybe we can even just set you up a new number or something just so you can get those additional discounts yeah and then um."" [Customer] ""Yeah, maybe. Yeah, I appreciate that."" [Agent] ""Yeah, of course, I always like to save my customers as much money as possible. And I can get you installed tomorrow."" [Customer] ""Tomorrow is Thursday."" [Agent] ""I Yes sir, I have an XX to X. Are you available around that time?"" [Customer] ""Yeah"" [Agent] ""OK and."" [Customer] ""XX to X, yeah."" [Agent] ""Mhm and then since we are getting."" [Customer] ""And we just make sure before before we wrap things up, just make sure that uh fee for the installation is that we can get avoid that."" [Agent] ""Great minds think like Mike because that is what my next sentence was is that we did go ahead and uh credit that for you and so there will not be any type of installation."" [Customer] ""OK perfect."" [Agent] ""Yes, sir, and then did you have a card or a bank account you wanted to use for auto pay?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, can I add that later on?"" [Agent] ""You can, um, yeah, before the month is due you can always add that."" [Customer] ""Uh, before the month is due?"" [Agent] ""I just have to submit this without the discount, so it would be XX until you apply the autopay discount."" [Customer] ""Cool, cool, I just, uh, well because if the service works. No problem. I just want to make sure that the service works because I am again I had a very negative, uh, experience last time and of course, but I do not care"" [Agent] ""Oh, of course."" [Customer] ""I am paying the bill I am paying the bill Might as well just go to pay it and leave me alone, you know, but, uh, I just want to make sure that the service works."" [Agent] ""Yeah, yeah."" [Customer] ""That is all that is all I am concerned about."" [Agent] ""Of course, and like you can always have a peace of mind with like uh setting our services up because we do offer a XX day money back guarantee. So within those XX days it does not work for you, give us a call we will just, we will give you the money back that you have sent with us you are good to go"" [Customer] ""I appreciate it."" [Agent] ""Yeah, and then what is a good X digit access code I can put on your account for you?"" [Customer] ""OK. What is that, uh, what is that for?"" [Agent] ""Um, so any time you call in on the account we just want to verify that we are speaking with Mike we will ask that code"" [Customer] ""I am going to give you a code, but I am guaranteed to forget it, but by any chance what what would happen if I forget it?"" [Agent] ""Do you want to do something? If you forget it, we will just ask for the last four of your tax ID do you want to do something like really simple we can do XXXX"" [Customer] ""I am going to say that you do XXXX, but I know I am almost sorry and I am going to forget it."" [Agent] ""OK. The XXXX is the address you think that would, you would still think you would forget that?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, 100%. No, 100%."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""I would never, it would never come to mind. I use this code for some, some stupid stuff, uh, but, uh, that is why I am, I am, I am giving it, um, but, uh, let, let us see if I will remember that I, I know myself"" [Agent] ""OK. OK, oh, OK, well, that is OK."" [Customer] ""Um"" [Agent] ""Like I said, we can use the last four of the tax ID easy peasy. OK."" [Customer] ""Alright, yes, yes, OK.""

[Agent] ""Yep, well, I, I know how to pronounce Aquabog, so obviously I am local."" [Customer] ""I figured it is great because a lot of times I call, I am freaking talking with people. I feel like I am talking to Pakistan. I can not understand a word they are saying."" [Agent] ""Yeah That You know they have people all over."" [Customer] ""It is, it is really rough."" [Agent] ""OK, do you have the X digit access code that is on this account?"" [Customer] ""Yes, it is uh. XXXX."" [Agent] ""Excellent thank you very much. Alright, and let us work on getting this upgraded here. Is it a doctor's office?"" [Customer] ""No lawyer."" [Agent] ""Lawyer, OK, so I just so, OK, so."" [Customer] ""Maybe"" [Agent] ""OK, so when is busiest, how many devices are hooked up to the internet there?"" [Customer] ""Um, Really not many, um. It is like you got a computer in the office. We got X, you know, phones that we scan the internet from when we are lounging."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""And we have got X TVs that we stream. So that is where, that is a lot of where the issue comes from."" [Agent] ""Got you."" [Customer] ""It is getting the signal from the router, which is X years old, in the basement, up to, up to an extender which looks like it is freaking something from XXXX."" [Agent] ""Yeah"" [Customer] ""And then from the extender to, you know, a decent signal to the TV in the bedroom upstairs or even in the, even in the living room, sometimes it is just always buffering or."" [Agent] ""Yeah, well,"" [Customer] ""So, I think with a good extender and a, and a You, you know, new modem, that they will communicate better we should be fine It is, like I said, it is not, it is not terrible, but it is, it is lacking."" [Agent] ""Yeah You know, I, I think I know exactly what the issue is, is you have a very outdated internet speed, so you are at XXX megabits, so I mean really just the devices that you read off are probably right maxing out the bandwidth."" [Customer] ""It is very sluggish."" [Agent] ""It is uh for streaming things like it is very standard to be at the gig now um. So which it would be XXXX so we could do that we could add the pro Wi Fi as well and that that will work as uh perfect as you know getting every connectivity, everything, I think you are going to be uh. Yeah, yeah, that'll be perfect. Just bear with me one sec."" [Customer] ""Alright, my price is still the price will still be locked in at XXX, right?"" [Agent] ""So But there will be a change, uh, and I am going to, it should not be much. It should be something about uh probably around $59 because you are going, like I said, you are going up to actually no, hold on, it is actually going to be a little less, uh, it is going to be about $45. It is like I said, you go up to the gig and you are adding the pro Wi Fi, uh, and the pro Wi Fi acts as a second network too, so you actually can do a lot with that, you know, I mean you can, um, do you have, uh, like, do you like other people access the network as well?"" [Customer] ""No, it is just us in our house."" [Agent] ""OK, well, I was just saying because there is sometimes people they, they have that or if they have a a rent or something like that they let people access it, you know, this would be acting the second network, um."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, no, we do not have much activity on it."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""I think just with the pro I think just with the pro Wi Fi. And the and the swapping out the route will be sufficient."" [Agent] ""Well, that is what it is. I mean the pro it is, it is just adding the pro Wi Fi that is, uh you are basically getting the upgrade for free It is adding the pro Wi Fi because the pro Wi Fi is 39.99. Your difference of the bill is going to be 44.99. That is it. And this will be a XX year price, you know, same thing, no contracts."" [Customer] ""Well, they told me to swap out and get the extender and the new router does not cost anything."" [Agent] ""They do not really have this."" [Customer] ""I keep saying."" [Agent] ""Um, we do not really have an extent this, this is I mean, basically like I said, you are basically getting You are basically getting everything as as a wash, you know what I mean this you are upgrading from XXX to XXXX and your bill, like I said, is only changing for the cost of the pro Wi Fi because the pro Wi Fi is not free, so that is what I am saying the pro Wi Fi is XXXX, that is it."" [Customer] ""Is that 39.99 a month or XX sorry."" [Agent] ""Yes ma'am. Yeah, a month."" [Customer] ""It is a month?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, so."" [Customer] ""Alright, well, I do not want, I do not want to do that now they told me that you can switch it your price will stay the same It is always X."" [Agent] ""Yeah, they unfortunately, pro they definitely should not have told you that then that is fine. So we could still like get again yeah, we could still get the upgrade, alright, OK, and then hold on one second Yeah, so, so we could still upgrade you and get you to the gig. I am trying to see what we have here. Just bear with me one second."" [Customer] ""I do not need I just need a I need a new I need a new router modem and uh and um."" [Agent] ""I mean Well that is that is what this is. That is see, that is what this is. This is a new router modem combo, right this is, we do not even do the XXX speed you have anymore Like that is what I am saying that is how outdated it is. So just to do that, you know, like I said, it changes, gets you to the gig. It is $30 it is $35 difference a month. You do the auto pay's difference of $30. Do you have um mobile or tablets for the business?"" [Customer] ""Um, No, no, they are all landlines which are through Optimum."" [Agent] ""OK, yes, I, I see you have the X."" [Customer] ""And. Yeah, we have X landlines and internet throughout the."" [Agent] ""Yeah, well, we teamed up we teamed up with, uh, T-Mobile to use their networks along with ours"" [Customer] ""No."" [Agent] ""So for businesses, if you bundled a mobile or a tablet line, I can give you a $40 discount on the gig internet. And you can use the phone for whatever, you know what I mean, you do not have to buy a new phone if you have a phone that you know you just want to activate, you could do that as well, uh. Simply for businesses, you know if you add a line, you get the savings"" [Customer] ""Yeah, and you say that if we add a line that'll be. Minus the $49 a month for the router."" [Agent] ""It, it would be, it will give you a $40 discount on the gig into that price, yes. That is what we are doing for."" [Customer] ""I All right, well, I, I do not know if she wants to do that."" [Agent] ""That is what we we are coming over to Opera mobile."" [Customer] ""We just want to get a little bit of an increase in the internet."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Maybe we will change our motive in the future, but um."" [Agent] ""OK, that is fine. Well, you, you could leave yours. You could switch, you could add new whatever you want to do."" [Customer] ""Oh."" [Agent] ""But this way with this, there is also a XX day money back guarantee. So like that is what I suggest to everyone try this out. I with this upgrade. This is going to fix all your connectivity issues. You are not going to have any issues going forward."" [Customer] ""Yeah. Can I, what about he suggested upgrading just to XXX, he said, and get that router."" [Agent] ""Well, that the XXXs I mean, I, I am just going to be honest with you, this is the best bang for your buck That is, that is, that is what I am trying to, to give you here. If you upgrade to this, you get your, your connectivity, and this is still, you know, one of the best we offer so you are going to have not going to have issues if you upgrade to the XXX X months from now, you know you say, hey, you know what, I am going to need more You are going to have to do this all over again right now this is the promo you are going to get the new promo price for this one."" [Customer] ""Um, yeah, it is a big bang for the buck I do not need a big bang I just need the extender and the new router because this one's up."" [Agent] ""I mean we Well, we do not really have like a like an extender per se. The closest thing would be the pro Wi Fi, but let me, let me see what I could do here because if we go to the XXX that we will see what that does just to try and, you know, get you, I know listen, we live on Long Island Every everything's expensive. I want to try , you know, I want to try and help you every way I can, so just bear with me one sec"" [Customer] ""Yeah, I mean all the people I talked to said there would not be uh uh a fee charge for it."" [Agent] ""No, that is, I am, I am sorry that they, I am sorry that is not like I wish, I wish it unfortunately, but, uh, yep, I mean that that is it I mean what I was doing, I was waiving, uh, any installation fee, so I mean I was already doing that."" [Customer] ""It is"" [Agent] ""So let me get"" [Customer] ""I do not know. Maybe I will switch to T-Mobile. I it is a different story with different optimum so I do not know"" [Agent] ""And if you switch the team over you are going to switch right back."" [Customer] ""I talk about it."" [Agent] ""I am just going to save you the trouble because I mean I have been sitting there working with everyone, uh you know, switching people back from competitors all year so I would hate to see you have to do that all over again So just let me see what I could do, try and get you the best promo. The gig is really like I said, the best bang for your buck because you are already paying $290 you know, so your bill was only going to was going to change XX bucks you were going to get a significant upgrade So just give me one sec. OK, I want to make sure I got."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I I do not need too big of an upgrade with the speed. I just Need a new router modem. And an extender."" [Agent] ""OK, yeah, that is what I said they do not really do any extenders that is like, like for for business is not really much of the pro Wi Fi kind of access it we are ruling that out So I mean really what we could do. I am trying to get you the best the best I possibly can get here then then you do not have cameras or anything there, correct"" [Customer] ""Cameras? No."" [Agent] ""OK, make it sure."" [Customer] ""We, we do not have much. We just have one computer and one smart TV and"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""A couple of cell phones."" [Agent] ""Got you."" [Customer] ""But the equipment is so freaking old."" [Agent] ""Yeah, and that is why we need to get you new everything."" [Customer] ""She has Yeah."" [Agent] ""So if, if we upgrade you to the XXX, right, the $500 and with the, the business, the premier, you know, it is, it is a tech support, but it is also, uh, product protection, you know, that that we offer for businesses it is about $10,000 in coverage a year. The bill only changes $10 a month and then you go to the $500 so you are more than doubling what you have now and that should fix that and that is giving you new hardware and everything too."" [Customer] ""There is XXX and new hardware. What is new hardware?"" [Agent] ""That is the uh the the the modem router that is the you are getting new brand new equipment, you know, top and bottom, making sure everything's, you know, up to date. You are definitely better than, you know what you had from X years ago And the same thing X year, X year price uh price fix on that no contract, same thing."" [Customer] ""Um, And how much would it be a month for the internet?"" [Agent] ""So the whole, the whole thing together instead of the $290 you are paying it goes to XXX and I waived the installation fee."" [Customer] ""OK, and I will get a new router modem uh the the pro Wi Fi or whatever"" [Agent] ""Yeah. Now there is no pro Wi Fi with this you are probably not going to need it with with what you are telling me how, how big is the entire, the, the space you are trying to cover? It is just a house you said?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, it is a house and like the technician like he told me he said, he said it is a pretty big house, so if you are trying to get serviced on the 2nd floor and your router is in the basement, he said, you know, you, you need to have the extender, so."" [Agent] ""Might be able to move."" [Customer] ""I do not have."" [Agent] ""If they move the router to the main floor, you know, that might help too, so I mean I can make a note on there because I mean that could fix a lot of it because I mean I I said I am I am out by you I have um a two story mother daughter and mine mine's on the other end of the house I have no issues So it was simply my basement."" [Customer] ""OK The one, the one thing is, um, I do not think. We will be able to switch the router location because in the basement where the router is, there is also like I do not know what you call them switches there is all these switches with X lines running up to the outlets in her office"" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Which, which you know, she never even uses the outlets, I do not think hardwire, um, except for maybe one more than the extender , so, um, I do not think switching the router location is going to"" [Agent] ""And so stop fees."" [Customer] ""What we want to do."" [Agent] ""Well this is going to give, I mean you are going to have a stronger signal anyways so like I said, what you had was a very small bandwidth and very outdated so this is going to be better across the the board and if Texas is there and deems that you need some sort of extender, you know, they will work with it too. Well this, well this right now, I mean again you are, you are more than doubling what you have. I think this is going to fix everything you are saying and if for some reason it does not and you do need to upgrade to the gig you can because there is no contracts so you are free to do all that. So I can actually have a tech there on the 12th, that is uh next Monday."" [Customer] ""All right, but the one thing, um, I am wondering about you said he can get us some type of extender. If it is not working out."" [Agent] ""Poss. No, that is what I am saying. Then we would have to get something like a pro. We do not really have an extender for business like that is what I am saying. It is not and it is not much you could always set up like your own kind of extender, but I do not really think um. You know, like I said, we do not really have them for business I am going to make a note like I am, I am notating the uh the file and everything you are saying, you know, the, uh So the routers is. And you said it is the basement correct? So that is it. So the tech and the tech could do that, you know, I am going to be available the day of installation and everything too, so they are going to make sure you, you are going to have a stronger signal. It is going to work throughout the house much better. I mean you do not have concrete walls, correct?"" [Customer] ""Um, Only in the basement where the router is, but"" [Agent] ""Yeah, like, so typically in the basement that is what I am saying like if they do."" [Customer] ""Signal goes up."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so you, so you should be fine. Like I guess the only time like, uh, you ever go to like a restaurant something like they had like the big cement walls sometimes they run into issues that also depends on, you know the square footage, you know what I mean So I think you are going to be fine with this. Now and I have XX to X available on the 12th."" [Customer] ""Um, on May 12th."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so that is next Monday."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So"" [Customer] ""Can you send me uh Do you send me a reminder or anything or no?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, you are going to get you are going to get an email from Optimum. They are going to do that. They are going to email again and confirm everything and it is uh NY counselor at Hotmail.com is the email we have."" [Customer] ""Yeah, what about tax, do you do text?"" [Agent] ""Uh, I do not know if they text. I do not know it. I know that the tech will call beforehand. The tech, the tech calls when they are on their way you get, you will get multiple emails prior"" [Customer] ""On this number. OK, I want it on this number though to call because."" [Agent] ""The XXX-XXX. I am sorry I put the wrong I put I am I am sorry this is XXX"" [Customer] ""Yeah, XXX."" [Agent] ""XX,XXX,XXX"" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""OK, yeah, so, OK, so, so recap, you are getting the the upgrading for the XXX, the $500 with the product protection difference of $10 a month. I waived any installation fee. Tech is coming Monday the 12th, XX to X is the window. About XX minutes half an hour before arrival, the tech's going to call XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""Alright, payment, uh, I made a note that it routers in the basement we will go from there So keep an eye out for the NY counselor email and they will make, uh, they will have everything there to confirm the appointment and everything, and you will be good to go."" [Customer] ""OK, um, one other question, can you tell me if I did? When we get the pro Wi Fi but. What deal you can get me on that."" [Agent] ""It would, it would be another 39.99 a month for the pro Wi Fi."" [Customer] ""Uh Yeah. Huh. And where does that get located? That is like an extender, you put it like in the middle floor and it"" [Agent] ""Yeah, they, they would, uh, well, the tech would probably, you know, he would, you know, analyze the area and tell, OK, it is probably best if he did it here, you know, that type of deal."" [Customer] ""Yeah, right. OK. Um, All right. Well, you know we will try this out Swing the new router may help. It does not need much. It just needs a little bit more."" [Agent] ""This, this should definitely do the job then it is because you are you are already doing that with the XXX. This this will do the job and and I think you will be very happy with it."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""All right."" [Customer] ""Oh, thanks so."" [Agent] ""You have a great day."" [Customer] ""Thanks."" [Agent] ""Bye bye."" [Customer] ""Yes, you too. Bye."""

[Agent] ""It is $100 and I am willing to waive that for you. OK, now it is XXX with the auto pay."" [Customer] ""Because because we rather. Yeah, we would rather use you guys."" [Agent] ""OK OK, so the sales price then today because in order for me and the system automatically gives you the $5 discount and it is not something that I have control of, um, when we put a card when you do enroll in auto pay, when you put a card on bank or bank account on file, it automatically deducts the $5."" [Customer] ""Well, oh, we did not set up our bank account yet, so I can not give you the bank information uh. Sure right. Uh huh. It automatically OK OK OK.""

[Agent] ""Perfect, just how I would have spelled it if I may kindly."" [Customer] ""Hey, that is a beautiful thing."" [Agent] ""Can not prove me wrong now cause yeah you just spell it, guess what? I will spell it right."" [Customer] ""I, I Yeah"" [Agent] ""If I may, please, what is the X digit access code for the account?"" [Customer] ""Oh, that is a great question. Let me look."" [Agent] ""And then"" [Customer] ""Your access OK And XXX X."" [Agent] ""Is that one that you just entered just to confirm."" [Customer] ""I just entered that yeah I do not think we have one maybe we did yeah"" [Agent] ""OK, let me re it it is OK. No problem. I will refresh your account. Yeah, when you go into the access code it does not give you what it is, it just lets you reset it so there you go."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I saw that."" [Agent] ""Perfect. So now it is 12:17. I appreciate that. Um, you need a static IP. OK, let me take a look at the account and then we will go from there."" [Customer] ""Yes. I"" [Agent] ""OK, um, we have X static IP for XX, X static IPs for XX, the visit is XXXX. You tell me how many you actually need in case you want to do the X for XX , um, I will be happy to schedule you"" [Customer] ""We will do the X for XX just in case we need."" [Agent] ""OK, perfect, thank you."" [Customer] ""X"" [Agent] ""Yeah, no problem. And let us see. Was there anything else that was required? any TV service, any additional phone numbers, anything at all that I could help during this visit?"" [Customer] ""Uh, No, no, I think we are good."" [Agent] ""OK, I do see that you have our gig speed of service which is great and. Just checking the calendar and finishing up the we are going to let you know how quickly we can get somebody out there for you."" [Customer] ""Perfect."" [Agent] ""May I ask what you are doing for mobile service?"" [Customer] ""Uh, we have T-Mobile I think"" [Agent] ""OK, I mean that is a good thing if you do."" [Customer] ""That is not my department."" [Agent] ""That is OK."" [Customer] ""Yeah, that is not my department."" [Agent] ""That is a really good thing if you do. The reason why I ask is because Optimum does offer Optimum Mo and we use T-Mobile power in order to run our service, um, with cellular service, although it may not be your department with cellular service, we could offer up to XX business lines."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Um, we could do an unlimited line for basically $47 including. Um, the taxes and you would get $40 off on your internet service. So there is a cell phone that you want to test out or anything like that just to see how it works with us, literally $7 gets you a unlimited, um, text, call and XX gigs of premium data on your service, test it out, see how it works, and it could potentially add additional savings, um, because you know our lines could be as low as $25."" [Customer] ""And you said it was that you said that was uh XXXX."" [Agent] ""So with our unlimited service, it is $45 a line. Once you have X lines or more, the price goes down to $30."" [Customer] ""OK, alright, I will."" [Agent] ""And once you have X lines or more, it goes down to $25."" [Customer] ""So"" [Agent] ""Even with having just one line, you get $40 off on your internet service. So It is um it is a, it is a really pretty picture."" [Customer] ""OK, I will um, I am going to have to check with Yeah, that is a really pretty picture."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Uh, I will have to chat with the people that run that account for us, but uh, no, that is definitely something we will look into."" [Agent] ""Yeah. Not a problem. The good thing is is that if you do happen to have T-Mobile, you know what the coverage is like, so you would not be sacrificing anything exactly, and you have no contracts and no cancellation charges with our Optimum mobile service, so you know that is, yeah, so the way that it kind of works out $47 because it is $45.02 dollars in taxes, $40 off on the internet service, get to test out that first line for $7."" [Customer] ""It is not going to be a change, yeah. I like that."" [Agent] ""Um, but even if you go into like deeper numbers, $60 for two lines, you still get $40 off the internet service. It is like less than $25 for two mobile lines, so you know it is a great way to go ahead and do business."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Um, the phone number on the account ends in XXXX. Are you familiar with that number?"" [Customer] ""Uh, yeah, that is our, uh, that is our property manager."" [Agent] ""OK, so that is the phone number the technician is going to call before he gets there to confirm that he is on his way."" [Customer] ""That is, that is perfect."" [Agent] ""The next day that I have available, the next day that I have available for the installation would be on Tuesday the 8th. I have an X to XX."" [Customer] ""Uh, X to XX works works great."" [Agent] ""You open at X. Are you OK with that just to make sure?"" [Customer] ""Oh yeah, yeah, we are in, yeah, someone's in here at X."" [Agent] ""OK. He said someone is not me, but someone's in someone's in that."" [Customer] ""Uh It is not me someone's there"" [Agent] ""No problem. So you are good to go."" [Customer] ""I am not I am still at the gym then."" [Agent] ""Oh, OK, good stuff, keeping it healthy, um, so just to confirm your appointment is in the system for XXXX between the hours of X to XX $4695 for the visit, $30 additional monthly for the service, and um, let me provide you my email address just in case. If they do decide to move forward with the mobile service, I would be honored to assist."" [Customer] ""Yeah Perfect."" [Agent] ""My email address, I am going to say it, spell it save it. It is Sandra. Garcia at optimum.com. So that is S A N D R A G A R C I A at. I am sorry, at OPTI.com. So Sandra. Garcia at optimum.com.""

Call150,"[Agent] ""I will be tucked away in the corner just like going to my kid. Our connection"" [Customer] ""Yeah. Hello?"" [Agent] ""Thank you for calling Optimum Business Home of Optimum Mobile.

[Agent] ""Yeah, yeah."" [Customer] ""Yes, uh, account number is XXXXXXXXXXXXXX."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Oh perfect thank you very much for that. We are going to go ahead and take a look at your account XXXXX. OK, and this is for uh Union Smiles Family Dentistry at XXXX Park Avenue?"" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""Excellent. OK, so, um. It will be $20 a month for just one static IP I, I will let you know that Optimum typically recommends that you get a block of X there is two reasons why The first reason is instead of $20 for one static IP address, it is $30.10 dollars extra for X blocks of IP addresses. Now you might only need one right now. But in the future if you have a need for another static IP address, what ends up happening is you lose the one that you have for the new X for the next one to appear. So I just want to try to avoid the situation in the future where you might need to have another IP address and you lose the one that you have. So you know it is, it is up to you. I, I, I prefer to give you the block of X so you have that as your business scales in the future."" [Customer] ""Got it. What, what is the difference between having X and X IP addresses?"" [Agent] ""So, um, sometimes businesses are like, you know we just need one static IP for security cameras, right And they start there and then as the business grows they end up, um, maybe it is a cash only business and they decide, you know what, we want some credit card machines so they get some credit card machines and then their their IT team says, hey, you, you need a static IP for this too and then they are like, OK, so then they call us and say hey we need to get another static IP address, but since they only had one. They lose that one so we can get them the X that they need to begin with so to avoid headaches down the line, I recommend, you know, you get the block of X so you have them in your back pocket for the future and they and they do not expire they are they are there forever."" [Customer] ""And they are $30 a month."" [Agent] ""Yes, yes, sir, absolutely, and I could waive the installation for you as well."" [Customer] ""I Uh, I am sorry, what?"" [Agent] ""Um, we will be waiving the installation fee. I am looking at your account. It is an excellent standing. Um, you have been a customer of ours now since January. No, no headaches there, um, so yeah, I, you know I would, I would be willing to, to waive the install fee for the static as well We will just see something, mhm."" [Customer] ""Got you. Uh, so someone would have to come and install it. Is that, is that what it is?"" [Agent] ""Uh, yes, so the technician would come, uh he would install the static IP and then as soon as he is finished, uh he would provide that information to, you know, whoever's there to, to receive him on site"" [Customer] ""Got you."" [Agent] ""So we have that here."" [Customer] ""Um, OK, and"" [Agent] ""Yeah, and I could waive that installation fee. It is 46.95, um, but I, I will save you the money. It is not a problem. You are, you are a great customer of ours."" [Customer] ""Thank you. Um, so it is, um, All right, let us um Let us go ahead and do, so my, my current bill is $200 a month I believe."" [Agent] ""Right Yes sir, yes, yeah, actually your, your bill was, let me do this real quick look you get my calculator, so I want to include taxes and whatnot, so we have, uh, XXX XX minus XX. OK, hold on Yes sir, you know what, let me, uh, let me clean up the account because there is, there is older codes in here.

[Agent] ""OK, cool, and Nina, uh, just because you are aware of the technician arriving, do you mind if I leave you as a point of contact when when they call ahead when they are on their way?"" [Customer] ""Of course."" [Agent] ""Perfect. And they could reach you at XXX-XXX-XXXX, right?"" [Customer] ""Sure. Yeah, yeah."" [Agent] ""OK perfect just so you know um your account is eligible for Optimum mobile services, uh, which means that whether it is the phone lines that are on your account, your phone line, uh, family, friends, any other employees, if you set up Optimum Mobile, you get up to $40 discount on your internet bill here and that does not expire that lasts for the life of that promotion. Um, excuse me, the, the life of how long that is linked together and the phone lines will be when it is all said and done like $5 a month because the phone lines are usually $25 a month for the mobile and you can keep your phone, you can keep your phone numbers of that $25.20 dollars will come off as a credit on your internet bill So like let us say, let us say the internet bill was was $100 and you put up two lines that you bring over. That $100 drops to $60 and then it is just $5.05 dollars for the other ones. So just something to consider if you would like I can send you an email with more information."" [Customer] ""That would be amazing."" [Agent] ""Yes, I bought, yeah."" [Customer] ""So if, if I sign up for X phone lines right now, X cell phones, right? You are saying X cell phones?"" [Agent] ""Mhm. Yeah, if you if like you have the two phones right now, I can go ahead and link that with your internet account I could save you $40 you know, right, right away It, it may take a couple billing cycles to see, but when you get the, when you get the bill in the mail, you will see the mobile discount itemized, so it will it will be like right there in front of you to, to make sure that you are getting the discount."" [Customer] ""So if I, so right now I am T-Mobile, I would transfer to you guys."" [Agent] ""Yeah, and it is funny you mentioned that, Nina because we, we use the T-Mobile network and we also use that in combination with our optimum hotspots and we have nationwide coverage, yeah, international calls."" [Customer] ""Really?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, I was just actually talking to another business owner, uh, about this, um, and they are actually going to have, uh, they are a landscaping company, so they have people out in the field. So they are, their supervisors that are with, uh, I think they are with Verizon if I remember correctly, they are going to be bringing their numbers over to Optimum, all X of them."" [Customer] ""So if, if I am paying $100 for internet I add two lines My total bill, instead of $100 would be like $70 a month."" [Agent] ""That is correct, nailed it nailed it on the head, mhm."" [Customer] ""So that it would actually go down if I transfer lines."" [Agent] ""Yes, yes, and you do not, you will still stay, you will still stay within the T-Mobile network you will not be paying their prices You are, you are going to see a significant savings you get to keep your phone , and the phone numbers"" [Customer] ""Could you please send me an email with that information?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, send it over right now. Let me just, um, because the email that I have here, uh, I think it is you. I just want to make sure it is spelled correctly. We have Mina, that is M as in Mary, I as in igloo, N as in Nancy, A as in apple. Uh It looks like the number X and then Isaac A S A A C at gmail.com."" [Customer] ""You mean I S A A T?"" [Agent] ""That is correct, yes. M I N A, the number X I S A A C at gmail.com."" [Customer] ""Yeah, that is it."" [Agent] ""OK, perfect.

And I wanted to ask you if I have not been using the internet service at the business because we did not open yet, does Optum offer any discounts for that or like any um anything for that because we have not used it in a couple or X or X months."" [Agent] ""Mm. Uh, you know what?"" [Customer] ""And we are probably not going to be using it for the coming X months either."" [Agent] ""Um, you know, let me, yeah, let me get this template. I am going to get the mobile email information to you really quick, and then what I will do is, um, I will get you over to our billing department for that, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK. Sure."" [Agent] ""We need all copy. Put that here. And thank you for bringing that up so I could take care of that for you."" [Customer] ""Oh, thank you."" [Agent] ""OK, make sure you get the $40 discount. So let us say, let us say because you can have up to XX phone lines linked um, I could do X at a time but you could have up to XX but let us say, let us say you have X, right Uh, the first two phone lines will get you that $40 discount."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So the first two phone lines will just be $5 each per month and then the remaining X will just be $25 a month and if they do not have to be employees, um, I have had business owners say, you know what, I am on a. Family plan with Sprint. I might as well just bring my entire family plan over to Optimum Mobile because you know they still reap the benefit no matter what. Like we do not have stipulations on who can have the phone. Our only requirement is that the account is linked with your business account. That is all."" [Customer] ""And everything is unlimited the data and and everything"" [Agent] ""Yeah, correct. I mean, you know, there is, there is different plans, right? So this one is going to be, um, all our plans are unlimited talk, unlimited text you get high speed data Uh, this one will have X gigabytes of high speed data after that you, you can still use the data instead of just XG It just, it becomes XG. There is really like no difference, right?"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""um."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Yeah, I am a heavy data user like heavy, uh, my daughter uses her iPad when we drive she uses my phone as a hotspot I have not had any issues whatsoever."" [Customer] ""OK, oh wow."" [Agent] ""Mhm yeah."" [Customer] ""And so it would actually, it would, so it would actually um the the total bill would actually be less if I transfer a couple of phone lines at least."" [Agent] ""Much, much less, much less, yeah. Mhm."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Alright, so I am sending that here and OK, I just sent it. Mina, do you have access to that email right now, like push notifications on your phone?"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""OK, perfect.

[Agent] ""Did you want to go ahead and set that up today?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, that is fine."" [Agent] ""Perfect.

OK cool so um right now the number you are calling from is your cell phone?"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""OK, who do you currently have right now?"" [Customer] ""Uh, AT&T."" [Agent] ""Got you. The reason why I asked is because we do offer cell phone services in this area. We are using the T-Mobile towers. What is amazing about this offer there is no contracts with our cell phone either Um, so you can keep the same phone number. You can keep the same, uh, device. I do have an unlimited plan, talk, text, and internet for $45. What makes that deal sweet is that you will get a $40 credit on your internet bill as long as you have that cell phone service with us, you will have that $40 discount So if we do the math, it is only a $5 difference."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I would say, uh, not now, yeah, not now."" [Agent] ""What is holding you back from spending just $5 on cell phone service?"" [Customer] ""I do not Yeah, I just thought I was too a shit."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Not yet."" [Agent] ""No worries. Alright, uh, as soon as I got, can I get out there this Friday between XX and X?"" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""This Friday alright. One moment. I am going to leave your cell phone number the XXXX on file So as a courtesy to have him call you, it is not a mandatory call it is a courtesy call but of course you will be there have somebody there between XX and X, right?"" [Customer] ""OK. Yeah I be"" [Agent] ""Perfect, I am going to tell him to call first. I am going to notate it for you so this Friday between XX and X, and then here just a moment we will take care of the payment"" [Customer] ""I"" [Agent] ""Uh total is XXX. The way that breaks down is a $100 installation and first month of service at the $155. Then I will get you set up on auto pay and paperless."" [Customer] ""So, is there a way to uh I have a different card coming in the mail. I am going to use a different one. Is there a way to wait till Friday or Thursday when it arrives?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, if you want to"" [Customer] ""Can I call that in like Thursday morning?"" [Agent] ""Absolutely, yeah, if you want to call back in Thursday morning, Jason and um say hey, I have, I have opinion installation and I want to make the payment and set up auto pay and paperless, they will get that squared away."" [Customer] ""Let us do that. I will do that before that. OK, yeah, I want to use the other debit card coming right."" [Agent] ""And Got you. So I am going to also, uh, so my supervisor gave me a $10 credit on the installation, so it is actually technically $90 and not $100. I am going to notate that so whenever you call in you can bring it up $90 installation first month of service $1155. That is what you will be paying total, um, together the $155 and the $90"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So it comes out to be 2:45. And then they will apply the the extra $10 discount for you on the installation and then move forward with the autopay and paperless and they can go to your email address."" [Customer] ""OK"" [Agent] ""Let me go back to my dates. Alright, just get everything updated showing that as of right now we are going to get everything billed if you decide to not make the payment and wait for the bill to arrive, Jason, um, everything would say $160 on there. You get that $5 discount once you actually set up the autopay and paperless."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I can call him in."" [Agent] ""Cool, cool, alright, and I will send everything to you via email. Was there anything else I can help you with today, sir?"" [Customer] ""No, that is it."" [Agent] ""Alright, again my name is Danny. Thank you so much for choosing Alpha. You have a great day.

I am not in a world of hurtful, we can move it to a different day."" [Agent] ""Well I say just, you know, for your own time having to send someone out multiple times, you know what I mean, if you get it all done at once."" [Customer] ""Yeah.

[Customer] ""And, and it probably never should have been done that way we probably just, we are idiots That was, they are, they are quite old, so."" [Agent] ""Yeah, well, sometimes, you know, you get it started, but now you know you do this and then all of those accounts will become write offs too, so it actually a lot of benefits to it. Also business takes precedence with optimum. So yeah, you just, uh, let me know when you get that email."" [Customer] ""OK I go back cra.""

[Customer] ""But how much is it? uh, you know, I can not afford so much money."" [Agent] ""Alright, let me give you the difference between XXX and XGB. So if we do a XXX megabytes which will increase your speed by XXX megabytes that would bring your total monthly bill to 179.99 a month if we do the X gig speed. The X gig speed would be 269.99 a month."" [Customer] ""Wow. No way. And how much do I paying now?"" [Agent] ""Um,"" [Customer] ""I see now it is XXX, right?"" [Agent] ""Let me see. XXX XX."" [Customer] ""So my plan is XXX. For XXX."" [Agent] ""One Uh-huh."" [Customer] ""Static IP is $20. So it is a discount of XXX. Right.""

[Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""There is expanders for that."" [Customer] ""He said that this is the way to do it."" [Agent] ""This is, this is what you do if your internet is, is slow. So if you, if you have XXX megabytes."" [Customer] ""My internet is not slow."" [Agent] ""So if you have XXX megabytes internet and your internet is not working like it is not, it is slow basically, yeah, if you are having issues with the range of the internet, it is too far away some something is too far away for you to connect you need the pro Wi Fi"" [Customer] ""And in the building.""

[Customer] ""$140.00  Where are you putting it? you put it next to the router or?"" [Agent] ""Uh, I am not really sure. Sometimes it has to go on the ceiling. Sometimes if it is like floors, it depends. Um, I have never hooked one up. I just work internally over the phone, um, but this is, this is what you need if you are trying to extend the range of the Internet speed wise it is only if it is slow."" [Customer] ""Interesting. Everybody's telling me something else."" [Agent] ""Well, you can, you can look it up online what the pro Wi Fi does. Pro Wi Fi it is an extender that is like for example used in hotels, um, used in coffee shops and bigger places like warehouses."" [Customer] ""That is what that is why he told me it is, it is not a standard. It is a different network that you offer for hotel."" [Agent] ""Yeah It is not a different network. You have the option for filtering, which is an additional $10 a month where your clients or guests can hook up to their own individual network, but, but it is the, the primary usage is an extender.""

[Agent] ""That Well, let me, let me quote you what our main promotion is right now, see how you feel about it, and we can go from there, um well I am trying to build this"" [Customer] ""That is why we are baby steps on getting this house, um, in order. We have to get it to code and regulation for Airbnb. OK."" [Agent] ""So with our main promotion, um, it is our X gig special. Um, it used to be a lot more pricier than what it is now, but we have got a lot of discounts this month for it. It has your Wi Fi modem router combination. It is a X year promotion there is absolutely no contracts The modem can, um, handle the speed of X gig obviously, um, it will have bandwidth for your cell phones, your cameras. Um, if you plan on having an Airbnb in the future, it, you do not have to worry about it lagging or buffering this promotion will put you at $155 a month, um, if you, if you do not sign up for autopay $150 if you do sign up for autopay"" [Customer] ""OK. OK. Let me see, oh."" [Agent] ""And then what I can do since you are just not starting out I can still take care of the install fee for you. I got you covered with that plan if you do decide to go with it."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And next."" [Customer] ""So that is Oh hold on."" [Agent] ""Yeah, take your time. You are fine. I am still trying to build this."" [Customer] ""That is on a business and then what if it was just a residential, would it be cheaper?"" [Agent] ""Um, residential promotions are a little bit, um, less than business, like XX to $15 less, um you have more perks when you have a business account You get commercial grade equipment, top priority and built in security for the internet. OK."" [Customer] ""OK, well, maybe I should just go residential right now before, cause I am, um, after I talked to this with my business partner so I just wanted to see because her dad was having a hard time because he was entering everything into the um"" [Agent] ""Mm."" [Customer] ""Computer and it was saying that there is no service there but I know that there can be service there because there was service there last month."" [Agent] ""Let me check the address online to see what it gives. Give me one second. State Highway. You hear me talking to myself Do not you judge me, all right Do not you judge me."" [Customer] ""That is OK."" [Agent] ""XX and Carlota, California. Check availability. I got that same error that you did, so let me place you on a super brief hold. Give me one second, OK? You still there with me?"" [Customer] ""OK, no problem."" [Agent] ""OK, give me one second. OK, thank you for holding. I apologize about the wait. Um, so I was able to, um, speak to, to my lead, um, just to see if we can try to like get the price around the same rate as residential. I had to try to find an address near you though, um, because it would not let me see what it would be, um, for the X gig online at that address."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""So I had to like plug in something different."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""It looks like it will be roughly $7 a month with the residential. But with the X gig for commercial, what I can do is I can get the price down to $80 a month um and you get a $200 I do not know that is what the phone line you get free install um it is a X year promotion, no contracts, um, and if you need to upgrade or add on phone lines or anything like that, you always can."" [Customer] ""OK. OK. That sounds better, XX a month."" [Agent] ""OK, um."" [Customer] ""Come on, that sounds a lot better."" [Agent] ""Like you got me working. I do not like it cause I am having to find addresses online."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I appreciate it. Yeah, I know. Well, it is hard because right where I live, you can not find, you can find my address, but I can not get things shipped to my house, like Amazon or anything because They say that it is not registered with the postal service."" [Agent] ""Yeah, I, I, I saw it."" [Customer] ""But it is crock fit we all have PO boxes, so"" [Agent] ""I, I. Well, once you said that your, your, um, your billing address like a PO box, like, mm."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Alright, so what I would have to do is I have to escalate this up to my dispatch team and see what dates we have available. So I will quote you a date for now if we can get something sooner, I will let you know How soon were you needing this though?"" [Customer] ""Um, you know, we can, you can get back to me in the next week we can figure something out"" [Agent] ""OK OK, uh, because I can reserve it for the 14th for now and if we have something sooner I can let you know the 14th between X to XX a.m. Does that work for you if we can not get something sooner?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, and do I have to pay it now or can I pay it?"" [Agent] ""No. And that is another great thing with, with this with business you do not have to pay up front."" [Customer] ""Then OK."" [Agent] ""Um, I know with residential they do ask that you pay up front, but with business we do not, um we install making notes right now"" [Customer] ""Oh, my phone is ringing, sorry.""

And how can I help you today, Sean?"" [Customer] ""Yep, uh, we had an optimum, um, service rep out yesterday because we were having, uh, uh an issue with, uh, uh One of our wireless internet um matters and I guess an access point, and he said, uh. That we should call um. Optimum sales and let them know that our access point is the Cisco and it is I guess obsolete and it should be replaced with our ruckus um. And uh that there is also a modem that is being used as a surfboard there and that that needs to be replaced too um."" [Agent] ""OK"" [Customer] ""I do not know what that all means. I am not a technology person, but I wrote it down."" [Agent] ""And they came out yesterday, is that correct?"" [Customer] ""That is correct."" [Agent] ""And just to check in, are you, were you guys having problems before the technician came out?"" [Customer] ""Uh, yes."" [Agent] ""And what was going on with the equipment? Are you seeing a slowdown?"" [Customer] ""Uh, so I guess, um, we have X modems there each one is static X were, were wireless, uh, each handling kind of different, um, um, aspects of the club, uh, and, um, we were noticing that I guess the the public Wi Fi, um"" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""Was either uh slow and or like not working uh and then we traced that back to um. Uh, the technician, uh, was able to trace that back to that access point, um, uh, which he said was a Cisco, uh. Uh Wi Fi access point, uh, and he said that like they do not even make them anymore uh and that it should be replaced with the ruckus, um, I do not know if that is a brand name or a or a type of equipment, um, and that was being fed by."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""Uh, a surfboard, um, which I. Uh"" [Agent] ""And that is what gives you that access to the public Wi Fi."" [Customer] ""I guess was an Right."" [Agent] ""OK, and now with that that is what stopped working for you guys."" [Customer] ""Uh, uh, right, he said it was really old and antiquated."" [Agent] ""Yeah, because I see you guys have the previous indoor Wi Fi. Now just to see in that area, how uh how large is it?"" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""Is it over XXXX square feet?"" [Customer] ""Um, no, I would say it is about, uh. Maybe XX ft, uh, I mean, we will say XXX ft by XX ft, so, uh. I guess it is like XXXX square feet, right?"" [Agent] ""OK. And then in that area you just have like a guest public Wi Fi set up."" [Customer] ""Correct. Yup. Um And we noticed, I think uh like our our uh ring doorbell was attached to that also and that stopped working. I think that is what triggered um. You know that that it was not working, uh, and he had said that you know that, uh, you know, not to connect the ring to that because it is, you know, uh, a very slow system it it would need more I guess, uh."" [Agent] ""Yeah and you guys were alerted."" [Customer] ""Capacity for lack of a better term."" [Agent] ""And And at the moment you guys definitely do have a good internet speed. It is just with that equipment with that indoor access point, you are correct it is inadequate at this time. Now we will bring you guys out the updated pro Wi Fi access point and with that too, it has a little bit more features than what you guys have currently."" [Customer] ""Right. OK."" [Agent] ""I am not sure if you guys had anything set up through it. I can not see on my side. But with the new equipment they will bring you, you can either set up an access point with a splash page. You can set it up however you like to customize it, even if you wanted to throttle the Internet that is used on that access point."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""You guys can say I only want XXX to go to the public Wi Fi. The rest of my equipment gets that XXX megabytes per second. Therefore, at least that public Wi Fi is not slowing you guys down."" [Customer] ""Got it. OK"" [Agent] ""And they will show you how to access all of that at least you guys have all of the information."" [Customer] ""OK, great."" [Agent] ""And then since it is just the one area they cover XXXX square feet so we will just bring you one access point."" [Customer] ""OK, right, because I think we only have the one access point now."" [Agent] ""And that is perfect."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""And other than that with that access point, how is everything else running here for you guys?"" [Customer] ""Everything else is good because we do have um we do have uh like a static internet uh I think through you guys also uh uh and that is fine uh and our other Wi Fi um uh. Which I guess is the UV uh modem and that that is working fine."" [Agent] ""Yeah, perfect, because I see we have the X additional modems."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""And even to let you guys know at any point you are eligible here for Optimal Mobile. Do you guys have any type of cell phones on site?"" [Customer] ""We do not, we only have a landline, um, that is sufficient, um, you know, for receiving calls at the club."" [Agent] ""And then any time you guys are eligible for that cell phone service you guys even save $40 off of the bill so you guys get a good promo here."" [Customer] ""OK, uh, I do not think they want to do that at the moment just because uh, uh, we do not, we do not use it."" [Agent] ""And at any point you guys are eligible here what I am going to do in Bridgeport, I am going to try to get you the soonest date I can get a tech out there to bring you that new equipment What are you guys typically here?"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Is that just Monday through Friday?"" [Customer] ""Um, so typically there is nobody there, um, so if we could, if I could like make an appointment, uh, and I can arrange somebody to be there, uh, at that. Um, like I could do like, I do not know if there is anything available next Monday or next I do not know if I can get there Monday, like next Wednesday by any chance I hate to think that you."" [Agent] ""No, no, you are OK. I am going to see."" [Customer] ""And we are like a volunteer organization so so."" [Agent] ""OK, so you guys have, we are going to definitely going to schedule it with you, and I will give you like a X hour time window and they will call you XX minutes prior."" [Customer] ""That is fine. Yeah."" [Agent] ""I will be right back with you here Sean. I am just going to get you an exact time and date, bring you that equipment we will go over everything"" [Customer] ""Perfect thanks so much."" [Agent] ""You are welcome. Now, actually, just in case if we get disconnected, is that XXX-XXX-XXXX?"" [Customer] ""Uh, yep, that is my cell phone number that is the best number."" [Agent] ""Perfect, so I will be right back with you there."" [Customer] ""Thanks so much."" [Agent] ""You are welcome. Alright perfect so thank you for holding with me here.""

[Agent] ""And that day I have X time slots, so I either have from X to XXXX to X, or X to X."" [Customer] ""Can I do XX to X?"" [Agent] ""And then just in case, who can I call XX minutes prior is that this number?"" [Customer] ""That is this number, yep."" [Agent] ""And I am going to put you in the notes and they will take out did they take out the previous equipment or did they leave it?"" [Customer] ""They left it, it is still there."" [Agent] ""Their last name. OK, perfect, because they will take out the previous equipment and they will replace it with the newer now they did call it the ruckus, but on your like physical um promotion you will see it is called pro Wi Fi. That is what gives you guys the public Wi Fi access as you know you are never in a contract."" [Customer] ""OK"" [Agent] ""You guys can always upgrade, downgrade any time with the equipment with that access point, everything in total before tax XXXXX. And typically to get it up and running there is a one time fee of $99 but since we are just swapping out the equipment for you guys it is just a one time tech fee of $59 to get everything up and running."" [Customer] ""OK great and they will replace that old surfboard also."" [Agent] ""Yes, they will make sure that they replace everything and even take out the previous modem with that as well."" [Customer] ""Got it. OK perfect."" [Agent] ""And just in case to make sure this gets sent over to the proper place, is that their finance at is that nutmeg curing.com?"" [Customer] ""Yes, that is correct."" [Agent] ""I will send everything there about XX to XX minutes you will see everything in writing."" [Customer] ""OK, thanks so much for your help.""

[Customer] ""Oh Yeah."" [Agent] ""So all those laptops crash and they deem it that, you know, they need to be replaced, they will cover up to $10,000 worth of equipment a year."" [Customer] ""OK, and how much is that?"" [Agent] ""That one's uh that was $40 a month and then we also have the emergency connection back up that we rolled out this year."" [Customer] ""You think that."" [Agent] ""That is a device that if the internet drops, uh, or there is an outage in the area or anything like that, this device will kick in and keep everything up and running like your vital, uh, you know, point of sale things like that, so you are not going to be, you know, missing out on sales or anything if you have a customer there or anything."" [Customer] ""Yeah, oK."" [Agent] ""So we will put that yes"" [Customer] ""Um, and, and what is that well."" [Agent] ""That one and that one's XX, so basically the gig internet with the phone, the the emergency connection back up and the premier product protection is only XXX. So and that is everything and that is good for two years that uh. That promo price no contract, same thing."" [Customer] ""And then, and then after X after X years it goes up."" [Agent] ""It does, but with Optimum also, if, if you have a good payment history, they are always, they are fantastic with working with customers as long as you pay on time, they will give you an, you know what I mean they always work with you."" [Customer] ""OK, alright, so is that the is that the best you can do now?"" [Agent] ""It is been"" [Customer] ""Uh, XXX, can you do like XXX, XXX?"" [Agent] ""The only way I mean if we, the only way to do that is to like one I am definitely not going to sacrifice your speed because you are already having uh issues there because that means they have the lower speed you need the higher speed. I mean the only thing we could do is if we remove the product protection I could bring, I could probably get that down another couple bucks hold on."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""That said, yeah, I can get you down if we do XXX if we just get the lower on the product protection."" [Customer] ""For the protection, uh, what is that protecting?"" [Agent] ""Like that. That that is basically everything like so if you are say the shop gets struck by lightning, you know your point of sale, your computers, your TVs or everything are fraud, all that stuff's covered So it is more like an like an insurance policy as well."" [Customer] ""OK, yeah, you know what, let us do it. OK."" [Agent] ""So we can leave that so that puts you at XXX and the same thing there is no, there is no contracts so you know what I mean, say your business goes viral, you need to upgrade, you could do that as well."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Alright, so we will do that. Let me just hurry up and get the."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Because they have the previous one scheduled to disconnect the 19th so you have service. I do not want you to have any real interruption in service so I want to make sure this is the transition as possible"" [Customer] ""Yeah. Yes, thank you."" [Agent] ""Alright, one second. For Alright, just give me one second then what I am going to do, I am going to email you as well just so I know you have my contact. And then that is the best way to get a hold of me for this or any of your business accounts then you will not have to call you can simply email me I will be your guy to take care of all your business accounts for you"" [Customer] ""OK. You are sending that to the service as well, right?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, so service email yeah."" [Customer] ""Service at from Flora."" [Agent] ""OK"" [Customer] ""Alright, just that way I will let the ladies know they can look at it."" [Agent] ""Yep, and then now it is best on the day of install to have the tech contact XXX-XXX-XXXXXX, right?"" [Customer] ""Yes sir."" [Agent] ""Even if it is not you there as long as it is the range range for someone to have there."" [Customer] ""That is going to be OK, as long as it is like business hours, uh, Monday through Friday I think we should be OK"" [Agent] ""Yeah, we should yeah so I am going to check right now because I am trying to see if I can get, get you in for tomorrow because they have the disconnect."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, I, I would say the sooner the better, yeah, because, because we do want to start where she is crashing now and she wants to, she wants to do the secure network and if we wait too long, then it is like, OK, we are getting these people in, we are using the old stuff, yeah, yeah, we want to do it as soon as possible."" [Agent] ""Yeah, I am I am going to see Oh, that is right. I am good thank you, thank you for mentioning that. I do have if I have to, you want to add the static IP for the cameras, that is the point. I got to add that back in. Thank you for mentioning I was, I was just, I was going over my notes I just noticed that we, we missed the static IP That is what you need to"" [Customer] ""The static IP will give up the a secure network, right?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, yeah, the static IP is what gives you the secure and that one's XX bucks."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Yeah, but I, I, I."" [Customer] ""So what we are back at XXX now?"" [Agent] ""Now we are at XXX. Yes, it goes down another $5 once you do auto pay."" [Customer] ""Oh Um, Who may have the laptop that she wants to, she wants to purchase a laptop so just in case she can not come into the office she can do designs in the house"" [Agent] ""Now my other question is you have T-Mobile Do you have any other business, business mobile or tablets? Well, I could tell you if."" [Customer] ""So we may need that."" [Agent] ""Add a tablet line if you add a tablet line or another mobile line, I can give you a $40 discount on the Internet price. Because you have to get"" [Customer] ""Yeah"" [Agent] ""So that would bring you down XX bucks, right?"" [Customer] ""Uh, Yeah, I do not know because I, I know I got to get her phone. I got to get her phone either attached to my T-Mobile business account I may have to open her own account with the existing number she has"" [Agent] ""Yeah. Well Well, that, that if you could do if you could bring your device, you do not have to get a new phone, but if you put it this way, you add the line, you get the $40 discount."" [Customer] ""Yeah, and then how much would the line be a month?"" [Agent] ""Well, it depends. The most popular plan is the $45.01 because it is unlimited and it comes with XXGB of premium data. But if this phone's always going to be at Wi Fi, they have plans as low as $15 a month. So it really depends on how you are using the phone."" [Customer] ""Well this this is going to be her phone. She is going to be walking around with it everywhere she goes, uh, because a lot of, a lot of clients call her she, she does a lot of measurements out in the field, so"" [Agent] ""OK, so then, OK, so if you are looking at rolling. Yeah OK, yeah, then, then the $45 unlimited plan is, is the most popular and, and that is the other thing we work off the T-Mobile networks now as well, so you are already getting the same er along with the optimum hotspots so you get the hotspots plus the T-Mobile network."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So especially in a tri-state area where."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So, alright, so let me just give you what what I can get for the install day because I am if I can, I am trying to see if I can get you in for tomorrow."" [Customer] ""OK, OK."" [Agent] ""So I just have to do the recap so the X gig internet with the one phone, the premier product protection with the emergency connection bathtub with the static IP is $200 even go down to $195 when you do the auto pay, the one time installation of a $100 fee rolled into the bill. And right now I am trying to get the tech to come tomorrow between XX to X, uh, and about a half an hour before they would call XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Customer] ""Sounds good. XX to X, that is perfect."" [Agent] ""Alright so it will let me do that right now."" [Customer] ""Someone will be there."" [Agent] ""Alright, so right now we got you all set come tomorrow, right, between XX to X is the window, so they are they are going to call about a half an hour before."" [Customer] ""OK.""

OK, so as far as the services I do see here that you had our internet service, including the modem, the router, so you are advising me that that is all you need this is a great time for you if you needed to go ahead and add a phone number to the location and the shop"" [Customer] ""Mhm. Mhm."" [Agent] ""This is a great time because what I have what I get to do at this time, um, to thank you for being a valued customer is that I get to reset your promotion. So basically you had a promotion for a certain amount of time now that I am able to go ahead and put the order again at the new address that order gets to be basically reset. So basically your promotion was going to end, let me tell you when your promotion was going to end. Your promotion was going to end um in March of XXXX. Now I get to give you another two years of promotions, and now it is going to end in May of XXXX. So you know you get another two year promotion on the service without any contracts or cancellation charges, OK?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, but I do not need to add no phone service. I am good with what I have."" [Agent] ""OK, so what are you doing for phone service for the location if you do not mind me asking please?"" [Customer] ""We have cloud phones so we are able to be fine with it."" [Agent] ""Uh, you have the cloud, got you, got you, got you."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""OK, no problem, and you do not want to go ahead and port those phone numbers over to Optimum because we can go ahead and give you great deals on it. Like each line is $40 the first one you get for $25 so there is definitely a way of getting um some amazing pricing structures within the location Is that something that you may want to consider doing at this time?"" [Customer] ""If it is not broken, I am not fixing it, it is just fine the way it."" [Agent] ""Understood, understood. Alrighty then, so as far as the services are concerned, um, you get another X years of promotion. The monthly rate, um, including the $5 discount for autopay and paperless would be $100."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, I would take just the installation which is $100 and then the."" [Customer] ""I was not paying $100 before."" [Agent] ""Uh, let me go ahead and take a look at the monthly rate that you had before in just a few moments, and I appreciate your patience. Because what we do is that we reset your promotion so that you get a new customer promotion with the current rates, but it lasts a longer time. So if you had let us say a specific promotion that was given to you back in XXXX in XXXX. Now basically you get the promotion that is available in XXXX, but it lasts until XXXX, which at the end of the day is a better deal overall because if you were to keep, let us say that promotion and you were not moving, then in March of XXXX, then it would go up to its regular pricing structure which would be more than $100. So at this point, you know, you are actually end up on the positive side of things. I see the monthly rate here. OK, so yeah, that was uh probably uh enough, you know, a specific promotion that was given to you back in March of last year. So basically when I move you over I can put."" [Customer] ""XX."" [Agent] ""Sorry, I do not know if you can hear me with the background."" [Customer] ""Yeah, mhm."" [Agent] ""Let me know if you can hear me. You can hear me? OK, perfect."" [Customer] ""I can hear you now. Yes."" [Agent] ""Beautiful. Thank you so much. So basically, when you move to the new location, it is no longer going to be regular price after March of XXXX. It will be that promotion at $100 until um until May of XXXX so you end up saving a lot more money than the little uh difference in pricing than the small difference in pricing structure Let me go ahead and see how quickly we can get somebody out there for you if this is OK."" [Customer] ""No, um, it is $100? No, I am not. I thought that is a one time activity. I had a break. I need to tell my This is not what I started with."" [Agent] ""No, I understand."" [Customer] ""I did not that with what."" [Agent] ""What you have, you have at your current location at XXX Hudson Turnpike."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So if you were to stay at this location, then you will have that promotion until March of next year."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""And then it goes to its regular pricing structure. Let me tell you what the regular pricing structure is in just a couple of seconds. No, it is. It would be XXX, which would be the regular pricing structure. So basically when you move you have to put you into the new account number because when you move it is a new address so now we have the opportunity to go up."" [Customer] ""But My current monthly charges is $75 right now."" [Agent] ""Correct. And if you decide to when."" [Customer] ""So why do I want to go up to $100?"" [Agent] ""Well, it is not that you would want to go up to $100 or anything like that. It is just that that is the current promotion that we go ahead and have right now."" [Customer] ""OK, I am going to hold out on it."" [Agent] ""It is $100 including the X."" [Customer] ""I, I am not going to set it up. I am going to check my order option because it do not make no sense."" [Agent] ""Well, I mean, keep in mind that I unfortunately, I can not go ahead and move you with those current rates at this time. If you would like, I can go ahead and speak to my superior if you would like to go ahead and have, give me just a few moments to see, because though that that promotion is not a promotion that exists anymore."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""It is like going to a store with something that you purchased last year and you want to purchase it again, but you are using last year's coupon. Unfortunately, the, the coupon will not scan. So I unfortunately."" [Customer] ""But I am, I still, yeah, I still, you know, I still have the, I am just moving the service you can find out from them if they are still going to give me the same price, I will do it, but if not, I do not want it."" [Agent] ""Exactly. Exactly. I will be happy to go. Understood, so bear with me just a few moments."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Let me go ahead and speak to my supervisor because at this point I do not have any other options to go ahead and provide you."" [Customer] ""Oh OK. Yeah OK."" [Agent] ""I am going to place you on hold for just a few moments I appreciate your patience"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""I am just going to bring this up to their information. Thank you. Thank you so much for holding for me. I really appreciate your patience and allowing me to reach out to my supervisor. The best that he was able to go ahead and do based on the information he gave me was to go ahead and give him one time installation and no charge because that was also something that you had also asked for. So I brought that up to his attention, so he said that he would go ahead and do that as a one-time courtesy and no charge for the transfer of the services, and the price would be $85 and that is for another X years. So you will actually end up getting a promotion for maybe 3.5, almost X and change years as opposed to X years. If this is OK with you, I would greatly appreciate it."" [Customer] ""So now it is going to be $85."" [Agent] ""Yeah, XXXX and you can actually bring that down to $80 if you ever want to do auto pay and paperless, because if you want to do autopay and paperless, it brings down the price $5 more, so you can bring it down to $8005. So once again, you get a no charge installation."" [Customer] ""I did the I did the XX, yeah."" [Agent] ""Thank you so much. So once again you have no charge installation and um that is another X years of promotion. Can you tell me what day you would like to have us in um at the location so that I can um check the calendar please?"" [Customer] ""Um, what is the earliest? It will be, it will be here Thursday. It will be here Friday I think"" [Agent] ""OK, we can do Thursday. We could, we could do Thursday X to XX if that is OK with you."" [Customer] ""OK. You did that is fine.""

[Agent] ""Understood."" [Customer] ""I do not want to talk about it."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Let us stick to this and get this done and done. The early that day.""

Call172,"[Agent] ""Thank you for calling Optimum Business now offering Optimum Mobile. My name is Marcos. How can I assist?"" [Customer] ""Uh hi Marcos. My name is Dianehiev, and uh I got transferred to you because I was calling about the issues that I had with the Wi Fi, and apparently I found that I had the fiber option that I could get a fiber to fix the kind of those problems that I had. So and I had a few questions about getting a fiber."" [Agent] ""Yeah of course what are your questions?"" [Customer] ""Uh, I want to know the price difference and uh what exactly it is going to be better if I get a fiber. Cause I, right now I have a X gigabyte, and the problem that I called about it was the packet loss. It would be the packet loss and the business that I own is the gaming lounge, which is like uh people come and play the video games online, multiplayer or whatever, whatever. And uh if there is going to be any issue with the Wi Fi, it is a really problem for me. And recently, I, I have been having a problem like in the week, maybe X times. Like, uh, they bring your pocket glass often."" [Agent] ""How many devices are you using? Because I, I am sure, I am sure you know gaming requires a lot of bandwidth"" [Customer] ""Uh, Yeah."" [Agent] ""You know, if, I, I will give you an example. If it is just me at my home or me in my apartment, Uh, you know, I, I will, I will be gaming and I will have my, you know, maybe cameras, a smart TV, and that is it, you know, that would be a gig right there."" [Customer] ""Yeah. Right."" [Agent] ""But if you have multiple consoles, yeah, one gig is just not enough."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah. Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um Let me take a look."" [Customer] ""Oh, yeah. I, I, I asked that question in the beginning when I was getting the X gigabyte and they said it is more than enough, to be honest."" [Agent] ""Uh huh yeah so."" [Customer] ""Uh, sorry, can you give me a second? I am sorry can you give me a second"" [Agent] ""Yeah, Yeah, yeah, go ahead."" [Customer] ""I, I am getting a call. X minute. I am sorry."" [Agent] ""Yeah. Mhm. I"" [Customer] ""Sorry, yeah, yeah, sorry, I just got a cold."" [Agent] ""No worries. Um, so yeah, how many consoles would you say you have?"" [Customer] ""And that is pretty, that is a lot. I have XX computers, uh, X consoles, and the camera, and yeah, that is all."" [Agent] ""Oh Yeah, you know a gig, a gig can handle a lot"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I would say comfortably."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""You would sit in a good position if you had about maybe XX, XX computers, it would work perfectly, right?"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""After, you know, XX, XX, and, you know, the console, that is when you are really pushing the limits of the bandwidth, where there might be moments where you have a full lounge of people gaming, that is probably where you are noticing that it is struggling, right?"" [Customer] ""Yeah. Mm. Yeah."" [Agent] ""Fiber, of course, is going"" [Customer] ""No, that is, that is the uh, that is the part where I was the issue, but the thing is it was happening when it was only like, only X devices that were using like the X pieces."" [Agent] ""Oh wow."" [Customer] ""But then when it was getting busy, I had no issues, so it was, it was like randomly."" [Agent] ""Oh, that is weird."" [Customer] ""It was getting like in the morning when, yeah, that, that, that is the thing that was weird because there was like a packet but it is not about the speed, the speed is like uh it is stable. It is just the packet loss just uploading and the down it is like uh sending the packet, that is the issue I had. And I thought maybe it was maybe too many people are using it, but it happened when it was only XGs, so that is why I was thinking, I do not know."" [Agent] ""Mhm"" [Customer] ""But I mean as long as if I, if you are offering the fiber, it is going to be better than whatever is better for me to be honest, I just do not need an issue with the Wi Fi."" [Agent] ""Yeah, uh, well, you, as you may know, fiber is much better, um, it is going to be a whole new installation."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""You will get new equipment. It is no contract month to month, just how you are calling in, you know, we can make those changes, right?"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, if you were to do X gigabyte of fiber with, I see you have a number here, you will be at XXX."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Yeah, and I wanted to move the number also, but that is, that is the thing. I want to know the number and that yeah."" [Agent] ""So Yeah, so you will be at XXX with the number without the number you will be at XXX. So you are, you are really paying $15 for that number, OK?"" [Customer] ""Mm. Yeah. OK, then uh with the"" [Agent] ""But that, that, that, that would be the price. I will give you an example of what X gigs is X gigs is available in your area."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I am sure you will not have no issues with that, but that is about XXX."" [Customer] ""XXX. X, I see."" [Agent] ""Yeah, for X gigabytes of download and upload."" [Customer] ""I see. Uh, look, right now, the, I asked this question again. The right now the download, the speed is showing me the X gigabyte the upload is showing me the XX MBs"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""I mean, yeah, is it supposed to be like this or is it supposed to be showing the XGB?"" [Agent] ""Yep Yeah, yep, X."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK."" [Agent] ""No, no, XX is your maximum upload on coax. What you have right now is X gig down, XX up."" [Customer] ""Oh, I see."" [Agent] ""So you, you are getting what you are paying for. So if you switch to fiber, you will get X gig down, X gig up."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK. Mhm."" [Agent] ""That is what fiber is."" [Customer] ""Oh, I see."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Fiber is symmetrical download, upload."" [Customer] ""Oh, Oh, OK, then. I think I am going to get the XGB uh fiber, the XXX, you said, yeah, XXX."" [Agent] ""Uh, yeah, with the number it is Yeah, XXX with the phone number."" [Customer] ""OK, yeah, and I just want to remove the phone number and just say XXX digit and also the before that they transferred you to me. I mean they, I mean I got transferred to you and they already made an appointment for a technician to come and solve the issue with the package lost and since I am getting fiber, is it possible to get it today or actually I, I am going to have to find."" [Agent] ""No, that, that technician, that technician that is scheduled for today, that technician is uh. Basically a trouble call. They are, they go to fix a problem."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""They are not going to install fiber."" [Customer] ""Oh, I see."" [Agent] ""Fiber, we have designated technicians just for fiber installation. So I, I do not think I could get a technician to do it today, but definitely this week, I mean, today's Tuesday, you will have it before the weekends."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK, so, is it possible to get it on the the Tomorrow is also not possible, right? I am not sure is it."" [Agent] ""I could find out. I mean, I, I could really find out for you if you give me a couple of minutes. The only thing is that I am in the sales department."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I do not have a way to remove that number."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""The only way you can remove the number is by speaking to a retention specialist, but since you have me, what you could do is I could place the order for the gig, schedule it, and then you can just always call us back, Hey, can you remove that number and they will remove it for you."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Mhm."" [Agent] ""But I do not have a way to, yeah, if that is OK with you, we will, we will process it like that."" [Customer] ""OK, yeah, do not worry about it then, OK. Yeah, that is OK."" [Agent] ""It will be for XXX, but of course whenever you call, it will drop to like X, probably XXX."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""OK, um, let me find out when I can have a technician for you, but before I get started, do you know your access code to your account?""

[Agent] ""Thank you, you got it. OK, so, um, Mr. Khan, I wanted to ask you um, as far as things go with the POS systems, do you find yourself adding any more, uh, POS systems or, or cameras to your location Just calling you with me? Let me just see here."" [Customer] ""Yeah, uh Um, no, it is going to be X point of sale systems."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""And the Camera system."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Yeah will not be expanding point of sale maybe later down the line, but. No, I do not think so."" [Agent] ""OK, well, either way I just want to let you know that um with regard to your service we do have um the one gig in your area that is going to be the fastest internet so that is going to support your POS systems uh that is also going to support your cameras also it is going to come with a fail over the failover is uh it is like a generator like a backup only without the huge generator backup equipment."" [Customer] ""I"" [Agent] ""So in retail spaces we do not want POS systems to go down. We want people to be able to process transactions, especially with their phones and things of that nature. So you are going to have to fail over it is going to allow you to maintain internet and phone services even if there is a downtime. Telephone pole if it is, you know, if it is too hot in the summer, if it is too cold in the winter, you will still be able to maintain services for up to X hours. You are going to get a um this is business, so everything's going to be professionally set up. You are going to get a new gateway a new router, a new modem the tech is going to set up that X gig service Uh, it also is going to come with the static IP which is going to uh make sure that your cameras are communicating directly with the IP system, um in this way there is no lag or latency Uh, also this comes with a roll over line, uh, that is a not a mobile, uh, but that is a landline, so people use that for an alarm system or fax, um, and that is totally up to you. It is, it does come bundled into this promotion. Now keep in mind, although, um, you are going to be adding optimum equipment, your services and your products do come with support and protection. So not only does it of course cover all your optimum devices but any eligible devices. So say you get a big screen TV for your office or anything like that, keep in mind that if anything happens to that, whether it is a POS system a camera, any eligible device, instead of you going out and have to purchase something new, make sure you follow up with us directly to just see if if your devices are covered Um, now everything as I said, comes bundled in it will be itemized and you can review and make any changes you like, um, I am showing here. Not sure when you wanted to have services installed, uh, but you would be at XXX even, uh, there is a one time install of XXXXX. There is no contract there is no payment due today or to the tech Everything would be on a prorated bill. Let me see here Now it looks like as soon as we can get out to you we are pretty booked I can get someone out to you Thursday morning or Friday if that works for you."" [Customer] ""I think it is XXX is too much for me right now. It is a new business so I am really trying to keep everything as low as possible So I am trying to just get like, you know the basic service"" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Uh, what is, what do you have that is, but, you know, just internet and just phone."" [Agent] ""Yeah Well, that is my thing is that I want to be able to do that. I just want to make sure I am able to cover all the POS systems you did say you are not going to be adding any more cameras and at least for a little bit, right"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""OK, alright, so let me just see because I am, let me see here I think I can give you. The lower tier one second. OK, so I do have a promo code. I just want to see if it is, it looks like it expired, but I, I believe it is going to let me utilize it. Just allow me one second. I will be right back. OK, so it did work for me. What I was able to do is I was able to do what you said. You are just looking for the Internet and phone, so you are going to get the Internet, uh, X gig with, uh, fail over with that phone. Uh, you will be at $135 even. That is even without auto pay. If you got auto pay, I give you a $5 discount we also have a promotion with Optimum Business Mobile um, now for you, um, do you have, um, a business, a business line, a business mobile?"" [Customer] ""No, I do not. I, I want a business line that is going to be in the store, but not like a mobile phone."" [Agent] ""Well, yeah, that is what you are going to have. Alright, well that is what you are going to have I am going to."" [Customer] ""So that is already in the XXX a month."" [Agent] ""Go ahead, I am sorry."" [Customer] ""What, what is that? That is one gig internet? That is a phone?"" [Agent] ""Now that is the that is the optionality if you are going to go with the landline it is going to be a couple more bunks if you are going to go with the mobile, uh, it will give you an additional discount, but let me add the uh landline to it. Let me see. I thought it was on there one second here. OK, so. Alright, so with the repackage promo with the phone and the internet, uh, failover, it is going to be $160 even, um, with auto pay would be XXX, um, and the installation, there is a one time installation of $100. Let us see here."" [Customer] ""So right now this include one route you guys what what do you install? You install a router a thing"" [Agent] ""So you are going to get everything so you are going to get a gateway router modem the tech is going to install everything so it is going to set up the connectivity uh for your POS systems, uh, for your cameras it is going to be set up with the gateway the router, the modem, uh, everything is going to be, uh, set up"" [Customer] ""Modem Is there a monthly charge for the equipment or is that already?"" [Agent] ""Nope, so we do not charge you for the, uh no, we do not charge you the, the equipment"" [Customer] ""Or not Yeah."" [Agent] ""Uh, the equipment is included in this bundle and the that is why the installation is just one time. We just charge you one time for the tech to come by and professionally set everything up you will be good to go Uh, there is no contract you can. Upgrade or make changes at any time and as your account manager I just ask that you email me directly so you do not have to call in if you need anything at all, even if it is not in my department, whether it is billing, whether it is technical support, just email me I will get you over there what I will do is I will send you a test email um you know if and when we finish up so this way you can you know you know how to reach me directly"" [Customer] ""Yeah. I am going to need something lower though. XXX is still too much."" [Agent] ""So you, the thing that"" [Customer] ""Honestly, I was thinking I mean I saw you guys were doing."" [Agent] ""Go ahead."" [Customer] ""The XXX meg Internet."" [Agent] ""The only thing is is that I do not, I do not think that that is sufficient for what you have because you have cameras you have POS systems"" [Customer] ""How much would that be?"" [Agent] ""Now if you have like one or the other, it, it would be possible. So I, you know, if you want the XXX, I can give you that. I just do not think that it, it is the best bet for you, uh, because of the POS systems and the camera systems you want. Customers to be able to complete transactions and if you have an issue with your POS system or they have an issue with their connectivity, especially with people using phones, people are just going to walk out. They are not going to wait on line um, you know, if you are having issues with the POS so I would rather, you know you keep the gig Um, versus the XXX, I just do not think the XXX is sufficient I mean you are the boss"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""If you want XXX, I will give it to you you can upgrade later on I just do not think it is sufficient for your set up unless this is like a really, really, really small space."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I mean, I want to have two routers set up so I want to I have a base the office is in the basement"" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""There is a basement space there is a opera level I am for it. Some have the internet, you know, set up on the the ground floor That is where the cameras and all the systems need. I am out of the office with the computer I am in basement, so I am going to need a second router Down there. How does that look?"" [Agent] ""So so that is what."" [Customer] ""I is there a charge for that?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, so they are going to charge you for that. What I would strongly recommend is that you keep it as is with the one gig we set it up and then you will be able to utilize it um with the cameras and if you are with your office. Now if you determine because again I am your manager I I check in with you every couple of weeks, you know, however your schedule permits it. If you determine that you need more, then we can certainly add another one in there, but the promotion that I am going to be able to give you, it does not come with a second modem. The second modem, they are going to charge you regular price which is like XXX, XXX right now. So I would recommend you take the gig because it is, it is the fastest, so it is going to be able to service all you have anyway. I do not think you will need to add with this. I, I am confident you are not going to need to. I would rather you do that then you get two different modems then you pay the additional cost when the gig, I am confident is going to resolve your situation"" [Customer] ""I would, if it is only one modem. You know I am talking about reaching Is it, you know, is they are going to reach that is what I am concerned about is the passion going to reach down to the basement."" [Agent] ""Well, that is my thing too. That is my thing too is I could do this another way. We could set up, set it up in two different places so I could give you. And then and and you let me know if this makes sense. If it is just for the cameras, I could set up this particular account right here just for the cameras and give you like the XXX and, you know, that would be lower or what I recommend is just keep this gig. And then I give you the XXX set up for the basement."" [Customer] ""No, I would rather just keep it all in one service."" [Agent] ""So then you would go with the gig then so that is uh I would recommend keeping the gig, right?"" [Customer] ""On one bill."" [Agent] ""And then if you want to add another modem, then we could always add another modem and we could work that out but I do not want you to pay for something that you do not need or pay for something, you know, if this will resolve it. Now if this is your, again this is your situation if you want I can add another modem right now, um just the XXX me adding that you are looking at instead of paying XXX Let me see here you are looking at. At least Let me see here. Because you were, you are more than you were more than triple I mean more than double your payment But to just go with the XXX, you are looking at an additional. So instead of paying XXX you would be paying XXX."" [Customer] ""So the, no, what is the price of the XXX megabit internet with two modems?"" [Agent] ""OK, so if you were to do it that way. Let me see here. Let us see here. OK, so if you were to do it the other way around, excuse me, you would be looking at like XXX, so you would, you would save like $40."" [Customer] ""So I What is the, has the more level is in the"" [Agent] ""Well that is what I am saying because you can not I am giving you because I am giving you a promo, so you can not get two promos at the same time"" [Customer] ""I do not understand."" [Agent] ""So, um, it is not charging you regular price like I am still and, and even with the second modem, I am still giving you a discount on that because. The regular price, that is, you know, that is why you are possibly not understanding the regular price um for these things. Is what you would be subjected to. So, you know, the XXX is, is XXX. No, it is actually 2:20."" [Customer] ""OK, so When you add a second modem, is there? Am I paying just for that extra modem like a one time fee is like the bill changed monthly"" [Agent] ""No, so that that is what I am saying the bill changes monthly. That is why I am recommending you just go with the gig at XXX and you feel it out because we could be X weeks in, X weeks in, and then, you know, Mr. Conn, you would be like, hey Ron, I want that other modem, and then we could just add it. But I, I would rather you, you know, utilize it first, the gig to confirm if that is viable for you. If you want to add another modem, I can certainly do that. It will be the same bill, same location, same everything. I am just not."" [Customer] ""But what if it is like a"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Like a router, you know, like the, the mesh connections. So it is all one Wi Fi service or internet. I just have. Different I I have a large space. I am not going to, you know if I have a XX,XXX square foot area I am not going to get XX different modems Right."" [Agent] ""Well, that, it depends. What people do is they would get like the pro Wi Fi and then they would get, um, which allows them to have an access point on each level. So an access point covers XXXX ft."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So if you had XX,XXX square feet, that would just be X access points, you know, X access points is like XXX on your bill. So I mean like even that, that is a solvable, that is a solvable situation like what you have is a solvable situation, it is just up to you how you want to solve it."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I, I really just want the same internet that is up, that is upstairs. I want it downstairs as well."" [Agent] ""OK, so that is where we are at right now with the XXXXs."" [Customer] ""So just what whether it is."" [Agent] ""And what I could do is what I could do, go ahead."" [Customer] ""And so this is like one mode, the pro Wi Fi you are talking about, what is that?"" [Agent] ""So the pro WiFi, that is what I was recommended to you before, but you said you are not going to share Wi Fi with your guests. Pro WiFi is a guest network. It allows you to give your customers their own internet, so it does not interfere with your internet. It does not interfere with your bandwidth and they access it based on your control so they can log in with an. They can log in by just clicking log in and then you determine how long they could be on there. You can let them be on there for X hour, X hours, XX hours indefinitely. And also people use that to market and advertise to their customers. You are collecting their emails you are collecting their phone numbers You could also send, you know, have that data and utilize that information to market and advertise, and it is relatively low. It is, it is much lower than marketing or advertising or what people pay for IT services. So, you know, you, I did not recommend it to you cause you said you do not want to share Wi Fi, but you could easily do that. You could get the gig you could get the pro Wi Fi You would be at like $200 monthly. There is a one-time install of like XXXXX you would be, you know, you would be good to go You know, I could possibly, uh you know, see if I can get you a discount on the install as well So you possibly be looking at just XXXX X time for the install. But um that is another option and that is actually the strongest option because you will have the one gig service to support the office, the cameras and things like that and you will also have that pro Wi Fi that is going to cover any uh any issues with your customers. Your customers are going to be able to log in and complete transactions. Everybody's using their phone nowadays to make a payment. So you know it is for you, it just depends. Do you want the, the X XXX setups you will be at XXX Um, or You know, like I said, the X gig promo, uh, that is going to give you that pro Wi Fi that is, that is $200 even."" [Customer] ""And but the pro Wi Fi is besides the. Because I do not, you know, the customers do not need access where I am at. I just need to be able to access the internet anywhere from my space. But that is what it is."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so I So that is why I think you are, you are really making the strongest argument for what you have the XXXXs, and because you would be a new customer and you are getting, you know, you would be getting two modems with us, I can definitely reach out to my supervisor to get a free install um with regards to the XXX, I think there may be that is what an auto pay option without auto pay it will be 3:30 um there may be, let me see if there is something I can do here."" [Customer] ""So I do not want to be in the basement then there is no connection I get the XXX service. With the phone And X routers, not X modems."" [Agent] ""Right. Let me see here."" [Customer] ""Well, I do not know if it is the same."" [Agent] ""Just Mhm."" [Customer] ""I have Verizon at home right now, and it is, I have two different routers. But it is like it is one service wherever I am in the house, it just connects."" [Agent] ""Right, it is and it is the same thing, so you are going to have two different routers with the same service and you are making that argument for that like you said, you do not want to go in the basement and not have service. You do not want to be in your office and not have service. So this is where, you know, we are going to make sure that you are able to have that, and that is going to be with this set up. You are going to have the phone, uh, you are going to and it is going to come with that fail over too, so the failover is going to, it is going to support that so you are going to be good to go with that. You are going to have the connectivity that you need. And you are at the base level of the XXX. So if at any time you wanted to go up, you could certainly do that. Do I think that this is more than enough or, you know, basically to resolve your situation, I think it is because it is, it covers you on the floor and then it comes you and it covers you above and you are not. Extending any bandwidth to your customers, so you should be good to go."" [Customer] ""Yeah, what is the price on that?"" [Agent] ""Um, you would be at 3:30. You would be at 3:30 even and that is what our auto pay with autopay you would be at 3:25, and if you got a mobile phone, uh, with us, you would be able to get an additional discount."" [Customer] ""But you said this is X services now."" [Agent] ""Right, exactly, you are going to have X modems."" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""Yes sir."" [Customer] ""I do not want some modems."" [Agent] ""OK, so what is it that you want then because I misunderstood on my bad."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I want One service, one bill. And I just want blanket coverage over my space."" [Agent] ""OK, so that was the"" [Customer] ""So the only actually thing that like,"" [Agent] ""Go ahead."" [Customer] ""The XXX service, it starts at what? What is the price for the XXX service?"" [Agent] ""So what are we talking now? We are talking one."" [Customer] ""Just a regular X."" [Agent] ""Go ahead."" [Customer] ""Just a regular XXX MB service. The regular internet service, one thing with the phone line. How much is that?"" [Agent] ""OK, one second here. Where did I go? OK, so you are looking at XXX. And it is actually, yeah, it is actually more than that one second here."" [Customer] ""It is uh"" [Agent] ""She just wanted the XXX."" [Customer] ""Yeah, uh, because when I saw it online, it was the reason I called is because I saw it at $60 a month, XXX service. I know that is just the internet."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so the $300 yeah, so it is $60 when you bundle it, it is $60 when you bundle it with something and based on what you said, sir, you know, we could give you that, that is not going to satisfy your situation at all.""

Yeah, miss, yeah, I am just telling you we would be interested in doing everything we, we had the last time we just want to make sure if, if you are offering a price for us to come back to entice us to come back, we would come back that price has to be right, right So we want it to be $60 a month for the first year and speeds up to to a gigabyte. That that is when that is how we will come back, but we, we would keep everything the same as how it was last time. So if you are saying IT address and and if we have firewall protection like last time exactly like last time, nothing new then yes we would do it but if not then we are we are not going to do it."" [Agent] ""So the X gig internet runs $80 for our for the offer that we can make. I can offer you a $10 discount on there so I can offer it down to $70. That is the lowest I am able to get it down to with that, um, now, but adding a static IP on there the static IP runs $20 and I do have the ability to offer a different an additional discount So between the two. I can offer the static IP and the Internet at $80."" [Customer] ""That sounds great so. Right, hold on, I have a question. Uh, I am sorry, sir. Let me just ask. OK, so let us say we are in a billing cycle the speed is up to X gigabyte, right Can you confirm it is up to X gigabyte?"" [Agent] ""Yes, you would be getting the X gig internet."" [Customer] ""OK, great. So let me ask you this question. And within the billing cycle, is it possible that those states are not diminished or they or they are unlimited speed, uh, per gigabyte every single month, month after month?"" [Agent] ""It is unlimited."" [Customer] ""OK, I think I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I think what Andrew's asking is any data you need to limitate."" [Agent] ""No."" [Customer] ""OK. Um, what happens after the first year? How much can the bill be expected to go up after the first year?"" [Agent] ""So this is a X year price guarantee. After the X years you see an increase of around $30 to $40 then you are able to renegotiate your price"" [Customer] ""OK, and how does it work with uh equipment? You guys send all that equipment for free?"" [Agent] ""Um, so we would have to send out a technician to restart your equipment because it looks like you have returned all equipment."" [Customer] ""That is true, yes. So that the prices, yeah, because that, yeah, is that an extra cost or no?"" [Agent] ""So yes, there is a one time installation of XXX."" [Customer] ""Would you be able to waive that installation fee just knowing that we are coming back to you guys. I mean, I know that you are being, you are, you are being really nice to offer us a great deal to come back at the same time we have been the customers for a long time before being that loyal to come back, we would appreciate if maybe you guys could even waive that installation fee for us"" [Agent] ""I am just not sure about how many discounts I can apply on here since we are already bringing it down much lower than it originally is."" [Customer] ""Because now we will be with you guys for X years."" [Agent] ""Our X gig for new customers runs about $120. And so we have already lowered it $60."" [Customer] ""Well, I mean, I mean it is worth checking into."" [Agent] ""I can definitely ask my supervisor."" [Customer] ""I mean was checking into just considering. Alright, yeah, sure, if, if you would not mind that'd be really helpful because like I said, we are, we are coming back and now not only be coming back we are, we are, we plan on staying with you guys for X plus more years"" [Agent] ""OK. OK, give me X 2nd."" [Customer] ""And then you get month after month payment. OK, thank you. Having, having an executive committee is crazy."" [Agent] ""OK, you there?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, hi, how are you?"" [Agent] ""Hi, so my supervisor wanted to ask what are y'all doing about your mobile services for the business?"" [Customer] ""Uh, we would not, I am sorry we would not be interested in the mobile Thank you so much though."" [Agent] ""Cause I mean with our Optimum mobile services even just like looking into it today we would be able to offer that free installation um as well as I mean with you getting the services at just $80 monthly you would see a $40 discount with bundling, so it would bring your monthly total down to just $40 monthly for the internet."" [Customer] ""That is fine. I, I mean we are we are comfortable with with our mobile now No, no, yeah, I can not, I can not change mobile because my son's in the military."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""We have a military discount. So we have an incredible deal on our on our mobile services because I am not going to change it. We, we have a military, the phones are through the military."" [Agent] ""I mean we can we have the ability to offer lines at $25 a piece depending on how many lines you are offering like and so I mean we we do have that as well as unlimi talk text with data and then it is on our T-Mobile network so it is on one of the largest networks available."" [Customer] ""Yeah At this point now, um we are very busy. We really want to restate your internet, you know we will think about everything in the future right now we want to get the internet back on"" [Agent] ""OK, give me one second then."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I think that, I mean, yeah, but, but, and, and how about also, you know, just knowing that look, we are coming back, we are going to be paying month over month payments to optimum as new as once again customers. I mean it would be great just to have that technician come again and and do the installation for free knowing that we had to return the boxes and go through all of that just to return the boxes. I mean, It is just what we would really appreciate if the if the person can come out here and just just do it, take care of it up for us and not having to pay that again because if you think about it we got to pay that once before now we are going to have to pay it again. So so it would just be"" [Agent] ""Because we are having to reestablish services we are still having to send out our technician and pay our technician to come and install the equipment at the location so I definitely get where you are coming back, where you are coming back to us, and we are honoring that with giving you a discount on our one gig which brings it down. A lot lower than what a new customer would even pay with us and so I mean I am just making sure we can apply all of the discounts that are being needed like that you are requesting on the account because we do we do have to pay our technician and things along that line to come out to the business."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I know. I listen, I understand all that mess, and I I do respect the technician's time and effort, but look, I, I mean, we have been customer for you guys before We are going to be paying a lot more money. You are going to get all that money back, uh, and then some based on monthly payments and month over month. Um, you guys can make an exception just to, you know, not have, not charge us for that amount."" [Agent] ""Let me see, I am waiting on a response from my supervisor."" [Customer] ""Alright thanks I really appreciate that because look, I mean you guys made a lot, a lot of money just based on month over month payments again."" [Agent] ""But we are, like I said already cutting the price in half with our X gig. We are offering you the X gig at half the price of what a customer pays a regular customer would pay coming into us so I mean we are applying a lot of discounts on here to win you back to us so I am just verifying that we can, we can waive the installation"" [Customer] ""Alright, thank you. I appreciate you making the effort to find that out for us."" [Agent] ""OK, so we did get approval to go ahead and waive the installation and it looks like I can send out a technician on Friday the 16th between X and XX."" [Customer] ""I, uh, that was that you are amazing by the way, um, and I really appreciate you doing that on our behalf. So you said on Friday the at what time?"" [Agent] ""I have an X to XX on Friday the 16th."" [Customer] ""Dude, does that work for you? I got to check my schedule. Give me one second. I could be, yes. Um, And they will set everything up because because we have we have fax line we have everything so they will be able to make sure that it is all working well."" [Agent] ""So now this does not have any."" [Customer] ""Well, the, the fact finding stuff."" [Agent] ""Yeah, this has no phones."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, you are already set up for that. I, I, I am confused, OK. So the phone service is this like right right now also the, the Wi Fi in the back office, it does not reach there. Is there any way they can bring some kind of duplicator or some kind of uh extender, or do I have to buy that on my own?"" [Agent] ""Um, so we do not offer any type of extenders to our business unless it is what we call pro Wi Fi, which is a guest network but also extends up to XXXX square foot. Um, if you are wanting any type of like small little extender, you would purchase it yourself."" [Customer] ""OK, so I could buy like like from Google or whatever like that and that would, that would go through."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Uh, I, I have an ethernet cable in the back that would go to the Ethernet cable and then the ether that is fine. I, I will talk to my, my, OK. Alright, um, so that that is something I could talk to someone else about I guess, right Do it, do it, do it um independently."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""OK, alright, so I could be there at XX, yes."" [Agent] ""And do you have a number you want us to call before we show?"" [Customer] ""Yes, my cell phone XXX. XXXXXXX"" [Agent] ""OK, so I have got you scheduled for Friday the 16th between X and XX to get our X gig package. It is a X year price guarantee that does include our static IPs at just $80 monthly with no installation charge."" [Customer] ""Thank you so much really appreciate it."" [Agent] ""Yes sir, we appreciate you calling. We hope you have a wonderful rest of your day."" [Customer] ""Thank you very much. I really appreciate it. Thank you so much."" [Agent] ""Thank you."" [Customer] ""Take care. Alright, thank you, Andrew. I will talk to you later. Thank you so much. That is everything I was after. OK, thank you so much. Awesome. Take care. Bye bye."""
Call176,"[Agent] ""Thank you for calling Optimum now offering Optimum Mobile. This is Sam from the commercial sales department. How may I be of assistance?"" [Customer] ""Hi. Um, Hold on one second, I am just trying to get back to where our account is. OK, we currently have a business account with you we are doing business internet only We had switched to Verizon for phone service quite some time a little while ago. Um, and I am just interested to see what options you guys have if we were to come back for phone service."" [Agent] ""OK, can you confirm the business name and address please?"" [Customer] ""Yes, so the business is Pinnacle Press LLC."" [Agent] ""And the address please just to confirm."" [Customer] ""XXXX Post Road. XDX Fairfield, Connecticut XXXXX and our phone number is XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Agent] ""May I have your name so I can address you properly, please?"" [Customer] ""My name is Nicole."" [Agent] ""Thank you, Nicole. The phone number that I have here that you are calling from ends in XXXX. Would that be the best number to call you on that just in case we get disconnected?"" [Customer] ""That would be fine."" [Agent] ""OK perfect thank you so I have XXX-XXXXXXX OK. Right now I am just going into your account. And we will discuss the different types of phone services that we have and then hopefully we can find something that meets your needs. Do you recall the X digit access code for the account?"" [Customer] ""Um, oh, good lord."" [Agent] ""If you have a bill nearby, it should be towards the top of your bill if you have a recent one."" [Customer] ""Um, Oh, OK, hold on, I do have XX, XXXX."" [Agent] ""Do not put me on the stand so they may say I let the witness, but."" [Customer] ""Yes, oh my God, thank God, you know, because I was trying to pull up our bills, so I am like looking at and like to see we are having such problems with Verizon, so like it is, it is so frustrating."" [Agent] ""OK, well, I am sorry that you are having trouble I am glad that you are giving us a call"" [Customer] ""So, Yeah."" [Agent] ""Hopefully we will have the opportunity to earn your business back so talk to me about phone numbers."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Can you advise me how many phone numbers you have in total, please?"" [Customer] ""Um, Well, we have right now we have the one main line which is XXX-XXX-XXXX. And I think what we would like to do is simplify back to just that because. I, I think that The problem is that what is confusing is when we switch to Verizon then we added a line in each desk we are not the the physical space that we are a big business but the physical space that we are in is not big and managing this hunt group and all of this stuff is not, it is just it is too difficult."" [Agent] ""May I, may I ask a question, um, to see if I can maybe guide myself a little bit towards what you may need."" [Customer] ""Um, Yeah."" [Agent] ""How many people do you have in the office that are actually slated to pick up calls?"" [Customer] ""Right, like it is that is the thing like it is a printing we own a printing company, so it is not really like just it is whoever is getting the phone does that make sense? Like someone's answering the calls like you know my my wife and I own the company um she primarily is doing the selling, so she primarily answers the phone."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Um, but it is, and then we have another kid who works another gentleman who works for us who deals with a lot of customers and so with Verizon they did have separate lines but what we are looking to do is just go back to a single. Line with a virtual receptionist."" [Agent] ""So basically, if you only have one phone number you can only be on one phone call at a time"" [Customer] ""Right, but there is call waiting."" [Agent] ""But once again, you can only be on one phone call at a time. Like if let us say somebody calls in the XXXX phone number, that call waiting is going to beep and then that person you press flash, you go to the second person, you take care of the second person plus flash you come back to the other line That, that is literally what that is. It does not, if you have a virtual receptionist, the calls are not going to go anywhere because you only have that XXXX. You would have to have at least two phone numbers and what a virtual receptionist does is basically it guides the customers."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Um, thank you for calling Pinnacle Press Hour of operations and location press one for, um, you know, for orders press X for billing. Press X and behind those numbers are whatever phone numbers you want to call to go to whether it is um the gentleman's cell phone, whether it is your wife's um desk number you know it could be that but it would still be a phone number. Having just one line does not give you multiple extensions per se."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So we can simplify it to maybe X lines where the first line is busy to roll over to the second so that way you can be on at least X phone calls at any given time because so far it seems like there is just X of you in the office."" [Customer] ""OK. Yeah, it is just their system was so complicated to figure out and it keeps going out like it keeps literally going out like the service keeps going out and when I go on to um."" [Agent] ""Mm."" [Customer] ""The platform there I am just going to like just speak to uh like the the the platform that to manage it is very difficult. Um, hard for me to step in. It was hard for me to step in and learn it. Um, a previous person had purchased it. It is extremely expensive, um."" [Agent] ""Wow."" [Customer] ""And We need phones that we can be able to walk around with. And when it is set up this way it is like so my wife has her own voicemail that she has to check and then Anthony has his own voicemail that he has to check and then there is a separate mailbox that needs to be checked too many different voicemails that need to be checked every day. And so we are missing calls if that makes sense we are missing those messages because we are just too busy like no one can check all those messages."" [Agent] ""OK, can I a moment for the just too busy. That is a good problem to have."" [Customer] ""Yeah, thank you, yeah, like we are facing our business, yeah, thank you, yeah, yeah, so, um."" [Agent] ""Just a moment for that statement right there. Now that we can now we can put that to the side and let us go ahead and continue to find solutions for you."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""So if it makes you feel any better or any more comfortable, our Optimum voice service like you had it before, has not changed. It is the same optimum voice service if you have already a username and password with our platform, it is the same one."" [Customer] ""OK. Yeah."" [Agent] ""There is nothing that you really have to relearn."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Because it is that same platform, it is our same web portal. Like I see that the phones left back in like the phone number left I guess back like in December of XXXX, so maybe a year and a half now we will say that you have been on this different phone system so not that we do not go ahead and continue to work on our services it is just."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""That this is pretty much established, you know what I am saying? XX calling features voice, you know, it is optimum voice."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""You picked the phone, so if you want to purchase like DJs or staples, you want to purchase a two line cordless phone with a couple of handsets, that is fine. That is as simple as it needs to be. does not really need to be more complicated than that. I could just give you the downtown and that'll be all. Just like you had it before, give you two phone numbers."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""If you have X phone numbers with them and you want us to support the X phone numbers, then I can take care of that. If you have one number that you want to keep and you want us to generate a second number for you, that is fine. Um, if I am not mistaken, it seems like we only port it out one line. So maybe if you are a little bit busy you might benefit from having that second line the way that the voicemail works is if somebody calls the first line It goes from the first line, that line is busy, it goes to the 2nd line. If the second line is busy, then it goes to voicemail on line X. That is it."" [Customer] ""OK, so there is only one voicemail box."" [Agent] ""If somebody There is only one voicemail box. Let us say for our human's sake that that second phone number that you give, that I am sorry, the 2nd phone number that we gave you for the rollover number. If you give that number out to somebody, if they call that number directly and you act and there is a whole bunch of ants, and you activate a voicemail on that one, then somebody can leave a voicemail on it. But normally what you would do is that you would just Um, advertise your primary number. There is no reason for you to advertise that second number."" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""So if nobody knows that second number, nobody's calling you directly nobody's leaving voicemails on that end"" [Customer] ""OK, alright."" [Agent] ""So as long as it is, it is, it is keeping it kind of you know, very simplistic, which in this case seems to be the goal"" [Customer] ""Um, OK, yeah. Yeah, and we could just go and buy whatever phones we want to use, right?"" [Agent] ""As long as they are regular phones in the sense of like not ethernet jacks."" [Customer] ""OK, not."" [Agent] ""They are regular phones like the optimum voice phones or regular phones, meaning on the back of the modem, you can even look at the modem that you have right now. You will see a port X, a port X most likely, and you will see that it is just a regular phone jack. You will not see an Ethernet jack X, which is the X prog. You will see a X-prong, which is the traditional phone phone jack. Now, if you want Optimum to provide you physical phones and you want to do, you know, a more, not necessarily complex but more robust phone system with a different platform and everything, we do offer a voice over IP option, but that sounds similar to what you have right now, although I am very happy to say that ours does work. Um, it seems like you are trying to step away from that."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""So yes, you can go to Best Buy, you can go to PC Richards if they are still around. Sorry, I just hate myself. Um, you can go to Staples, Office Max, wherever he wants, get like, you know a cordless phone"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""You can get a cordless phone with a few handsets that you can just plug into the back of the modem and the other ones get electricity you are ready to roll"" [Customer] ""OK, OK, and that, that, yeah, OK, so that makes sense and then um. And then so with the virtual receptionist. That just links to the voicemail, right? That is part of the voicemail service."" [Agent] ""Actually, the virtual receptionist is um something a little different than voicemail. Virtual reception is is a call routing system. So basically you tell the system this is where I want the calls to go. Um, when they press X, when they press XXX, whatever the case may be."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Once it goes to that, let us say that you use uh your wife's cell phone as the phone number for orders. If it goes, it once it, once it goes into your wife's cellphone, if they leave a message, it will be on her phone."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Because the call was directed at your discretion was directed to her voicemail, meaning it was directed to her cell phone, so she will pick up that call there where she wants to go ahead and just let it go to voicemail, she can do it."" [Customer] ""OK, alright, so first of all, receptionist, OK, um, how much is."" [Agent] ""Yeah, it is literally just a yeah it is literally just the call routing system. You keep it for as long as you you keep on listening."" [Customer] ""OK, and then one would go so you could have, you know, press X for direction, press X for you know our website information, press X for store hours, press X to speak to a customer service, whatever, right?"" [Agent] ""You are going to ask a question, sorry. Yeah, you go ahead and decide you you go ahead and decide what the options you wanted to be behind those numbers are you also have the opportunity to decide what is getting"" [Customer] ""Something like that."" [Agent] ""You know where it is, you know, where it is routed to so that is literally all it is and that is all managed from the web portal."" [Customer] ""OK, got it. OK, um, alright, so just, so I am trying to figure out what my next question needs to be here."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""All right, um."" [Agent] ""What is the price?"" [Customer] ""We have, uh, so we have, yeah, I need the price I also like, when we went to Verizon, we bought all their fancy phones That is the other thing, like, I do not know how to use the phone. I do not know how to hang it up. We have to stay at the desk with these phones. There is no handsets that move around and we are an active print shop, you know, with machines running and stuff and so like that is it is been a big problem, um, and like my payoff is."" [Agent] ""Mhm. That sounds very restrictive."" [Customer] ""Yeah it is it is the whole thing has been just just the whole thing um uh we have like a payoff to get out of our contract you guys work with that or?"" [Agent] ""I could check, but based on the fact that we are just porting over one phone number and for the discounts that we are providing you, I, I do not know how deep that that discount that, um, early termination fee refund would be."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""I could check for you, but I do not expect it to be um very high, and by the way, we do not have any contracts or cancellation charges."" [Customer] ""OK, yeah, alright."" [Agent] ""So let me take a look."" [Customer] ""Um, And I am assuming that the phones that I have from them that I will not be able to use, is that right?"" [Agent] ""If they are, and they do sound like they are, if they are voice over IP phones, I do not think that would be the case."" [Customer] ""That they are not going to work, yeah."" [Agent] ""No, I do not think that would be the case because they sound like voice over IP phones."" [Customer] ""Uh Yeah, so frustrating. Um, OK, so tell me then, uh, what is the price, uh, what would, what what is your, what is the price"" [Agent] ""OK, so did you want me to, I am going to go ahead and quote it to you, my apologies. I am going to go ahead and quote it to you with two phone numbers for the, uh, virtual receptionist in there."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""OK, so for me in a couple of seconds."" [Customer] ""Yeah, oh, and we do have internet with you guys too so."" [Agent] ""Yes, of course it will be added on to that account. I am actually working. On a pricing structure for a bundle per se. Did they tell you what your early termination fee might be?"" [Customer] ""No, not yet. I was calling you first and then."" [Agent] ""OK, just wondering."" [Customer] ""And just to call them."" [Agent] ""Just wondering, OK, so just sit tight for me a couple of seconds and I will give you the pricing structures all together. So I apologize. I think I know the answer, but I just want to go ahead and get it with certainty. How many phone numbers do you have with them right now?"" [Customer] ""Um, we have. Uh, I am just looking at the devices. I have got X devices. And we have Um, Hold on. I If he is not there. OK. Uh Um, Let me just go. I think I have XX lines. I think I have X, I have X lines then the main line Does that make sense?"" [Agent] ""So that is fine."" [Customer] ""So there is the main line and then that that spawns off into the three other lines."" [Agent] ""So total of X, OK. Do you, do you mind if I ask how much you are paying for your services with them?"" [Customer] ""I, I, I think. Uh, Um Oh, let me find where my bill is here. Um Um Insanity just because you can not even find the the bell like it is just."" [Agent] ""Yeah, well, at the end of the month, how much are you paying altogether like taxes and all that fun because I am about to go ahead and give you that price altogether so I just want to make sure that we are comparing apples to apples as well"" [Customer] ""Uh-huh. Yeah, you know what, I can not, it is um. Mm. It is really bad that you can not even log in and see what your bill is, right? Like, I do not. Um, Sorry."" [Agent] ""Do not be sorry, you are giving me the opportunity to go ahead and work on your rates, so you are making me look real efficient, OK, because by the time you find your, by the time you find your codes, I am going to pretty much be done with mine and I will be like, that is great."" [Customer] ""OK good I am sorry. I, uh"" [Agent] ""This is the this is what I can do. Do not tell my secret though on this recorded conversation."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I know. I just. Um, so we can go. Mhm Mhm. OK. Here we go. Alright, so it is. X XXXXX."" [Agent] ""So at the end of the month, you pay for everything that you have with them XXXXX including taxes, is that correct?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, so yeah, taxes are XXX, surcharges $19.90 equipment charges XXXX. Monthly charges $95."" [Agent] ""OK, perfect."" [Customer] ""Yeah, XXXX."" [Agent] ""So about X, they basically XXX. So right now overall, let us see, so you are at XXX on this end and XXX on the other, you are at XXX."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Overall on your services, OK, so let us see what."" [Customer] ""And, and I, I have a payoff on these phones like of $348.30 but I still owe them. I just calculated my payoff on the equipment with them."" [Agent] ""OK, so as far as my pricing is concerned. Um, I am including. An upgrade on your internet speed. Like right now, you have a promotion on your XXX speed that is slated to end in December."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""Because you had a you got a XX month promo, so that is $65 just slated to end in December, so that $175."" [Customer] ""OK. Mhm."" [Agent] ""would go up by XX to XXX. So what I am basically doing is extending a promotion, upgrading it to a gig speed of service, so you have faster speed. So you know, with printing you are always downloading information, pictures and things of the sort. So anything that could make you more efficient would be better. Um, I am including the two phone numbers, your modem, your router, your premier technical support, a connection failover service, um, for the off chance that maybe our main internet is down, it will go ahead and bring your. Um, you will be able to go ahead and have your main internet service, um, working, um, on that end, um, the pricing structure that I am creating for you without any contracts or cancellation charges would be a X year promotion. You have been a valued customer of ours for a few years now. More than a few years, I am seeing almost XX, almost XX years now at this point at this location."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So the system is allowing me to go ahead and extend that and pass the normal X years to a X year promotion. So it is something that you can kind of settle in and be OK with for any reason you need to switch out, you need to retire, you guys won the lottery, you are going to go off to see the world, feel free"" [Customer] ""Uh-huh. Very much, yeah, that would be great."" [Agent] ""You know, um, just connect your services, you, that is it, you are good to go. Um, our pricing structure, including the, um, virtual receptionist would be $315 your taxes would be about $11 So you are pretty much staying within the pricing structure that you are in now you are doubling your internet speed That is one. You have your virtual receptionist."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""You have your two phone numbers you also have that connection fail over service The connection fail over service in case the main internet goes down automatically switches over to that LTE service. So basically it connects through the cell towers in the area so that if you do have any issues, um. While we are connecting, you will still be able to get online because you will have that field over service that will connect your six main devices. So that once again would be a total of $300. I apologize. I do not know why I think I might have said $315. So it is $300 plus the, I would say $11 in taxes."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""So if you are doing the math of what you are paying right now, you are paying $175 plus the $145 you are about $320."" [Customer] ""Around"" [Agent] ""In this case, you would be at XXX plus XX, you would be around XXX, and remember that price is good for X years, no contract and no cancellation charges. I looked at the calculator and I put in like, you know, just to put in a random figure, I put in that you would need $500 towards an early termination fee and the maximum that it approved and I would note the account is $351. So if you get an early termination fee from your existing provider, you can email it to um business ETF business early termination fee very aptly um chosen by our team at optimum.com."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""You submit your final bill with that you put a circle on your early termination fee You put your account number you put your phone number on the X to X weeks, you get a check We pay you, you pay them."" [Customer] ""OK, OK, so if they, so if like my payoff for my um. Equipment or whatever if they put that as an early termination fee."" [Agent] ""I can only say whatever the early termination fee. What is there, they will make that determination, you know, it is, it is, I do not want to say, yeah, sure, they will cover everything, you know, put your, put yesterday's dinner on you."" [Customer] ""OK, OK."" [Agent] ""It has to be under that early termination fee kind of situation."" [Customer] ""Mm OK, and you said it would be X XXX."" [Agent] ""So, um, it would approve up to up. XXX is exactly what they gave me when I put in the request for $500."" [Customer] ""X XXX, OK."" [Agent] ""So if it, so if, so let us say for you say that your early termination fee happens to be $200 you will get $200."" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""If your early termination fee happens to be $400 you will get $351 just so we are clear."" [Customer] ""OK. Got it. OK."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""um, can, can you email this to me or are you, how do you do this?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, when this is, well, I would not email it to you when the system, when you, when we process the order in just a few moments, the system will go ahead and send you an email confirmation to the email on record, and if you need me to update it, I will update it as well. But the system sent you that email."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Once we process the order, so yeah."" [Customer] ""OK, um."" [Agent] ""Yeah, the install for the phone numbers to be ported over is 79.99. That is a one time charge, and that is basically all, yeah, that is basically all there is to it."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK. Oh, so we have to pay a port charge, OK."" [Agent] ""Well, the technician has to go out there to install the services whether we were going out there to install new numbers or you were reporting them, that price that I just gave you includes everything, meaning the port request, the port charges, and the technician going out there to install it would be XXXX."" [Customer] ""Right. OK, OK."" [Agent] ""Yeah, any swapping out, any swapping out of equipment to upgrade you to the gig speed of service, there is no charge for that. There is no charge to install the connection failover service also includes the premier technical support if you need any assistance with networking past the demarcation point you let us know Trouble calls are included within the premier tech. support. So basically you are, you are in XXXX with Optimum at this point, you know, you are getting the top speed, you are getting our traditional optimum voice service which you were familiar with before, you know, and hopefully worked to your liking for the past XX years until, you know, something changed, so."" [Customer] ""OK, alright, um, OK, can I, do you have like a certain extension that I can call you back at, or, um, I just, I."" [Agent] ""No, unfortunately we are in a call center so we do not have direct extensions. I mean, is there a possibility that I hold for you while you speak to your wife?"" [Customer] ""Um, I do not think so. Like, I, I need to call Verizon, so I have to just like I want to call them and just see if um. Like what I was calling you first to get the information um and then I need to call them."" [Agent] ""And just said I mean keep in mind that because we are reporting the same phone number you would not go ahead and cancel services with them."" [Customer] ""And see what Yeah."" [Agent] ""We would request the phone number on your behalf. In fact, that is a big no no. We definitely ask you not to call them to cancel it. You can speak to them, of course, because they are your service provider, but just do not cancel the services because if you do then we can not keep the phone number That is a really bad thing."" [Customer] ""Right, yeah, no, of course, yeah, yeah, and then we would schedule the."" [Agent] ""Mhm"" [Customer] ""We would schedule you when we wanted you to come, right?"" [Agent] ""That is correct, yes, and normally it would be about like today is the 13th."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Under normal circumstances it would probably be around the 21st, 22nd, or 23rd, depending on what port um date it gives me."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And that is under normal circumstances that kind of situation"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So you have plenty of time to reach out to them and you know with Optimum that if you set up an appointment and for any reason you decide against it, you can just cancel the appointment."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""I mean, I do not want my hard work to. To go in vain, but if you wanted to cancel it, you can go ahead and cancel the whole thing."" [Customer] ""Yeah, oK."" [Agent] ""I just want you to feel comfortable with what it is that you are doing so that you can go ahead and move forward with what we are, what we are talking about."" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""You can call and get all your ducks in a row, T's dot T's crossed, I dotted all that fun stuff and feel comfortable with what you are doing and say, OK, I did make a good decision"" [Customer] ""Yeah, OK, so just can you just go through this with me one more time."" [Agent] ""I mean you are going to, yeah, yeah."" [Customer] ""So it is, it is XX phone lines, X phone lines."" [Agent] ""Yeah, absolutely."" [Customer] ""Um, the virtual. Receptionist. Um, the, um. Uh, the XXX speed you said on the internet?"" [Agent] ""It is actually being doubled to one gig."" [Customer] ""OK, XX, OK, one gig."" [Agent] ""Mhm. So XXX megs, so XXX megs is the equivalent of XXXX megs, but when you go to XXXX megs, it is then stated as X gig."" [Customer] ""One gig So, OK, so we are upgrading to one gig of. Internet"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""And, and, um, and it is good for X years."" [Agent] ""Correct without any contracts or cancellations."" [Customer] ""No contract. Or Cancellations right and um. We can email for or we. Early termination payback of up to $351 and our total bill."" [Agent] ""Yep, and that email if you like just to go ahead so that you have all your books in a row together that email address is business"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah."" [Agent] ""ETF"" [Customer] ""Yes. It is"" [Agent] ""And an early termination fee."" [Customer] ""EXF, uh-huh."" [Agent] ""At Optimum.com."" [Customer] ""At Mm OK. OK, and we have to pay a XXXX."" [Agent] ""That could spelled out."" [Customer] ""Install fee, OK, and it is our bill would be about XX X no I am sorry $311 per month, right?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, right now I am, yeah, right now I am seeing $300 for the services the taxes are about $11"" [Customer] ""OK. OK, OK, can you give me just one second? I am just going to call her, OK?"" [Agent] ""I will give you, well we have been on the phone for maybe about, exactly"" [Customer] ""XX XX minutes, yeah."" [Agent] ""So if you, if, if you need more than a second, you have it."" [Customer] ""OK, OK, um, yeah, so I have to actually hold. I am working from home today she is in the office, so just I am going to just"" [Agent] ""Yeah, so just go right ahead and if we get disconnected, I have the XXXX, no worries, take your time."" [Customer] ""I OK, yes, you can call me back. OK. All right. Hold on."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""Wait, tell me your first name again?"" [Agent] ""Sandra, S A N D R A."" [Customer] ""And um, OK, hold on, alright, hold on."" [Agent] ""Thank you. No worries."" [Customer] ""Oh wait, in fact, I wonder if you could just add her. Let me just see if I can add her. Maybe I can add her. Oh, Sandra?"" [Agent] ""I am still here."" [Customer] ""Hello. Oh, you are still there? OK, OK, my wife Cheryl, she is on the phone."" [Agent] ""So Hi, Cheryl."" [Customer] ""Hey Sandra, how are you?"" [Agent] ""I am great."" [Customer] ""Hi, thank you so much."" [Agent] ""I am great. Thank you for joining the call."" [Customer] ""I know you guys. Good. OK, so tell me, what, what do you have? I kind of told her, but Sandra, can you just you explain it so much better than I can. I like rambled through so can you just tell her what we spoke about"" [Agent] ""Yes, of course. So, uh, Nicole was expressing to me the fact that you guys have a Verizon phone system that is maybe not the easiest to work with."" [Customer] ""Thank you."" [Agent] ""It is maybe failing you guys a little bit you had Optimum Voice with us for the better part of about XX years, so you are hoping to maybe revisit Um, seeing what we can do for you as far as phone service, and I was very grateful to Nicole for doing that and giving me the opportunity."" [Customer] ""Correct, yes."" [Agent] ""So our optimum voice service since December of XXXX that you ported out has not really changed. It is still the same unlimited local, regional and long distance in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico with over XX calling features that you had. So it is the same service, it is still a great quality service, no issues there, so you are familiar with the product. So what I did was trying to go ahead and put a package together for you that made sense price wise or incentivizing additional services that would make it worth your time. So if you are looking at your monthly rate right now from the two accounts, meaning what you have with Verizon and what you have with us, your monthly rates about XXX."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""I came up with the price of XXX with a X year promotion without any contracts or cancellation charges. That would include an upgrade that doubles your internet speed to a gig speed of service, that would include your modem, your router, premier technical support your connection failover service"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""X phone numbers so you still have that main number and the capability to be on a 2nd phone call independently so that you could still remain efficient and also the virtual receptionist, virtual receptionist is a call routing system where basically the customer calls into your main line. You can go ahead and set up the call routing systems to say thank you for calling printing press for hours of operation and location press X for orders press X for pickups, press X, and behind those options you decide where to go. You can leave a voicemail you can leave a."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Message after you know after they press one location and time orders could go to your cell phone pickups can go to the gentleman that works with you ladies, you know what I mean? So you guys decide that because you are and it is all on the same platform that you already have access to, so it is not something new that you have to learn or anything like that."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK, oK."" [Agent] ""And as far as the phones. I was just aging myself with Nicole telling her she can go to PC Richards, Best Buy BJ's and just get like nice simple cordless cordless phones because one of the other pain points was the fact that you can not move around"" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""And it seems like that is an issue because you guys, you know, have to be very mobile in your, in your office space."" [Customer] ""Correct. Right."" [Agent] ""So taking those things into consideration, that would be, you know, the best solution and just just regular phones with regular phone jacks on the back of the modem, you will just be able to plug in the main base you can plug in the other phones around the office kind of situation The installation would be XXXX and that would include the porting charge and the technician going to the location to install the phones."" [Customer] ""OK. OK."" [Agent] ""There is no charge for anything else as far as swapping out the equipment for the faster speed, the connection failover, none of that, that is all, you know, that is all there. So you are not increasing your monthly rate, you are definitely increasing your speed and you are coming back to something which you were familiar with that you knew worked."" [Customer] ""OK, and can you help us out with the buyout for the phones for from Verizon?"" [Agent] ""Oh yes, my apologies, yes, she mentioned that and I mentioned the calculator, um, it was XXX, um, that the system based on what you are bringing in, that is what we could assist you with according to the calculator."" [Customer] ""I put"" [Agent] ""So basically she has the information where you would just go ahead and email the early termination fee. Department, um, you would include your for your last month's bill with them. You circle early termination fee, name, phone number, account number, and send it over in X to X weeks. We basically cut you a check and I said clearly say it to her, basically we pay you, you pay them. We have nothing to do with them."" [Customer] ""Got it. OK."" [Agent] ""Yeah, how did I do, Nicole?"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""How was that recap?"" [Customer] ""Um, That is great. That was good. Oh, that was very good."" [Agent] ""OK. Perfect."" [Customer] ""Amazing. That sounds great."" [Agent] ""Mhm Um, I mean, by the end of the phone call you will know exactly what date it is."" [Customer] ""Um, that is fine. That is good with me baby you, Nicole, yeah. Yeah, yeah, it is good and then she said that um once she puts the order through then they will give us the scheduled date so it is not like this is happening tomorrow like I think it would be like when Sandra like next week you said? Mm."" [Agent] ""It is just I just have to get to the calendar page that is all."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so it would probably be some normally it would be about somewhere around between the 21st 2nd, the 23rd, that kind of thing is what, you know most likely the system would provide me"" [Customer] ""Um, what do you think, honey? OK, so yeah, whatever the day it is, that is what it is, and let us do it. OK, alright, yeah, very good, we are good, yep, OK, alright, Sandra, so go ahead."" [Agent] ""OK, perfect, not a problem."" [Customer] ""Um, Yeah."" [Agent] ""So I know the phone number that we are keeping is that the most important one is that XXXX. Did you want me to generate a new number for you is there another phone number you would like for me to port It there is no difference in cost."" [Customer] ""Oh, so there."" [Agent] ""It does not take any more effort. You just tell me how you would like for me to answer it. If you do not have another phone number that you want me to forward, then I can just have the system generate another one for you."" [Customer] ""OK. Hold on one sec, I think what we will do is, um, let me just see if I can get that number that is yours share from your, um, your lane do you just want to start again I think we should start again. I mean this is like a XXX number, yeah, just that is fine because no one has it. It only rolls over to it, so it is no like the XXXX."" [Agent] ""OK, no problem. Not sad lady."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK, yes, so the primary Sandra is that XXX-XXXXXXX. That is the one that we advertise and then the, the second one, let us just give us a new one, yeah."" [Agent] ""Perfect. The system will generate perfect, OK. Um, who is going to sign the yellow, the letter of about XX, will it be Unico, will it be Cheryl?"" [Customer] ""Um, it could be either one or it does not, uh, I can do it."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so I will just put it I am going to call.""

[Agent] ""So we do need to bring you out uh faster equipment as well as our connection back up. Our connection back up is if the internet ever stops working this turns on to continue to support your devices so you do not ever lose internet"" [Customer] ""And I did not have that before, correct?"" [Agent] ""No, this is a brand new device."" [Customer] ""Um, this Oh my goodness."" [Agent] ""Mhm Let me see, let me see when we can get somebody out there to get you all set up now do you use our mobile services as well"" [Customer] ""Mm No."" [Agent] ""No, OK, because we offer Atima mobile now, which is one of our like largest XG networks we can offer speeds we can offer plans as low as just $30 a month when you bring two lines over to us then you would receive a $40 discount on this bill How much do you pay for your cell phone services?"" [Customer] ""I, I, I do not want to fall into that. I, I, I have like X cell phone lines right now. It is, it is not the time for me to switch. I think I play like"" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""I paid $270 I have XX XXXXXX. X, I have X lines. I pay XXX."" [Agent] ""Do you now do all of those nine lines have like the same like promotion on them XX divided."" [Customer] ""Yes, it is under the business account. The Tor."" [Agent] ""OK, you are paying about, yeah, you are paying about $30 a piece for them. Now if we switched over X lines we would be able to offer $25 a piece. So it is, it is a $5 discount, um, per phone, but I mean in the end $5 per $9 or $25.25 dollars you would be paying about $225 so we could save you about $50 monthly then you would get a $40 discount on your internet bill as well"" [Customer] ""It is, it is good. Can I, can I do it at a later time, or it has to do today?"" [Agent] ""No, it does not have to be today. I am just letting you know of other ways we can save you money."" [Customer] ""Yes, yes."" [Agent] ""Now for the upgrade on your Internet, it looks like I can send somebody out tomorrow morning. I have an X to XX."" [Customer] ""Give me X 2nd, OK? Let me consult you with the manager."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""X 2nd. And then Talk about. Then I got up we go. How much is it going to, how, how much is it going to be my new bill? The $90 more?"" [Agent] ""Uh yes, it would be $90 more, so it would bring you back up to what you are paying before."" [Customer] ""Thank you."" [Agent] ""It actually brings you up to $10 less than what you are paying before. It brings you up to $267 after taxes."" [Customer] ""So my new bill will be XXX or XXX?"" [Agent] ""Oh excuse me, XXX. I apologize."" [Customer] ""OK, give me X 2nd."" [Agent] ""Mhm"" [Customer] ""Hello?"" [Agent] ""I am still here."" [Customer] ""Yes, I, I will have to consider it I will call you back"" [Agent] ""So what is there to consider?"" [Customer] ""But No, no, I, I switched, I switched before to a lower internet to To save money I do not want to pay more money Um, I know for a fact That my issue is not the internet because What We do not use here a lot of stuff. We just have a computer and and like X, like maybe XX cell phones, and that is it."" [Agent] ""That is a lot of that, that is a lot of stuff though."" [Customer] ""We do not."" [Agent] ""The one gig can hold up to XX devices, and each one of those cellphones is a device. So I mean, that, that is, that is quite a bit that you have connected on there."" [Customer] ""I am Help me out."" [Agent] ""What if I could bring it down to just an additional $61?"" [Customer] ""Listen, I have been with you since XXXX. I know you are not going to believe this when I had a gig, Two months ago, and now that I have, I do not know how much I have now, XXX or XXX or XXX, whatever I have now I have not seen any change in this field. The problem is that Either even if I have XGB or XGB. Maybe my location, it is in a weird spot and, or the router is set up in a weird spot that is not. Covering the whole place, and I, I even have an extender here. And it is"" [Agent] ""So you, you just said."" [Customer] ""Well, give me a good price. I will do it. Give me, what is the best you could give me, please?"" [Agent] ""I mean this, this is a good price."" [Customer] ""I."" [Agent] ""I mean $61 beforehand you were paying $377 for the services so I mean this is a good price"" [Customer] ""I know, I know. I know it is good. I know Uh, Yeah."" [Agent] ""We are upgrading your internet for you as well as getting you our connection back up. The connection back up itself runs $30 so you are actually getting the connection back up and then the X gig internet for $30. I do not know if there is much else I can do for you."" [Customer] ""I I know it is good. I know you can do a little bit better. It is, it is not even fiber, it is not even fiber optic. The, I have fiber optic with Optimum in my house I pay way less than here I have phone, TV, I."" [Agent] ""That is because you are, you are a residential customer, you are not a business customer at your home, but because those are totally two different services. But you just mentioned yourself that you have XX cell phones connected to the internet. You have got a computer. Do you have cameras within your business too to watch your all of your, uh, like your furniture and things within the business?"" [Customer] ""Yes"" [Agent] ""OK, so there is even more devices. So I mean you have a high internet need at your business, and like I said, we are giving it to you at an additional $60 where you used to pay an additional $110 and then you dropped the price down and now, so I mean we are."" [Customer] ""That is why I am not that is why I am not paying no more $110 because I could not afford it I switched for a lower payment It is not that Yeah, kind of, well, it does, I do not."" [Agent] ""But your business is suffering because of it."" [Customer] ""It is not really so, it is a matter of choice. It is Uh, we are watching TikTok videos."" [Agent] ""I mean The whole The whole thing with the internet is it is a faster upload speed."" [Customer] ""My, whatever I need this."" [Agent] ""It is the faster it is the faster time that you get to help your customers and you give them a better quality of service."" [Customer] ""I, I understand."" [Agent] ""So it is, it is not just like oh watching TikTok videos we do not care about that within a business we care about like how fast we can give the customer services."" [Customer] ""No, no, that is my point. If it, if it was really hurt, I know this is. You do not care about it, but if it is really damaging my business, I will pay XXX more. It is, if we want to, if we want it stronger and faster is because personal preferences, it is not. The business, we only use the internet to do applications, X applications a day. We do not use that much internet for customers. It is, it is a furniture store. Everything it is on display. So the internet it is for our personal preference I appreciate you giving me $60 only instead of $90 I, I appreciate. I am asking if you could help me a little bit more. I will appreciate."" [Agent] ""The only thing, the only thing I could do is remove our connection back up and I would not recommend that because uh you called in in the beginning of the conversation was your internet keeps dropping and it is not working for your business and so what I have done is I have."" [Customer] ""What does the connection back up does? Where, where does it take the. Where, where will it take the internet from the connection back then?"" [Agent] ""So if your internet drops out you have a power outage at this location, the internet turn this turns on to support your major devices, your cameras and your computers Um, it is going to make sure that your business can stay up and running no matter what kind of issues you face."" [Customer] ""OK, meaning like a little battery backup thing, that is what you mean?"" [Agent] ""It is a XG backup for your Internet."" [Customer] ""It does that, what does that do? Does that only turn on the router on if there is no electricity, the router will turn on, that is what it means?"" [Agent] ""So if your internet drops, if you have no internet, this turns on to support your internet. So no matter if there is a power outage an internet outage, you are still going to have internet within your store"" [Customer] ""Is that a hardware thing or that is uh an actual machine, an actual thing you bring?"" [Agent] ""It is an actual device."" [Customer] ""A device that I that I that the router is going to be plugged into it, correct?"" [Agent] ""Yes."" [Customer] ""So it is a battery backup, yes?"" [Agent] ""So it is not a battery backup because it is not a battery for your modem. It is a XG connection backup. So what it does is if your modem turns off,"" [Customer] ""Because I have, I have something here that I, I am sorry I, I have something here that I bought from you And I just, I am trying to figure out if it is the same thing that I that I already have or not. It is a little device where I plug I have plugged in my router"" [Agent] ""No."" [Customer] ""And when the internet goes out or the light, the electricity goes out, this is like a backup battery, which it turns on my router and it turns on my My devices."" [Agent] ""It turn that device is going to turn on your modem and keep your modem active so that you can still use hardwired internet. This is going to stay active even if you have no internet. Like even let us say for some reason all the lines around you get cut down you have no internet service through Optimum This turns on to support you with XG internet. We just started selling this product back in January. You can not buy it outright. It is something that we offer you as a product like a modem. Um, and so it is not what you currently have. This is something totally different."" [Customer] ""OK, it will support Wi Fi or only hardwire?"" [Agent] ""I believe both"" [Customer] ""OK, and if I remove it, how much will you save me?"" [Agent] ""$30.00 "" [Customer] ""So that means I will be paying XX only more?"" [Agent] ""Yes, but I do not recommend it because again the whole point when you first got on the phone with us was you wanted to upgrade your Internet because your Internet keeps dropping. This this device right here is to protect customers from their internet dropping, so I mean we can just do the connection back up and not do the upgrade and you can see if that works for you, um, but I mean I would not recommend getting rid of the connection back up we can, but in the end I feel like that is what is going to work best for your business."" [Customer] ""Give me X 2nd, hold on. I take my I No. So I am sorry to, I am sorry to keep asking. I just want to ask you something else. Let us say"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""The power, there is a power outage. The power outrage happened. The internet will, will start working. Good, perfect. But my credit card machine works. On the electricity, so my credit card machine will be off. So, will this device turn on my credit card machine as well, or will only provide me internet?"" [Agent] ""No, you would have to look into your credit card machine, uh, regarding any type of backup that is associated with them like a battery backup. This is just going to provide you internet if the power goes out you have an internet outage"" [Customer] ""Understood. I, I am really not going to need that. You could remove it. Just do the upgrade and we do not need the the backup internet. Because it is If I if if uh."" [Agent] ""I really recommend it because it is a big device that we are we are giving to all of our customers I understand where you are coming from, that your point of sale machine will not be on if and if the power is out how often do you see internet outages versus power outages"" [Customer] ""Uh, I thank God for the past year and a half I have not seen Either, you know, but it is possible that any could happen, yes, it is."" [Agent] ""OK, cause I mean when we got on the phone, you said your internet kept dropping out. And so is that not an internet outage?"" [Customer] ""No, no, I did not see my anything was dropping out. I said my internet is slow."" [Agent] ""OK, well then we can offer the X gig upgrade at an additional $31 I can have somebody come out tomorrow I have an X to XX or XX to X."" [Customer] ""Yeah, that is fine. That is perfect."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Thank you for your help."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""I really appreciate it."" [Agent] ""They will call you before they show. Thank you for calling and have a good day."" [Customer] ""Thank you, bye."""
Call178,"[Agent] ""Thank you for calling Optimum Business now offering Optimum Mobile. My name is Marcos. How can I assist?"" [Customer] ""Hi Marcos. Uh, my name is Cynthia. Um, I have a business that I would like to get optimum internet for. Um, currently we are AT&T customers. We are moving our office and um I think it may be a little bit easier for us to use Optimum because we already probably have cables in our office for Optimum."" [Agent] ""Yeah, I can find out for you, Cynthia. What is that address?"" [Customer] ""The address is XXX. 7th Street. Suite A. And that is Eureka, California XXXXX."" [Agent] ""Thank you. Let me take a look at this address. When do you plan on moving to this address?"" [Customer] ""Uh, the end of this week."" [Agent] ""OK, just so you know we can bring. Those do you have phone numbers with AT&T?"" [Customer] ""I do have a phone number with AT&T, yeah."" [Agent] ""We would be bringing that over, right?"" [Customer] ""Uh Uh, optimally, yes."" [Agent] ""OK, so when we port numbers from any company, it does not matter if it is AT&T, Verizon, whatever it is."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""It takes X to X business days for that company to release the number to us, so."" [Customer] ""OK. OK."" [Agent] ""If it was not for that. Chances are we will be there this week for sure maybe even tomorrow or Thursday, but because we are porting a number that could you know push it out to maybe Monday of next week or Tuesday."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Monday or something."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""All right, well, let us, uh, let us talk about the other stuff and we will work out the schedule."" [Agent] ""Yeah, OK, so, yeah, I have a lot of active customers here. I see EXXX, XXX, XXX. So it looks like a lot of people have been with us here, um, have active customers right now."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""Suite A is actually available. Looks like someone just left, um, beginning of March, so that is free for new customers. OK, so. Let me tell you the details of our service. There is no contract."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Everything is month to month. You can make changes at any point if you wish to add additional services, remove services, cancel services you could do so at any point, OK There is no extra charge or termination fees, nothing like that."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""OK, um, so tell me a little bit about the business or what you have with AT&T that way I know what package we could come up with."" [Customer] ""Well, we have really high speed internet actually I want to get the uh the sort of, I forget, I was looking at your website, so you have got like X different tiers, right Um. So I would like to get the lowest tier just start with that and see how that works for us. Um, we were back in XXXX, XXXX we are doing a lot of video streaming and stuff and so we had a higher speed, but we are not really doing that anymore so we can go with a lower speed."" [Agent] ""OK, yeah, so the lowest option I am sure if you are looking at it online it is in this area I believe it is the XXX speed, right?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, I think that is what it was. Sounds right, XXX. I think it was like XXX, XXX and X GB or something, right?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, one gig is, again, I, I am not sure what you are using it for, um, how many computers or laptops, what are, what are we using it for?"" [Customer] ""Well right now we have only got like one person working in the office with a laptop so it is mostly just used for, you know, backing up uh to the cloud so we do not we do not need super high speed we do not have anything streaming or anything"" [Agent] ""OK, OK, so if it is one. OK, so if we do the, the lowest tier or the. XXX speed. With one number. We would be looking at about. XXX. That is if you do auto pay."" [Customer] ""XXX."" [Agent] ""Yeah, that is with auto pay."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""If you do not wish to do auto pay, it is about XXX."" [Customer] ""OK. No, I want to do auto pay. It is just easier for me. You do not have to remember it every month."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""Um, yeah, that sounds, that sounds good."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""I think we are probably paying around XXX right now for the higher speed internet and we just, we are not doing enough to support that. So I think, uh, I think that XXX with uh one phone line transporting the number over is probably going to be good. Um, we also have uh a mobile phone that um can I, can I add that to the account?"" [Agent] ""100%. If you add an unlimited plan to that account. So let us say you are on auto pay with the XXX speed. And one landline, your bill is XXX with auto pay, right?"" [Customer] ""Mhm. Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""If you add a Unlimited mobile plan, you automatically save $15 off of your internet bill, which comes down to $90. Plus your mobile bill."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Your mobile bill is about $45. That is unlimited talk, unlimited text, unlimited data you have about X gigabytes of mobile hotspot"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So XX for your mobile, XX for your internet and landline."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Um, that is a great way to save some money."" [Customer] ""Mm. Yeah, so is that kind of typical or is that like a special offer that is limited time or what is that for the cell phone?"" [Agent] ""Um, I would not say it is limited time because that is just what the offers are when a customer, an optimum internet customer brings in a line, a mobile line, you get savings, OK?"" [Customer] ""Mhm OK."" [Agent] ""You get the most savings with the gig. I just want to give you an idea of what it would be with the gig, just so you have an idea."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Um."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""X gig with one landline comes out to XXX. You save $40 by being a mobile customer."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So that bill comes down to XXX."" [Customer] ""Oh."" [Agent] ""So you have X gigabyte and X landline for XXX. Plus XX for the unlimited plan, so all in you are at XXX plus tax, right?"" [Customer] ""That is at XXXX for the whole, the whole thing."" [Agent] ""Yes, just keep in mind, Cynthia."" [Customer] ""Yeah, so it is really not that."" [Agent] ""Yeah, it, it, it is, uh, keep in mind when you do mobile."" [Customer] ""OK"" [Agent] ""Um, it is a separate account and it has to be on autopay, but it is, you know, under the same umbrella because I link the two accounts together for your internet account to get the savings. So yeah, when you really come down to look at the numbers, right?"" [Customer] ""Oh, I see."" [Agent] ""X gig with uh the landline. And the mobile XXX, the XXX speed is what, XX XX, XXX, the price difference is $15. Just the thought, right? You save more with the gig when you do the mobile."" [Customer] ""Right, right, right, right, yeah, for sure, well, that makes the one you."" [Agent] ""I am not trying to, you know I am not trying to I am not trying to push you on the gig."" [Customer] ""Uh, no, I, I get it."" [Agent] ""It is just you know, XX bucks, you have the best of the best internet"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, absolutely, no, I get it. It kind of makes sense to go with the higher speed because it is not really that much different than the cost."" [Agent] ""Let us look at the XXX. We did not even do that one that is the middle tier."" [Customer] ""Mhm"" [Agent] ""Alright, so XXX plus. XXX plus the number. One sec. That is 1:15, XXX minus XX for being a mobile customer XX. you know, for $5 more you are getting the XXX speed. So yeah, let us."" [Customer] ""Yeah, well."" [Agent] ""The XXX speed you are at XX, the XXX speed XX, the gig XXX, and your mobile is always going to be XX."" [Customer] ""Right, right, right, right, OK."" [Agent] ""So"" [Customer] ""Um, I actually kinda want to think about adding the mobile, uh, give it a little bit of time."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""Um, can we just go ahead and arrange to do the XXX tier plus the phone line today?"" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""And um the thing is I am using my personal phone for the uh company phone at the moment and so um I am OK with doing that sort of for a while but not too much longer um I just I just need to get everything kind of moved and see how we are doing then I can make some upgrades Does that sound OK to you?"" [Agent] ""Of course it does, yes."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Let us get started."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I think that is what I would like to do."" [Agent] ""Alright Cynthia, are you going to be the main point of contact the account holder"" [Customer] ""Yes, I am, yes."" [Agent] ""C Y N T H I A."" [Customer] ""Perfect."" [Agent] ""What is your last name?"" [Customer] ""Rochell B as in boy, O S as in Sam, H as in Hank, E L L."" [Agent] ""OK, what is going to be the primary phone number for this account?"" [Customer] ""Um, are you asking for the phone number that I am going to move are you asking for a contact number"" [Agent] ""Mm. Contact number for the account."" [Customer] ""OK, so that would be my personal phone number that is XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Agent] ""OK, are you adding anyone else to this account such as an authorized user?"" [Customer] ""Um, Would that be like a secondary contact person or would that, oh that would be somebody else who is authorized to actually change the account correct?"" [Agent] ""Make a change, yeah, mhm, yeah, all I need is their name. I do not need their contact information because we would not call them, but if they call us we are able to talk to them about this account."" [Customer] ""Um, OK. OK, so that person uh would be Nam Doran I will spell that name for you It is N as in Nancy. A M as in Mary. And her last name is Doran. D as in dog, O. R Uh N as in Nancy."" [Agent] ""Thank you.

Just so you know when I enroll you, we do not collect the payment, we just enroll you Your first payment would be drafted about X weeks to X weeks after you got installed."" [Customer] ""Great. OK, perfect."" [Agent] ""OK, so I will get the date of when the number will be released to us. And then we will see when we can send the tech out as of now we have the XXX speed with one landline."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Auto pay would come out to XXX. There is a one-time installation fee, $100."" [Customer] ""OK. Mhm."" [Agent] ""You do not pay the technician, you do not pay today, that would be on your first bill, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK, so I will not be here next week I can have the landlord let you check in Will that be OK?"" [Agent] ""That is OK. As long as someone over the age of XX is able to tell the technician where to install, that is, that should be fine."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Does not have to be, yep, does not."" [Customer] ""OK, perfect. Can I put little notes on the wall to tell them what I want in each room?"" [Agent] ""What do you mean by each room? They are just installing a modem, right?"" [Customer] ""Well Oh, I guess. Oh, I guess it would be wireless. Is it, how does it work? Yeah, oh yeah, there is just installing the modem. OK. I do not know what I was thinking. I guess I was thinking plug in, um. Yeah, OK, never mind. Spring Parker. I thought it was back in XXXX.""

He will not have to be worrying about people like throwing down furniture around him and stuff. Him or her."" [Agent] ""Sounds like a good idea. That way your movers can work without having a technician. Um, in, uh."" [Customer] ""Yeah, it becomes kind of chaotic when everybody's trying to do everything all at once, so.""

You still have seasonal rates so I forgot, Ms. Marsha, where do they go when they have seasonal rates on their account?""

[Agent] ""OK, because the account that I am on, I am going to give you the account number. There is no fiber codes coming up and, and it says it is a one gig, so I do not even know. I am not going to say I do not know where he got that from a tech was there and told him that he could get fiber, but there is no there is not fiber at this location"" [Customer] ""OK, let me, I can look at it on footprint, but uh if you have already looked, you are probably telling us.""

[Agent] ""Now also he is saying that um that um never mind exactly that is never mind that is what the person said he was saying that OK here it is that they were asking him why he has coax if he has fiber, but I get it now because there were not any fiber codes on this account."" [Customer] ""Right, and then too it could be if you are in seasonal you can not have a seasonal account that is in fiber."" [Agent] ""Oh.""

[Agent] ""Mm mm."" [Customer] ""Let me see."" [Agent] ""Yeah, it says X reports are not available to place a fiber order please escalate the self support team using IDA escalation form and KDB.

[Customer] ""Right, right, so, uh, try and, and, uh, just type in fiber at the bottom and see what happens."" [Agent] ""Yeah, that is how I know it does not. I typed in fiber at the bottom nothing came up"" [Customer] ""OK, because I just updated the account."" [Agent] ""So you think maybe I need to wait a couple of minutes or something like that?""

[Customer] ""So but if they do not come up then you do escalate using KDB to have the fiber codes added."" [Agent] ""I forgot how to do that again. I mean, I know how to go into KDB and select the link, but do I still like do a order in coax or I just leave it?"" [Customer] ""Yes, you do your order in Coa."" [Agent] ""OK. And then escalate it"" [Customer] ""Yeah, you do not want nobody else to come in and uh-huh."" [Agent] ""Exactly. Now say that I do have to uh key it in coax what do I just schedule it a few days out so that I have time for it to be updated?"" [Customer] ""That is correct."" [Agent] ""OK. OK, good. Alright, let us see here."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And he wants X statics. Oh, is it OK to, to try it?"" [Customer] ""Yes, yes, you can try it."" [Agent] ""OK, let me try. Just waiting for IDA. I am in the account. I just want to modify services. OK, Ms. Marsh, I am just waiting for it to populate on the bottom I am just going to type in fiber and see"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""OK, so already has the static on here. Yeah, so the fiber codes did not come up. I am just going to key it. Uh, coax and then just give him the information and I will have it updated."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh. Correct."" [Agent] ""OK, alright, thank you, Miss Marcia."" [Customer] ""All right, you are welcome have a great evening."" [Agent] ""You too."" [Customer] ""Alright"" [Agent] ""Hey Josh."" [Customer] ""Come on."" [Agent] ""Sorry about that."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""I just was working with someone else too, uh, so yeah, I just tried to, I just try to go around this lomo and what is going to happen is I am going to set this up as coax and then I am going to have one of my colleagues input it as fiber. So what I am going to do is I am not going to give you the soonest date that we have because that is normally what everyone wants so I just want you to just, you know, if you do not mind just being patient with me, I am going to set everything up as coax and then what I am going to do is I am going to schedule it a few days out so that we can change the code so I am going to give you the pricing."" [Customer] ""Oh yeah. Mhm."" [Agent] ""And uh and everything for coax and then I am also going to obviously let you know how much is going to be fiber wise I am going to set this thing up"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I just ask that you just be patient with me over the next XX to XX hours so I can have everything updated."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Alright, so just bear with me a few moments as I said, I am going to set everything up and review it with you and then we will be good to go."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""Alright thank you."" [Customer] ""Sure."" [Agent] ""Now so I wanted to ask you, um, we usually have a promo for like radio stations and things of that nature, um, so that is what I am going to review with you now this is going to give you, uh, it is going to give you the Internet."" [Customer] ""Uh huh. Uh Mhm."" [Agent] ""It is going to give you, um, that those X static IPs so it is going to give you around the clock protection and support and things of that nature. The only thing I wanted to ask you, which, you know, because we are a telecommunications company, I just want to make sure you did not need that. You do not need like any um like TV. You are not looking for like cable or internet or like that, anything like that."" [Customer] ""Um, well, no, I do not need cable. I mean, I just need the, um, the internet."" [Agent] ""Well, yeah, you are just going to have internet and it comes with a phone line for like emergencies if you want like a fax or an emergency line that comes bundled in. I am just making sure you do not need TV."" [Customer] ""Yeah. No, no TV. It is the radio, not TV, yeah."" [Agent] ""Exactly, I figure you do not need that."" [Customer] ""OK Yeah, sure, I appreciate that, yeah."" [Agent] ""It sounds silly, but I we are telecommunications company I have to let you know just in case. Alright, you got it. So yeah, I am almost finished setting everything up I am going to see when we can get out to you Like I said, I am not going to schedule the soonest date until I get these codes situated for fiber. Once I get situated, I could possibly bump you up from whenever we schedule it."" [Customer] ""Um Yeah."" [Agent] ""All right, be right back. OK, so it is what we are looking at, we are looking at about XXX, and that is going to be with the X gig fiber, as I said, I am setting you up with coax so we can update those fiber codes. You are going to have the fastest internet available in your region."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, well, actually go ahead."" [Customer] ""Mhm. I am listening."" [Agent] ""Well, yeah, I was going to say actually the fastest would be an X gig but that would be, you know, overkill for your set up so we are going to give you the X gig fiber. It is going to give you asymmetrical, so your upload and download's going to be the same."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""This is going to absolutely blow the speed out of the water that, um, you know, you were trying that was normally in this area because you are going to be on fiber. You are going to have those X statics as well. As I said, it comes with that rollover line and it is going to come include a failover service which is going to make sure that you maintain phone and internet services even if it gets too windy, too hot, whatever, you know, you know, people are down in your area, you are going to remain up for at least X hours."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""It is going to be that failover service is going to kick in automatically. Now keep in mind, all your optimum services and devices, slowmo are covered 100%."" [Customer] ""You Uh, go ahead."" [Agent] ""So if you need any replacement, any tech support, anything like that, we enter in XX seconds or less."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""What people are not aware of is that not just optimum devices are covered."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So some people have flat screen TVs or cameras or other computer systems that are actually. Eligible to be covered by Optimum. So if you ever need to replace anything at all, a monitor or TV screen, just make sure you check in with us first to make sure it is not covered by, you know, make sure we cover it before you run out to the store and have to buy or purchase anything new."" [Customer] ""Sure. Mhm."" [Agent] ""Alright, now, uh, as I said, you are going to be at $195 even there is a one time install of XXX bucks now we do not collect any payment from you there is no payment due to the tech"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""What I am focused on right now is just getting the install set up so I can have those codes updated. But you are not going to be providing any payment. The only thing I am going to, uh, need from you is for for you to confirm and I am still waiting on those dates, is for you to confirm who is going to be on site for the installation."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""Are you going to be there?"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Someone else going to be there."" [Customer] ""Either be Me or the, or Neil the engineer or both."" [Agent] ""OK, I just need one. I mean, if both of you guys are good that is super too, so I just need one I have your contact information, so just give me about XX more seconds I will have those dates and times for you and I will set that up and like I said, if we need to set anything up a little sooner, I will keep in contact with you to set it up that way."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I mean, I would like to obviously the sooner the better, you know."" [Agent] ""Right, it is just that you know what it is? I want to delay it a little bit because I want those codes to be updated. I do not want them to to be gung ho and set up an install, and then they are coming to set up coax and we really need them to do, um, fiber."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""So it is it is not like, um, it is just a technical thing that I have to resolve the department I need is actually closed That is why I was not able to do it right now."" [Customer] ""Oh."" [Agent] ""So I am going to set everything up and I am going to get with them first thing in the morning."" [Customer] ""Right. Mhm. Sure."" [Agent] ""Alright, and then I can update everything sooner if needed."" [Customer] ""Right, totally."" [Agent] ""All right, OK, so I will be right back thank you sir. Hey Slowmo, uh, do you have any availability on the weekend?"" [Customer] ""On Saturday, no, but Sunday, yeah."" [Agent] ""XX, you are available on Sunday. Sunday I have X. I have Sunday the 18th. I have X to XXXX to X I have X to X."" [Customer] ""Yeah, X to X."" [Agent] ""Alright, let us get you set up for that X to X, and what is going to happen is the text they will call you XX minutes in advance so they will be able to speak with you or the engineer or whomever to let you know they are coming, um, just confirm the best contact number Slomo."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I sent this number XXX. XXXXXXX"" [Agent] ""Beautiful, so that is XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Alright beautiful so you are scheduled for Sunday you said XX to X, right?"" [Customer] ""No, no, X to X."" [Agent] ""X to X, my apologies. What am I thinking? It is Sunday. Alright, so Sunday it is going to be uh X to X as I said I am going to submit everything just to have these codes turned over and everything um, you are going to be good to go. There is now keep in mind there is no payment due today there is no payment due to the tech We just want the tech to come through, do his job. He is going to be in and out unless you guys have any questions or any kind of preferences, of course you can review that with them, but other than that the tech's not going to be looking for payment"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""They are just going to set you up with your fiber and then they are going to be out of there."" [Customer] ""Right. So they are going to run everything and install the modem, the works."" [Agent] ""The works, the gateway, the router, the modem, they are going to set you up to be good to go. As I said, this does come with a rollover line. You guys can do whatever you want with that. You are going to have your protection and support your fail over. So just keep in mind the tech is installing everything. You are not going to need to hold a hammer or a wrench you know, give him a beer or anything They are going to set everything up, minimum downtime or none, and then they are going to get out of there."" [Customer] ""Right, that is great. And what, what, what, tell me about the rollover line. How does that work?"" [Agent] ""Now the roll over, I, as I said, what people do is your line, your phone line, people use it if uh if they already have like a phone set up. So some most people use it for a fax or an alarm system, but other people say they already have like say people call in, um, however they call into the station, you now will have a roll over line so that you can plug in any phone you want and you can now receive calls on that one too."" [Customer] ""Go on. Right. I got you. OK, I got I appreciate you."" [Agent] ""So yeah that is just going to come along with your service now keep in mind though, and this is something that you may be interested in, you guys are eligible and I see you guys have not taken advantage of it.

[Customer] ""And XXXX."" [Agent] ""Thank you. I see you also have a pending trouble call for today between X and X."" [Customer] ""Yes, yes, we have had drops yesterday and today and so I was, I have been trying to upgrade for quite a while but we have had another software that was had conflicts that we had to deal with first, um."" [Agent] ""OK. Mhm. Mm."" [Customer] ""So I thought, well, we are going to have to get a new modem and I asked if what about upgrading and of course they they told me that um. X gig right now is like XXX and XXX is like. Uh, $30 more than what we are paying or something like that, um. And back in January and and even last year I kept getting these ads for um. Um, XGB for $200 per month for the X year contract."" [Agent] ""Yeah, those are like acquisition offers yeah."" [Customer] ""And I do not expect I do not know if that is uh anything I can get close to I would settle for paying just a little bit more um is there any way to get X gig at the XXX $500 price"" [Agent] ""Let me take a look to see if there is a better rate."" [Customer] ""To the OK, that'd be great."" [Agent] ""What is the best rate I can get you one gig at, OK? Hold on one moment, I am going to place you on a brief hold. Should this call drop for any reason, can I reach you back at the XXX-XXX-XXXX?"" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""Alright, hold on one second, Ms. Martin."" [Customer] ""OK"" [Agent] ""Thank you so much for your patience. So you actually do have a couple of options if you want to upgrade to a gig, we do have a promotional offer where it would only be a difference of $65 from what you are currently paying."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So if you want to upgrade to the X gig, it would be $285 will be your new monthly rate. Again, that is $65 more than what you are currently paying. It is free for the tech to come out and swap out your modem, get the new modem for X gig, and if you want to do even more savings than that, I do not know, um, who do you guys use for a mobile phone? Who is your mobile provider?"" [Customer] ""AT&T, I mean, but it."" [Agent] ""Are you, are you on the contract of financing your device with AT&T?"" [Customer] ""No, and I do not want to be either. It is mainly a family family thing with the company, um, I do not think we will be changing because he just, he just got a new phone and he ordered it yesterday, so."" [Agent] ""OK. Well, hear me out. You hear me out on the offer that way before you just shut it down, just know what is available to you, right? If you decided to bring over a mobile line, right, our mobile plan is an unlimited text and talk plan."" [Customer] ""OK. Mhm."" [Agent] ""You can keep your existing device as well as your number. No contracts are required, right? The mobile plan itself is $45 you would get an additional $40 off of that price So instead of your rate going up $65 XXGB, it would only be a difference of $25 your mobile plan would only be $45"" [Customer] ""OK, I do not, I do not think I would even talk him into that."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Um, XXX for X gig though, and that is."" [Agent] ""Mhm. So XX month offer, no contract free for the tech to come out. Services include protection and support through Asurion. It includes, um, like I said, it includes a new modem for X gig, and there is no charge for the tech to come out to swap out your modem because it would have to be swapped out."" [Customer] ""OK. OK, they are coming out today to do that because we are having these problems the technical"" [Agent] ""today they are coming up for trouble call. This would actually be um an upgrade order I have availability as early as Thursday, which is tomorrow"" [Customer] ""No She, she said they would replace she said that they would replace my modem because it is old and that is probably the problem."" [Agent] ""Right. What I mean is a replacement modem is only going to sustain the modem that you currently have."" [Customer] ""That is not what she said."" [Agent] ""Like for XXX megabytes."" [Customer] ""She said we call back in , OK, well, she said I could call back in This modem would cover XXX or XX gig. I will have to just call back in and tell them what we want to upgrade. So can we get that fixed before they come out here?"" [Agent] ""Unfortunately, yeah. No, you would not be able to do that before, like, because your modem is not compatible for it. It is going to make me schedule order either way. There is no charge for the tech to come out I would have to schedule the appointment"" [Customer] ""OK Uh, I am totally confused, but that is OK, um."" [Agent] ""I am not sure why anybody would tell you, you know that the modem because the tech, like most of the times when you are not upgrading your services, the techs are only going to bring you out equipment to sustain what you currently have"" [Customer] ""OK, so the Mhm."" [Agent] ""That is, that is protocol. We are not, they are not going to give you a gig modem for XXX megabytes speed because it again what is the purpose of it? They are not, you know, the modems typically match what the customer has as far as the service is rendered so I do not know why young lady will even give you that information"" [Customer] ""OK. OK. But she, she might Yeah, they probably just did not know for something she is very sweet, um."" [Agent] ""Right."" [Customer] ""Anyhow, that'd be fine."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""We let the X, let us do the XXX."" [Agent] ""Alright, knock out somebody out there tomorrow."" [Customer] ""XXXX months XX months, right?"" [Agent] ""XX months, no contract, no contract."" [Customer] ""No contract, is that what you said? OK."" [Agent] ""XX months, no charge for the tech to come out. We have between XX and X tomorrow."" [Customer] ""And that'll work."" [Agent] ""What is the best number they can call when they are on their way?"" [Customer] ""And, uh, XXX, you want something to text you or you want something to call?"" [Agent] ""for the tech, you know, when the tech is en route, you know."" [Customer] ""OK, but would he rather text would he rather call"" [Agent] ""I will reach out to? It is up to you."" [Customer] ""OK, um, Hold just give him this number XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Agent] ""That is XXX-XXX-XXXX correct?"" [Customer] ""Yes, and there is not a way to catch this tech today and tell him to bring the other modem?"" [Agent] ""No, again, because the, the way they have your order in right now is for trouble call. Trouble call and sales upgrades to two different teams."" [Customer] ""OK OK, I got you."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""OK"" [Agent] ""Alright, I will send you an email to confirm this before I complete this. Do you have any other questions or concerns?"" [Customer] ""No, I keep thinking, where's the catch, because there is always a catch with these things you are saying there is no con no contract and XX months, X gig"" [Agent] ""Yeah, just to give you a quick recap, just to give you a quick recap, there are no contractual obligations."" [Customer] ""Mhm OK."" [Agent] ""You can upgrade, downgrade, cancel, or indifferent. There are no penalties to do so. There is no charge for the technician to come out and set services up. It is a difference of $65. Your new monthly rate will be $285. Your tax will be $1.50. So the total price, including tax, is $286.50. This will include a new modem. The rate will be good for XX months. On the 23rd month we do send notification by way of your statement to let you know that the promotional discount is coming to an end. If we have a renewal option or different promotions available for you at that time, we will be more than happy to assist you with that at that point."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""You are not obligated if you do not like the rates, what have you you want to cancel, change, or indifferent There are no penalties. Services include protection and support through Asurion for additional technical support should you need it. And that is everything all of our calls are recorded for quality assurance as well Once again, my name is Rashaw, so I do not want you to think there are any catches with the offer. I want to be as transparent as possible with you."" [Customer] ""OK, I got it thank you very much."" [Agent] ""Alright, you are welcome."" [Customer] ""Alright."" [Agent] ""Is there anything else that I can assist you with today?"" [Customer] ""No, and you have got my email address right?"" [Agent] ""Yes, the email we have is E Martin at XStar.com is that the one?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah Yes, yes, that is correct, uh-huh."" [Agent] ""OK, alright, you are all set.""

[Customer] ""OK, well, yeah, I need internet phone service and phone service."" [Agent] ""Of course, yes. OK."" [Customer] ""Um, I am not sure if I am going to need TV as well, most likely yes."" [Agent] ""It it is cheaper if you bundle the package with the with the TV services. um, I just want to know what type of channels are you looking for, uh, you know, whether it is for yourself or for your, your clients."" [Customer] ""Well, I guess I just need general um maybe local channels for the clients when they sit in, you know, to watch some TV like that."" [Agent] ""OK. Got you. Yeah, of course, but, and nothing crazy, right? You just want to be able to have a good balance of like some local news channels, maybe a TV show or something to keep them occupied while they are waiting."" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""OK perfect. All right. So I am looking at the market that you are in Theodora, and what that means is. Certain markets will get certain speeds. You happen to be in our one gig market which means that uh let us see according to the map that I am looking at right now about."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, about 80% of the businesses in your area are using our X gig speeds so you will, you will be able to very quickly get service, uh, with that speed and, um Based on what you told me about the channels that you are going to look for, uh, you are going to need the choice package, right? The choice package is, uh, a healthy blend of your local news, a couple of like international news like uh Fox or CNN, MSNBC, um, and then, you know, get a couple of shows too, nothing, nothing too crazy, um, but like your local shows, right? It is a very basic package, um. You will have one box unless you needed more than one box, Theodore."" [Customer] ""Mm. And when you mean one box like for your TV box?"" [Agent] ""Yeah yeah like if you have more than one television I will be happy to provide you with a box for each television because sometimes our businesses they do not want the same thing on every television they may want to have news in one area and maybe something for the."" [Customer] ""Um,"" [Agent] ""Kids in another area, you know what I mean? or just like a bar, you know, different sports on different TVs."" [Customer] ""Mm."" [Agent] ""So in your case, Theodora, if you did have more than one TV, I am happy to provide you with a box for each one of them so you can kind of customize your customer experience."" [Customer] ""Yeah, no, just one."" [Agent] ""OK. And you said that you will need just one phone line correct?"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Perfect. OK. Let us see here, um, OK, sure, sure, yeah."" [Customer] ""Question Is this something that I should set up or leave that to my IT team so they could determine how much um services do I need."" [Agent] ""Well this is something you can easily set up um I could ask you just a couple of questions to make sure that you are getting the appropriate speed uh so that way we are not giving you too much we are also not giving you too little um so for example, Theodora Off the top of your head, it does not have to be an exact number how many computers do you think are going to be used during um your most busiest time"" [Customer] ""Mm."" [Agent] ""How many do you think?"" [Customer] ""No X."" [Agent] ""OK, now these computers, do you know if um they include laptops or tablets or are they just regular like desk computers?"" [Customer] ""Desk and lap."" [Agent] ""OK, so, so it is a mix, uh, X total devices, some of them laptops, some of them desktops OK, OK, now, um, how about like your cell phone, for example, right"" [Customer] ""Yes. Mm Mhm."" [Agent] ""Are you going to connect to the Wi Fi on your cell phone?"" [Customer] ""Oh yeah, for sure."" [Agent] ""OK, so that is going to be X devices. Um, if there is anyone else that will be doing that same thing, I know not all of the employees will be allowed to connect to the business Wi Fi, but maybe management or something like that tend to have that access so we have X devices right now um, given that this is an accounting business, uh, I am going to assume Theodora that you do have like a wireless printer of some sort over there"" [Customer] ""Mm. Yeah, I will need um wireless printer and it will not be only my cell phone to be connected."" [Agent] ""Yeah. Mhm."" [Customer] ""But um also be available to the other employees if needed."" [Agent] ""That is really nice of you. Um, you know, I have had previous employers that were very, very strict and said, no, you can not use our internet. I do not care what the situation is, uh, so I think it is lovely that you provide that ability for your employees. Um, so now, so now we are looking at potentially XX or more devices that are connected to the Internet, so I am definitely going to suggest that you take advantage um of the X gigabyte speed just like the other businesses in your area are doing, um, this will allow for your business to function very smoothly, um, and do you have a credit card machine there?"" [Customer] ""Mhm. Right."" [Agent] ""Like for like a point of sale system for for your customers?"" [Customer] ""Um, Yeah, we will have one as well."" [Agent] ""Oh yeah, yeah, you are, you are definitely going to need the X gigabyte speed and I know for a fact your IT team will agree with that, um."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""And I am assuming that in the building or maybe on the outside of the building there is security cameras too."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""OK, alright, so yeah, you, you, you will need the X gigabyte speed in order for your business to function and the cameras to like really do their job. Um,"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""OK, let me see here. So there, there are no contracts here, Theodora. You do not have to worry about getting locked into something."" [Customer] ""Mm Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, there are no cancellation fees. There is no early cancellation fee either. So let us say you have our services for X or X months and then you cancel them, there is no penalty for that, um. What we will do is we will give you a promotional price. It will be a X year promotion that'll be $229 a month that is going to include your internet, your TV, your phone line the box, all the hardware, everything is included There is no like hidden fees or anything like that, um, and let us see if there is anything else that I am missing here that I could provide for you, but it seems like. You are getting the best deal that we could offer, so give me one more moment, Theodore. Did you have, um, uh, uh, a time frame that you were looking to get this installed by? Like was there a date that you were moving into this location are you already there"" [Customer] ""Um, I have um some individuals doing some work. Like, um, doing the floors, painting."" [Agent] ""Mhm. OK, OK."" [Customer] ""Um You know, start doing some upgrades in there um to the facility at the office and then."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""So basically, If should be done within this week. I, I am, I am told."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""So I do not know if"" [Agent] ""Well"" [Customer] ""It has to be the work done before going in or it could be during, during the time."" [Agent] ""Just Mm. Well that is a great question I will tell you what the best part about optimum technicians doing the installation is that we do not need the business to be completely finished and renovated before we can install your services It is actually kind of better for you to install the services while this work is getting done because um let us say that. There is a specific area that you want to have the, the cable boxes or the modem, right? for your internet, you can then tell the technician where to put it and then have your, your, your uh construction crew, right?"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""The people that are doing your painting and whatnot, they can work around that to make it look like, like almost it belonged there, you know, like, like it is not obvious that somebody came in after like it looks like it was put together."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I, I guess in a way that that makes it look like it was supposed to be there, you, you know what I mean? So, um, this is actually a good time to get it installed while that work is getting done. um, now technically speaking, Theodora, we can be there as soon as tomorrow um we do have availability, uh I do not want to paint you into a corner, um, you know, if there is any other day, uh, please let me know and I am, I am happy to let to to work with you"" [Customer] ""OK. I think Friday would be best."" [Agent] ""OK, so Friday is going to be the 16th. Now we do have X to XX we have X to X p.m., so we have X to XX in the morning and X to X in the afternoon Theodora, which works best for you?"" [Customer] ""X to X."" [Agent] ""Excellent. OK, and what I am going to do, Theodore is I am going to leave you as the point of contact for our technician when they are on their way, uh, if that is OK with you."" [Customer] ""Absolutely."" [Agent] ""Perfect. OK, and just to confirm, the best number they could reach you is area code XXX-XXX-XXXX, correct?"" [Customer] ""XX, yes."" [Agent] ""Yes, perfect. OK, so I have you all set up for uh this installation, but. Because this message is flashing on my screen to inform you if I do not tell you this Theodore, I, I will get in a little bit of trouble. So, um, this particular zip code XXXXX is eligible for additional discounts if the business owner."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, like, like your cell phone that we are talking on right now, if you bring your cell phone over to Optimum Mobile, what happens is you get discounts on your, your, your bill here, right? So you know it is uh $229 right now you can get up to $40 off just by bringing two phone numbers over. So that'll be $229 minus $40 so your bill will be $189. You can keep your phone. You can keep your phone number, and the best part is those lines will be just $25 a month. Normally those phone lines are $45 a month, but the promotion in your zip code, Theodora, means that. Of that $45 you get a $20 discount on that so that makes the phone line just $25 a month and that that discount gets applied as a credit on your bill and if you have two phone lines, it could be $40 discounts and you can have two phone lines that are just $25 a piece. Just putting that out there so you know um if you have anyone in the business or even yourself right that that you wanted to take advantage of this offer, you are more than welcome to"" [Customer] ""But do not I get a, a line, a phone line for the business?"" [Agent] ""Oh no you do yes you do for the business you do yes that that is going to be a traditional phone line but let us say um yourself if you have if you are married or if you have any children and you have a family plan and you decided, uh, you know, I want to save some money well we can bring your lines over we are powered by the T-Mobile network and Optimum hotspots so you are covered like twice, um, and if you do that."" [Customer] ""I am with T-Mobile already."" [Agent] ""Oh well look at that so you are going to use the same network you are going to pay like more than half the price I am not sure what you are paying per month per line, but I am pretty sure it is not, you know, $25 for like yourself and someone else."" [Customer] ""Mm, it is a lot more."" [Agent] ""Mm I know I am unfortunately a Verizon customer. Uh, I do not want to say unfortunately because I, I do not want to speak bad about our competitors, but, but I am paying significantly more and when my contract is up, I have every intention of switching over to Optimum Mobile, um, it, it is just, it is a no brainer really, um, and that is something I could take care of for you really quickly, but I do not want to pressure you. it is just something that, uh, that I needed to tell you because you are eligible for that discount."" [Customer] ""Yeah, um, This is another, I use this number for another business, so I can not bring this over to this one."" [Agent] ""OK. No problem."" [Customer] ""So. I need to have um, I do need to have another in um like mobile device for the this company for and the accounting"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""So if I could get that, that would be helpful as well."" [Agent] ""Yeah, absolutely, um, so let me ask you if if you have, uh, let us see here, the phone that you have currently right? the one that. Well, actually let me see here so you are there is no other phone that you can use to just bring over. I, I just want to save you some money and have you avoid you know, having to buy another phone Um, we do have an Optimum business mobile device. It is by Motorola. It is Android and it is only $129. So that is, uh, uh, you know, if you, if you want to purchase that phone, great, um, if you wanted to see about another phone, I can help you out with that. And if there was a device you already had, I can certainly get that one hooked up that is actually the the the cheapest way to go."" [Customer] ""I do have another device that I could use."" [Agent] ""Do you have it with you now? Because I am happy to check if uh if it is compatible with the network and if it is I think all it is going to cost is like $20 and some change to to get it activated like the activation fee."" [Customer] ""OK, hold on, let me, let me see if I can get a handle that."" [Agent] ""Yeah, sure, no problem, take your time, of course."" [Customer] ""Can you hold? OK. OK, hello?"" [Agent] ""Yes, I am here."" [Customer] ""OK. Um. So what kind of information would you need? That to give you."" [Agent] ""Uh, well, all I would need is the IMEI number. Is that an iPhone you have or is that a different device?"" [Customer] ""That is the Moto G. XXXX."" [Agent] ""Oh OK excellent."" [Customer] ""Some on the home."" [Agent] ""You know what is funny is that that is the same device except we have the XXXX version that is the same device I was going to suggest to you that was the $129.01. How funny is that? So you basically have the same phone for free."" [Customer] ""Um,"" [Agent] ""That that is wonderful. Alright, so yes, all I would need is the IMEI number, and I am happy to assist you with that if you needed some help finding that."" [Customer] ""Um, Oh God, I could barely see."" [Agent] ""It is OK."" [Customer] ""It is just crazy. Uh, I am blind. Just getting old is not easy."" [Agent] ""Mm. No problem. Let me pull this up for you really quick hold on."" [Customer] ""Yeah. So you want IME, you said?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, the IMEI number."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""So if you let me see here um."" [Customer] ""It is XXX."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""I XXX. Mhm XXX-XXX-XXXXXX."" [Agent] ""Take your time. Mhm. OK, X alright. And uh was there a phone number that you wanted to put on that device or? Um, Was there something else? Like, would you want a new number on that on that phone a new phone number"" [Customer] ""Uh, no. Uh, it, I will need a new phone number because I do not have a number to it. I have not even used it. I just have it."" [Agent] ""That is wonderful. So it is, it is literally like a brand new phone that uh you, you, you, this is probably the best situation for you a brand new phone that you that you do not have to pay twice for, um, you get it on the T-Mobile network for more than half the price this is incredible XXX-XXX OK, so right now I am just going to put this together for you. So you could take advantage of the savings, bear with me one moment. Um, Theodora, I will need that tax ID number one more time if you do not mind."" [Customer] ""OK, it is XXX-XXXXXX."" [Agent] ""OK. Mhm. Perfect XX-XXXXXXX."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""Perfect. OK. Yeah, it is compatible with our network we are going to get you a new phone number."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""OK, would you like to have insurance on the phone? It is only $7 a month. It covers cracked screens. You get next day replacements, tech support, you know, the, the whole thing that you would normally get with T-Mobile but for less money, $7 a month."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I know."" [Agent] ""OK, no problem. I, I will opt out of that for you right now. You do have XX days to change your mind, so that is, that is not an issue."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""OK, so Let us see here, there, there really was not any other phone number that we could put on here for you because if you wanted a new phone number we would just have to have you pay the first month up front. So all that would be due today I think would be uh. Let me see here. Including the activation fee and the taxes, yeah, all that would be due is just the XXXX and and then that would be it."" [Customer] ""OK, XX."" [Agent] ""XX, yep."" [Customer] ""XX."" [Agent] ""Alright. So give me one moment."" [Customer] ""And I get a new number?"" [Agent] ""Oh yes you do. And, and you know what? I will be able to give you that phone number while we are on the line right now if you just give me a few moments, I will be able to confirm that for you."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Give me one moment."" [Customer] ""Do I need a SIM card for the, the number to be uh in this phone?"" [Agent] ""Uh, no, actually, the beautiful part, and that is a great question. The beautiful part is that um the regular physical SIM card is being phased out. Everything is now digital, electronic.

[Customer] ""No, trust me, my boss is uh. Mm I say no more."" [Agent] ""Got you. Right, right, um, so it seems like it is very, very minimal there, um."" [Customer] ""Mhm.""

[Agent] ""Right, right, right, OK, uh, understood."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, And do you guys use your mobile phones for the business at all?"" [Customer] ""Um, he uses phone like if he is going to be at the office, he transferred the phone line to his phone."" [Agent] ""Does it to his cell phone? OK, cool, good to, good to know, um."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""Because you do qualify for additional discounts when you bundle in mobile, so if he wanted to bundle in, uh, bring his mobile phone over from Verizon to Optim or if he has Verizon, um, whoever he has."" [Customer] ""No. Oh, I do not know what phone he has we do want to transfer our office number"" [Agent] ""Right."" [Customer] ""Well that office number, uh, to."" [Agent] ""Right, so we could definitely get you, we could definitely get your office number from Verizon to Optimum for the office there."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Uh, what I am referring to is if you wanted to bring his mobile number over from his current company over to Optimum Mobile we connected to the account for Hamiltonian Garden since he does use his cell phone for business purposes, this could be a good opportunity for him to save some money not only on his internet account for"" [Customer] ""My boss is not going to do that and I do understand but he just also renewed his contract so he will not be out of his contract and I do not think he wants to do that mhm."" [Agent] ""Really? Right. Understood, understood. So what I would just ask of you, uh, Carlene is just to kind of pass over that info because you never know, he may, he may be like, oh, I can save this amount of money if I just do this, and you know it could be a win-win for him, um."" [Customer] ""I will. Mhm. OK, I will."" [Agent] ""He sounds like the type of guy who would love to save money anywhere he can."" [Customer] ""OK, he, he does, he does."" [Agent] ""Cool, um, so you know, with all that being said, you being in the basement, uh, even though you are a minimal operation down there, you said that he would like to have a high speed internet for those purposes."" [Customer] ""Mm."" [Agent] ""So this is what I recommend, um."" [Customer] ""Yeah Mhm."" [Agent] ""So where's my sheet here? It just automatically pops up and then like it kind of disappears on me. Um, so, um, I recommend going with X gig. So that is going to be the, the top tier internet here. X gigabit internet that is XXXX megabits on the download speed, um, with that phone line that you are going to bring over from Verizon, um, you are only looking at uh."" [Customer] ""Uh huh"" [Agent] ""Hold on one second. Where did that go? You are only looking at XXX monthly, which is fairly inexpensive for X gig and a phone line. It is pretty much on par with you know, everybody else in the industry right now giving a gig away for XXX bucks, um, and then you are getting the phone line uh at a discount there So it would be $110 monthly, um, well that is when you, that is when you sign up for auto pay paperless billing."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, otherwise it is $115 so you do get a $5 discount for signing up for auto pay and saving some trees at the same time, um then if you wanted to go with the XXX speed tier which is our middle tier, and this is, this is the lowest I would recommend you going because we do offer XXX megabits, but"" [Customer] ""OK. Uh Mhm."" [Agent] ""Since you are in the basement, it is not going to, it is not going to go well for you. I can tell you that right now. Uh, and we do not want your, um you know, your boss getting all upset with the internet connection"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So if you were to do the XXX speed, if you want to save a couple bucks, it is not that big of a difference, um, so that is. Uh, $100.02 year price guarantee, no contract. So honestly for the extra $10 you get twice the internet speed."" [Customer] ""OK, uh, question two, what if we do not do the phone line and just, uh, do the Internet?"" [Agent] ""Mhm. Um, it is so the, so all of our, uh, packages are set up in a double player or a triple play configuration, yeah, so the phone line is included, so you might as well just go with it, uh, yeah."" [Customer] ""How much would that cost? XX, OK, OK. You will go ahead and use it. OK, do me a favor can you send me that package, uh, information in my email so I can let her know?"" [Agent] ""So I can send you an email. What I would like to do, Carlene, um, it is because there is no contract with Optimum, obviously you can always make changes at any time."" [Customer] ""Mhm Mhm. OK."" [Agent] ""What I would recommend is we because our calendar does fill up quite quickly, especially since we are in the middle of May already, if you want to do this sooner than later."" [Customer] ""Uh huh"" [Agent] ""Let us get you on the schedule and make an appointment. You do not have to stick to stick to it."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""If your, if your boss does not like the, the deal, obviously just get in touch with me directly we cancel the appointment"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""It is just as easy as that, but if everything is cool and he is like, yeah, let us go with it, the appointment's already set up, um, and then you have to worry about it."" [Customer] ""Oh. OK, uh, one second, let me do this real quick."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Or if you want to just send them a message like, hey."" [Customer] ""And that is what I am doing now, um I know she is not going to answer me right away but um let us see"" [Agent] ""XXX. Right, well, at least, at least you know if she does say yeah cool let us go, you do not have to worry about calling me back or or you know missing out on a certain day because the calendar is full, you know what I mean?"" [Customer] ""Uh huh. OK"" [Agent] ""So you do that I will set this up quick"" [Customer] ""Uh, See Um Let us see um. So if we set up auto pay it would be XXX right?"" [Agent] ""XXX XXX without the auto pay."" [Customer] ""OK, one second, I am sorry, hold on a second please."" [Agent] ""Go for it, take your time."" [Customer] ""Mhm. I am sorry."" [Agent] ""It is OK, Carlene. Thank thanks for coming back."" [Customer] ""I wish people would read their contract."" [Agent] ""Uh."" [Customer] ""Oh my God, they drive me nuts. Uh"" [Agent] ""You know it is one of those things where it is just like yeah let me just check and agree to the terms and conditions and then it is just like hey wait a second."" [Customer] ""Uh Now when it comes to lease and stuff like that you got, you, you have to read it you you know you can not rely on people, um."" [Agent] ""Oh, of course. My, uh, my apartment lease, um, I live in Brook I live in Brooklyn, and the lease that they give us is like, it is like XX pages long."" [Customer] ""Uh huh Oh Ours is only X, but it is on legal paper."" [Agent] ""It is, it is like it is, it is no, it seems, I mean it seems like it is XX pages, but like, but like it might even be just XX pages, but it is front and back and there is like, you know, rules for, for, you know, gates on the windows or lead paint."" [Customer] ""It is basic, yeah. Right. Oh, I am, I am sorry, honey, can you hold on a second again for me please?"" [Agent] ""Of course Carline, no, no, go ahead, go ahead."" [Customer] ""I am sorry, hold on. OK, I am sorry."" [Agent] ""It is OK, do not apologize, you are fine, um."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, so you were saying they give you XX pages, but you know what, even with my apartment complex, they highlight the most important things, you know, that, that is very important and one of them is the noise."" [Agent] ""I Right, right, right, right. Mhm."" [Customer] ""Uh, another is to clean your area, you know, uh, uh, because I am like it is, it is almost like a garden apartment, so you can clean the front and the back, you know, they tell you what your, uh, late fees are, you know, stuff like that."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Right, right, right, right, right. Mhm. Right."" [Customer] ""They, they highlight it as well as."" [Agent] ""I grew up in um, I grew up in Garden Apartments when I was um in Queens so I am definitely familiar with that sort of situation"" [Customer] ""Yeah, right, right, so you know, uh, uh, a lot of them do not do that, and it is funny because I tell you the situation. I live on the first floor."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""My mom lives with me because she is, you know, at that age I help take care of her"" [Agent] ""Sure."" [Customer] ""And you know we have the people upstairs and I swear it is like a lot of people do not have common sense."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Now, this woman is a teacher. She does, she teaches high school kids, OK?"" [Agent] ""Right."" [Customer] ""I might not be the smartest cookie, OK I do have common sense, right"" [Agent] ""Right."" [Customer] ""So. You know, I was nice. She moved in a month, uh, so, you know, I spoke to the, uh, um, the management property there, so I tell her, you know, they are making too much. She is like, oh, they, they, they are really nice, you know, they are just we give them some time. I said, OK, so like after two months now I am thinking you are in and you know everything is fine, but she has a daughter and they walk like a cow, both of them."" [Agent] ""Right."" [Customer] ""OK, they walk like a cow and so I went up there and I said to her, you know, um, you know, I know you are just moving, but you know, you know, you are walking, it, it really wakes me up."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""I am a very light sleeper. Not only that, she has two cats you know how cats are"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""They run from room to room and you hear in the chicken tika across because it is hardwood floors. It is not even carpet."" [Agent] ""Right, right."" [Customer] ""And I am like I went up there and I knocked and you know, and, and so the mother answered the door, um her mother answered the door and she said, well, I do not hear the cat. No, of course you do not hear the cat. You are dead asleep, you know, you are not going to hear it."" [Agent] ""Right."" [Customer] ""So you are not on the, you are on the bottom listening to all of this. Everything goes fine, so we, you know, that I will not say type she gave me her phone number I gave her mine and instead of running upstairs all the time to tell her, please pipe down, you know, uh, so I text her, right, so I text her here is the thing, I text her, she does not answer until the next day and then"" [Agent] ""You just send a text. Uh,"" [Customer] ""Um, she will go, oh, I was busy, so I was not able to answer or it was too late so I did not answer."" [Agent] ""Uh, give me a break."" [Customer] ""OK, so I am like this is ridiculous."" [Agent] ""Mm."" [Customer] ""So the last time I said now she start working part time because now the rent is just going up, going up, so she is a single mom and she can not afford it, so she needs a part time job."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""The mother comes over she babysits on the weekend The mother walks like a freaking cow also. The dad walked like a freaking cow."" [Agent] ""Mhm"" [Customer] ""You know so I sent her a text I said, you know, your daughter is off the chain.

[Customer] ""Mhm. Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, normally that happens when like say like the, the, how do we call it we call it a um. Uh, what is the term? Sometimes when you have a phone number at a different location and you want to port it over to a new location, sometimes the oh the rate center is different when it comes to dialing up to XXX."" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""Um, so you sometimes you can not bring over numbers anywhere. It has to be a certain area code in the first three digits that actually actually means something."" [Customer] ""Right Right."" [Agent] ""I never knew that."" [Customer] ""Uh yeah, I mean we do have other numbers for that location, but that is like the fire and alarm, you know, uh, right."" [Agent] ""Cool. Right, right, I I understand that. um, so as long as that number is already there at one Warrenville Road, it should not be an issue."" [Customer] ""Yes Yes.""

You know, I I am sure, I am sure he would not have a problem I am sure he is not going to have a problem with it, you know, it is a great deal X year price guarantee, so we guarantee that price for X years you are not in the contract like I said, so there is no contracts here"" [Customer] ""Right. Right."" [Agent] ""You always make changes. I mean you can not say that about Verizon or anyone else because they are going to stick you in your contract and things like that, um, so that is what kind of sets us apart here, um, Carlene, can you provide me with a X digit access code to put on this account?""

Just give me one second here from Optimum."" [Customer] ""OK. Hm."" [Agent] ""Business. Alright Carlene. Alright Carlene, I just sent you that email also you know The advantage of you having my email now is that you never have to call the main optimum line again. If you have any questions, just send me an email."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK."" [Agent] ""If I can not answer it, guess what? I will put you in touch with the people that can not answer it."" [Customer] ""Great I appreciate it."" [Agent] ""So now you have yeah, now you have your own personal optimum contact um yeah um cool so we are all set for the 23rd obviously reach out to me if you want to make any changes um you should get a confirmation email shortly so we are going with the with the X gig"" [Customer] ""I, I did receive it, yes. Awesome. Mhm. OK. OK. Right."" [Agent] ""With the with the ported phone, um, that is XXX-XXX-XXXX, your monthly recurring uh at the moment is $115 obviously when you sign up for the auto pay $110 you will see a as long as you keep everything the way it is, you will see a one time installation fee of $100 on your very first bill that is for the technician to come out there and set everything up."" [Customer] ""Right. Mhm. OK."" [Agent] ""Uh, so your first bill obviously will be a little bit more than XXX, uh, because it is going to have the installation fee on there."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Uh, what I like to tell my what I like to tell my clients though is, you know once you get that first bill, you know, reach out to me"" [Customer] ""OK Mhm."" [Agent] ""I will put you in touch with billing and see if they can get you like a bill credit for the, uh, installation or something like that, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK, sounds good."" [Agent] ""Um, so, um, I can not, I can not always guarantee that, but at least we could do is ask, you know what I mean?"" [Customer] ""Right, yeah, it does not hurt."" [Agent] ""Um, and then, and then lastly. Um, this is going to be, this is very, very important, Carly, and this is for the porting of the number you are going to get another email so you should be expecting, you should be expecting two emails."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK."" [Agent] ""You should be expecting the confirmation email then you should be expecting the um authorization email so this is going to be an email where you are going to authorize the phone number to come over from Verizon to Optimum Business so um there is going to be a link in that email"" [Customer] ""Uh huh OK. OK Mhm."" [Agent] ""Open it up, click on the link."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, fill out the corresponding info which is going to be the phone number you are bringing over, the, the provider which is Verizon, they are going to ask for the Verizon account number and I, I believe Verizon also has uh a PIN number involved."" [Customer] ""Right. OK."" [Agent] ""So if you have the Verizon Pin, make sure to include that as well."" [Customer] ""I do not have a pin date. I, I always bypass it. I never had a pin and there is like I send you a one time pin, so I do not have a pen."" [Agent] ""OK, so Right, right, right, so do not worry about that."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So so include the phone number, include the provider which is Verizon, um, and then you are going to accept terms and conditions and then you are going to press submit it it is done all through that link and then as soon as you hit that submit button, that is when the X to X business days starts so make sure you do that right away so that way there is no delays."" [Customer] ""Right OK OK OK OK Yes."" [Agent] ""You can even do that um if you want to wait for the um the approval from your boss, that is totally cool, uh, if you, if you just wanted to to take care of that. Um, not obviously nothing's going to happen if you do not install so you can you can, you can take care of that authorization email"" [Customer] ""Right. And reschedule it."" [Agent] ""You can get, you can take care of the authorization email, but say your boss comes back and says, hey, you know, we are not going to go with Optimum obviously if you do end up canceling the appointment."" [Customer] ""Uh huh"" [Agent] ""All that porting stuff that you did is just going to cancel itself out too so you can kind of get that authorization out of the way, uh, because it is very, very easy, but obviously if you want to wait until you get the OK from your boss to do that, you could do that just do that as soon as possible once you get the OK, alright, so there is no delays in the installation, right?"" [Customer] ""OK OK OK OK, sounds good and thank you so much for your help, Danielle."" [Agent] ""Alright Carlene, yeah, of course, it was pleasure, pleasure speaking with you."" [Customer] ""You have a great day."" [Agent] ""Have a great day, right?"" [Customer] ""Same here, same here, thank you."" [Agent] ""Thank you for calling A and Business.""

If you go with the gig, we can give it to you for $100 a month."" [Customer] ""OK, go back at it, you said XXX for the XXX speed."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""And then what was the other one?"" [Agent] ""The $500 is $90 and the XGB is $400 but the advantage to do X gig is the offer is good for X years and if you uh get a cell phone service with us we can give you a $40 discount after three billing cycles so your internet that is going to be $100 will drop down to $60 so you will have the fastest speed internet and you will have a cell phone line also."" [Customer] ""Bless you."" [Agent] ""So if you have a phone you can bring your unlocked phone we can just ship you the SIM card.

[Customer] ""So you said, how was it like cell phone promotion thing?"" [Agent] ""OK. OK, so what I am saying is that if you go with a X gig plan which is $100 a month you sign up for a cell phone, then after XX days you will get $40 discount from your internet plan So your internet plan every month is going to be $60 for the XGB the fastest speed internet The Price is going to be good for X years."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""You are not locked in a contract, and then you will have one bill for $47 for a cell phone service and this cell phone service that we are offering you is on America's fastest FG XG network. You we also operate of the T-Mobile network, so it is basically like having T-Mobile. I have Optimum phone and when I went to Europe I had no problem, no downtime, no problem. I was getting service everywhere."" [Customer] ""OK, oK, hold on, let me, let me bring this back to you and see if I am following. You said I could get X gigabyte for $100 right?"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""$100 plus $40 for the cell phone, and this is the price is locked in for X years?"" [Agent] ""No, no, the cell phone, no, no, so $100 is the price for the internet if you sign for a cell phone, your monthly bill for the cell phone is going to be $47. Then after three billing cycles from your internet plan, you will get a $40 discount that will drop it down to X. $50 a month. So if you look at both the bills after X months, you are actually paying only $60 for the X gig internet and $47 for the cell phone service. So for $107 a month you are getting the fastest internet plus one cell phone line after three billing cycles."" [Customer] ""OK, so the 1st X billing cycles, it will cost me XXX, right?"" [Agent] ""Correct, you are right, and after the X billing cycles it is going to be XXX."" [Customer] ""XXX. mm, OK, hold on, let, let me do like a conference call so I could get my aunt on the line so she can follow and tell me if it is OK, OK, because she was asking about it.""

[Customer] ""Uh hi Desmond, uh, we have been having some issues with the um connection in our store, and the person who came to take a look, um, suggested that we look into the fiber optic option for this account. I wanted to find out a little bit more about that and. How that gets set up in the cost."" [Agent] ""Of course, no problem. I will take a look for you. Can you verify the address or account number?"" [Customer] ""Uh, the account number is XXXXXXXXXXXXX."" [Agent] ""Perfect thank you and the name of the business?"" [Customer] ""Sea Green Designs."" [Agent] ""Perfect. And last thing for security purpose, can you also verify the four digit access code on the account?"" [Customer] ""XXX X."" [Agent] ""No, something different."" [Customer] ""XXXX."" [Agent] ""No, let me see what else we could possibly use for you. What about maybe the last X of the tax ID number?"" [Customer] ""Uh, let us see. XXX X"" [Agent] ""No, it is showing something different as well."" [Customer] ""Uh, XXXXXXX."" [Agent] ""Yes."" [Customer] ""I am trying to think what the, OK."" [Agent] ""Perfect, OK."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""So you have the XXX speeds also um, how many devices are you running on your network"" [Customer] ""Uh, X."" [Agent] ""And that is including let us say maybe security cameras or anything?"" [Customer] ""We have X, well, that, that is, I was going to say that is now, it is actually probably more than that then because we have X PCs, um, we do have an iPad that we run our POS system off of, and then, uh, cell phones for our employees, you know, that when they are connected to Wi Fi. But the main, the main thing is the X PCs, X printers, um a tablet"" [Agent] ""OK. I will see if we have any upgrade options for you with speed as well because once again you have the XXX we do have XXX and X gig. So I am just going to place you on a brief hold, give me one minute."" [Customer] ""Uh, well, the only thing about that is that um we are not getting anywhere near the speed of the XXX gigabytes that we are supposed to anyway."" [Agent] ""Yeah Right over the."" [Customer] ""Like we are just not getting the speed. Like when I, when I Yeah, with the, with the, with the service that we have right, yeah, we, we, they did a test for us and when I first called and when we were having issues it was like up upload speeds of like 3.5 and then the technician came and he was able to get it to like XX."" [Agent] ""With the coop."" [Customer] ""So I do not know that upgrading is to like. The XXX is helpful. I am I am, I am not sure though, so."" [Agent] ""Well, over fiber, it will be a consistent speed, unlike the coax connection."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So it is a newer network that we do have so it will be either XXX or somewhere let us say like XXXXXX it is going to be in that range it is not going to be so off to where."" [Customer] ""But it would be on the fiber optic."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""OK, I am sorry I misunderstood what you are saying"" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""I thought you were sort of trying to look us to get to better speed on the same the network we have, but you are, you are actually saying it is XXX with fiber optic."" [Agent] ""No, the X the fiber."" [Customer] ""OK, got you."" [Agent] ""Correct."" [Customer] ""I am sorry I, I misunderstood Yeah, OK, got you."" [Agent] ""No worries, so I will be right back."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""OK, thank you for being patient."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So to upgrade to the fiber XXX meg internet speed would be a difference of $100. It would make your total monthly bill $354.94 XX cents. It would be a free install, of course we will come out swap out the modem equipment, put the new fiber line in, and get everything set up for you."" [Customer] ""OK, uh, and then when I am ready to move forward with, with that, do I just call again call sales again to get that set up, or how do I, I am not ready to move forward with it now when I want to, when do I, how do I move forward"" [Agent] ""Yes, same thing you would give us a call. Any concerns that you have right now?"" [Customer] ""Um, I am just like budget wise I just need to make sure that it makes sense for us."" [Agent] ""Got you. So more of the budget than anything. Let me see what the $300 fee would be for you if you stick with the XXX. It might be more of the ballpark that you are looking for, and you can always upgrade to the XXX or X gig if you need it like in the future you needed something faster than the XXX."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So let us see what that would be. So the XXX speed would be $55 making the total monthly bill XXXXX."" [Customer] ""OK. Um, Yeah, I think then And then what in terms of like my billing and all that sort of stuff is just how."" [Agent] ""Everything will remain the same."" [Customer] ""Is it going to be prorated?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, like your billing cycle is going to remain the same."" [Customer] ""OK, so it is just going to, they are just going to."" [Agent] ""Let me see, it is based off of when it is set up is when the prorated charge would kick in. So let us see, for example, if we pick. Waiting for the days to pop up, give me one second. OK, here we go so next available date in this area is Thursday the 22nd, so let us say if we go with next Thursday. Waiting for the prorated now. The prorated would be $28.41 for that billing cycle, but it would be on the next billing cycle. So for example, nothing would be paid today over the phone, nothing is given to the technician everything would be on the first bill after the upgrade"" [Customer] ""OK, um, and you said the XX. I is the day the technician would be in the area, uh, yeah, OK, yeah, I, I would like to go ahead and set that up, yeah, yeah."" [Agent] ""That'll work? OK perfect so we have a time frame from X to XX that day. Would that time work for you?"" [Customer] ""As long as they can call me in advance I can be here at X a.m. We do not open here until uh XX, um, but if I need to be here at X a.m. then then yes, and I would prefer to have it be earlier so."" [Agent] ""OK, they will give you a call about XX-XX minutes out, uh, just to let you know, OK, we also have X to X on Thursday as well, Friday the 23rd we have X to XX or XX to X we also have Saturday"" [Customer] ""That is fine, yeah. No, that that time frame on the 22nd is is better because I would rather have less service disruption when they are trying to switch everything over so."" [Agent] ""Yeah. OK perfect so let us see what would be a good number for the technician to call that day?"" [Customer] ""Um, XXX. XXX. XXXX."" [Agent] ""XX Perfect, so they will give you a call about XXXX minutes out."" [Customer] ""Great."" [Agent] ""And just to give you a quick recap, monthly rate would be the XXX. And XX cents a difference of $55 for install for the technician to come out to the location and just to let you know as well, we recently came with came out with our uh backup Internet server also here at Optimum is through the cellular network. So if you do have any allergies in the area due to inclement weather, a line is damaged, no matter what the scenario is, it will automatically kick in and roll over to the cellular backup until the line is up and running. So we do have that as other options now. I believe that is starting at about $30 a month."" [Customer] ""No, I think I think we are good with with just this upgrade for now then we will, we, we can go from there"" [Agent] ""Perfect and if anything changes for you with the date and time just give us a call we will get it rescheduled."" [Customer] ""OK, thank you so much for your help."" [Agent] ""You are very welcome we will see you then."" [Customer] ""Thanks. OK, bye."" [Agent] ""Bye"""

That time it was a residential."" [Agent] ""OK, so that is probably why you did it because, uh Optimum stores are for personal residential services only You really can not do anything business wise there with the exception of bringing back equipment, for example, like if you disconnected a business account, you can return the equipment to an optimum store you really can not do anything else"" [Customer] ""OK. Mhm. Got you. Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um,"" [Customer] ""Right, so let us get the price on the on the TV first and then we can discuss that a little further."" [Agent] ""Got you. OK, so.

So basic is $53 and you have two boxes that is $28 and then you have the additional box. I sell that tomorrow XX. Yeah, so your bill is $90.95 before tax, um, OK. Alright, so if I take off the basic."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, and I add the value, the difference is $92 making your new bill XXXXX. And that value package gives you HG and Fox News."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Uh,"" [Customer] ""That is great."" [Agent] ""Uh, one other thing, one other thing I would like to mention is, um, the one thing I do not see on your account here is our premier support and protection."" [Customer] ""Uh, Right."" [Agent] ""So what that is super, it is it could be a super valuable resource for you. So besides having 24/7 tech support with free tech visits and things like that 24/7 around the clock, we also protect, we also protect your devices. At the address, so with your service here. Being your TVs. So, if your TVs were to break. Guess what? We are not even going to bother to try and fix it. We are just going to replace them. By giving you a credit for um it is a like for like sort of situation. Um, if you have an older TV and we can not get that, that same model, we actually give you the newer model.

We protect you up to $10,000 in a XX month period. We either replace or help you fix any of your said devices. The only thing that it does not cover is personal devices, so cell phones and things like that. But for you it is a big thing we just we just replaced TVs um."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Which is, you know, it could be, it could be awesome for you if you know to go out and buy another $500 to $600 TV, whatever the case may be if it breaks on you, so we got you covered on that. So if you want to."" [Customer] ""And did you, did you say laptops as well?""

If we can not, can not fix it, we will replace it like for like."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Some devices do carry a deductible with the exception of TVs we just replace your TV But for example, your laptop, um, there is like I think it is like an $85 deductible. And then, you know, we help you replace your laptop or something like that."" [Customer] ""Yes it is."" [Agent] ""So it is nothing crazy."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Um, so if you wanted to add that feature, That feature is XX bucks monthly. If you want to put that on there, making the total increase, you will go from a $92 increase for just the TV adding the support, you are looking at an increase of $132 because it is an extra $40 making your total bill XXXXX cents that way you have your upgrade on your TV now all your business devices are protected as well"" [Customer] ""OK, that is very interesting. I can not make that decision, uh so I can call you back after I meet with people on Monday, um"" [Agent] ""Got you, but you can do the TV?"" [Customer] ""In the meantime, we, we do want to do the uh the TV upgrade. I do have some. Questions because my January bill."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""For the optimum TV."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Uh, was a basic TV which we are going to get rid of that was $50."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""And then there was an additional outlet charge for XXX. I have no idea what that is."" [Agent] ""Right. That is because you have X boxes."" [Customer] ""So that is 59.95."" [Agent] ""So it is because you have two boxes so your first box is free So any additional box is, uh, XX, uh, besides paying for the box, the outlet is is an additional $10 a month. So because, so because you have X boxes, it is an additional XX on top of the box fee."" [Customer] ""OK. OK, I get billed XXX instead of XX, but that is fine, um."" [Agent] ""Right."" [Customer] ""And then I had a charged for two cable boxes at $26.13 dollars each."" [Agent] ""Uh, so the, the boxes went up, the boxes went up from XX to XX, so that is why your bill may be a little higher."" [Customer] ""Uh Uh, Yeah, yeah, yeah, I had uh like I had a total of XXX with the basic anyway, this is fine um you said the total is going to be XXX XX"" [Agent] ""That is why, that, that, that is why we are getting a difference of price. You are getting XX something I am getting XX OK. XXXXX before tax I can give you the the estimated tax at the it tells me at the last screen here. So give me a second. So this should happen right away, um. You may have to, you know, unplug your box and replug it in you should get the The new channels pretty much right away. Um,"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So you are going to go from XX channels to just about, you know, just a little over XXX channels, it is a huge jump here."" [Customer] ""That is great."" [Agent] ""Uh, let me just finalize everything. And then I have an email of Dennis at on drives.us."" [Customer] ""Yes, you got it right."" [Agent] ""Cool."" [Customer] ""Most people do not get it right."" [Agent] ""Did they say one? Do you think it is one drive?"" [Customer] ""They go one drives and yeah."" [Agent] ""I mean, clearly says on, but you know, tomato tomato."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""And then I have a phone number of XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Customer] ""Yes, and that is what we are on right now."" [Agent] ""OK, cool, um, so this is a TV only account. Who do you have for your internet service?"" [Customer] ""We have a static IP address."" [Agent] ""Oh."" [Customer] ""Do what."" [Agent] ""OK. Do you have, do you have Wi Fi through like Verizon or anyone else? Uh, or ethernet, like, uh, you know, like with the modem and all that good stuff."" [Customer] ""I am not. I am very old."" [Agent] ""Got you."" [Customer] ""When I went to school, we did not have calculators we did not have any machines"" [Agent] ""Right, yes, slide rules."" [Customer] ""We had slide, we had slide rules yes, so, uh, I do not know the answer to that question"" [Agent] ""My dad tells me those stories all the time. Got you. Alright, um, because I do not see any internet anywhere. I just see TV so if you, if you need internet for the office, obviously we can provide that, um."" [Customer] ""No. Yeah, no, it is, it is here. I mean, I, it works on my computers. I have got X or X computers here."" [Agent] ""Alright, you might Right you might have another account you probably have another account somewhere um, at the same address, but"" [Customer] ""Well, I have the, the, uh, the static ID IP account is a separate account number with Optimum."" [Agent] ""Right, yeah, so the, the internet is probably on that account, um the reason I was asking about your internet is because, um You can get an additional discount on your internet bill when you bundle in your cell phone. So if you switch companies from your current cell phone company to Optimum mobile, um, you can get a, uh, you can get up to a $40 discount on your internet bill depending on what."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Plan you have so I can check that out for you if you want."" [Customer] ""OK, that is interesting. I, I found my internet bill. It is uh. Altogether total internet is $225 a month."" [Agent] ""Right, OK, cool, so give me one second here and let me just pull up that."" [Customer] ""Um,"" [Agent] ""Uh, so I pushed through through that order so your your cable boxes should update momentarily."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Go to Fox News."" [Customer] ""You were just going to give me the the tax number if you can not change as much but."" [Agent] ""Um, Right, X $10.63 it says right here, so."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""XXXX plus XXXX that is approximate. Um, So that went through so give it a few minutes and then try going to Fox News and then it should be there."" [Customer] ""OK, and you said if not I I could unplug the box and wait a few minutes back in."" [Agent] ""Yeah, if you unplug the box, you wait a few minutes and and then plug it back in and it should be there."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, OK, cool."" [Customer] ""And I will do the same thing on on on both boxes."" [Agent] ""On the other box as well, yeah, yeah, what is the other account number, uh, Dennis?"" [Customer] ""Uh, the Uh, static IP number is here it is XXXXXXXXXXXXXX."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Got you here we go. Yeah, so it is looks like it is the same address."" [Customer] ""Mhm.X something."" [Agent] ""Yeah, OK, oh, that is why, OK, I see, I see where I see why you have a separate TV account because you have fiber. Internet, so the TV has to be on its own separate account."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Alright, so you have a static IP here you have XXX megs OK, so if and your bill is about $85. So if you were to bring over your cell phone from your current company to Optimum Mobile."" [Customer] ""Right, Verizon, mhm."" [Agent] ""And I attach it and I attach it to the account here so it would technically be a business mobile account but obviously it is your personal cell phone, um."" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""If I when I attach it to the account here for for on drives that $85 goes down to $70. You get a $15 discount on your internet bill. And then when you bring over your current phone that you have right now, your cell phone, uh, the cost for the cell phone bill is only $45 a month, unlimited data, unlimited talk and text, and we partnered up with T-Mobile, so we are on the T-Mobile network, so it is kind of like you would be switching from Verizon to T-Mobile. Obviously your bill is going to say optimum as opposed to T-Mobile, uh, but essentially it is T-Mobile service, um, so if you are interested in saving $15 a month on your internet bill, you can bundle in your mobile."" [Customer] ""Right. Mhm. OK, and we do not switch phones so you just switch the service."" [Agent] ""No, you, you keep your same phone. We just switch your, your internet service."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""Are you currently paying off your phone at Verizon or is that all? Over and done with."" [Customer] ""Mm, again. I am not in charge of that department."" [Agent] ""Oh, I see."" [Customer] ""I do not know."" [Agent] ""I see, so it is OK, um, I got you."" [Customer] ""I am only, I am only the CEO. They do not let me know everything."" [Agent] ""Right. Um, so if you have multiple lines, uh, on the business account, obviously you can bring all those over. You do get multi line discounts, but if you just wanted to bring yours over, you could do that so you can get the discount, um, on the internet bill here. So what I would recommend is, um, take a look at your Verizon cell phone bill and see if you are, see if you are, see if you are paying off the phone in installments."" [Customer] ""Mhm, mhm."" [Agent] ""I know, you know, a lot of, a lot of us do the, um, ins installments for the iPhones because they are a million dollars."" [Customer] ""OK. Quick thinking about it, I would probably have about XX to XX phones."" [Agent] ""Got you so you can have up you could you can have up to XX mobile lines on a business account."" [Customer] ""Uh, out there"" [Agent] ""Um, I can set up the 1st X for you then you would do the additional XX on your own"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Unfortunately that is just the way it is right now, um."" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""So you can do that um if you were to bring over all X phones, um, at least the ones I would do for you, um, that is $45 per line actually goes down to $25 per line. Uh, because the, the, the price breaks is at X lines. So, um, one line is XX X to X lines is XX Um, anything over $5 and above is $25 so, um, it is a pretty decent deal there $25 a line then you get your $50 off"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""So what I am going to do right now is um, I am going to send you an email"" [Customer] ""Great."" [Agent] ""I have a direct phone number here, um, so if you need to get so in order to get in contact with me directly just, you know, reply to my email. Take a look at your Verizon bill.""

Let me just see here. This is Monera Auto repair."" [Customer] ""Mhm I just had a technician here. And we did some tests and stuff like that. He fixed some stuff, but based on my equipment he recommended for me to get the XXX I have always had the XXX."" [Agent] ""OK, oh, let us take a look. So we could do. He said this is fiber capable as well. I am surprised he did not recommend fiber. Um, let me take a look. And may I have your X digit access code then?"" [Customer] ""XXXX."" [Agent] ""Awesome. And who do I have the pleasure of speaking with?"" [Customer] ""Yeah hiya Nunez."" [Agent] ""Thank you. Sorry I am just waiting to get into your account here."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Mm mm"" [Agent] ""Yeah, you can actually update to fiber. Oh, you have X modems too."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I have XX actually because I have a another modem that is modem WiX which was something we were discussing because he was like you can get a modem for your X lines instead of having this mess because I have a mess of cables. That are like very sensitive if I move the TV or something everything goes off."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""So he was like, look, if in the future you want to, you should clean that up."" [Agent] ""OK, let me just see something that we could do here. Yeah, because you have like an additional mode um. Uh. So odd, um."" [Customer] ""If you could fix my world, I would appreciate it."" [Agent] ""I am I am going to try my best, man, to help you out and fix your world."" [Customer] ""Catherine. Yeah to get a manual text do not clean anything. X. Hello from NM Transmission. I Yeah.

I am just working on this for you."" [Customer] ""Oh hello please."" [Agent] ""I just want to see something."" [Customer] ""Do do do do. Oh shit, I have to X."" [Agent] ""Sorry ma'am, let us see here let us see."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Oh shit. Oh no what is going on here. OK, that is the taxpayer. Thursday OK, home data. Mhm. Wow, it is 9:30. It feels like it is freaking XX. Uh, no, it is fine, it is fine."" [Agent] ""Bear with me."" [Customer] ""I am just talking to myself. Hm. OK, got it. Mm mm mm hm."" [Agent] ""Let me just see something here."" [Customer] ""Do you mind if I put you on speaker? that way I do not have to have the phone in my ear."" [Agent] ""Sure, you can you can put me on speaker Go ahead, ma'am, do your thing."" [Customer] ""Alright DG Where like close. OK From here, from here. I am here. Oh OK, that is Yeah This."" [Agent] ""We are almost out here, ma'am."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Sorry about that. It is taking so long."" [Customer] ""Oh OK. Oh."" [Agent] ""Mm OK, so what I am going to suggest um, I know the technician told you could do XXX, ma'am, you can actually upgrade to fiber Fiber is available here at this location. So what I would recommend is that you upgrade to fiber."" [Customer] ""So what is the difference between fiber and what I have?"" [Agent] ""So what what you have is a shared speed with the coax you have XXX megabits down and about XX upload right now with the fiber you are getting guaranteed speed, so you will be getting symmetrical speed, the same speeds up and down. So you could go to say X gigabyte down. And X gigabyte up, meaning you would have guaranteed speed. You can upgrade your primary modem to fiber and probably when you do that, you may be able to, I am not sure why you have two modems for internet, like a dedicated like you have two modems. I am not sure why you have two modems, but."" [Customer] ""I have X modems."" [Agent] ""Yeah, one is for voice like a voice modem."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""You can have a combined modem so when the technician comes out for the fiber upgrade, they could probably combine the fiber modem with the X phone lines that you have, if that makes sense."" [Customer] ""That would be great, but."" [Agent] ""I consolidate your equipment a bit. But the thing with fiber is that you would be getting guaranteed speed whereas right now your speed can fluctuate depending on how many devices you have or the time of day or something like that."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I am surprised the technician did not mention fiber because this address is fiber capable."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So you can get guaranteed speeds, symmetrical speeds. The difference in price would be $105 you would have way better performance here, ma'am And then you could probably do away with your second modem that you are paying $155 for."" [Customer] ""Oh So if I upgrade to fiber my bill will go up XXX, but it will also come down because I will have one modem is what you are saying?"" [Agent] ""So once the technician installs the fiber modem, they do the testing and they make sure you are getting those speeds. You could probably, you know, unless you need that second modem for something I would just suggest upgrading to fiber, a better connection If you, if you remove the second modem, yes, ma'am. Mhm."" [Customer] ""What about they do not want to remove it because I feel like they just do not want to deal with the mess of the lines."" [Agent] ""cause you have."" [Customer] ""Because I have uh yeah because I have uh what do you call this?"" [Agent] ""Who the technician? I mean, you are the customer, ma'am, so you, you, you can, we can consolidate so I can put in the work order comments what customer would like one combined modem for internet and voice cause we have to swap a modem anyway, so it makes sense to give you a better modem. Does that make sense?"" [Customer] ""Sure."" [Agent] ""We would have to send the tech out. There is no fee for the technicians to come out or anything like that."" [Customer] ""OK, but No, no, no, I get that, but the thing is that I have a voice system here."" [Agent] ""So the tech fee would be, mhm. Mhm."" [Customer] ""Um, Like it is a landline it is one of those Verizon things from back in the days and when I have tried to get all of it consolidated, they are like oh no because you have those lines."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""So it is like I do not know it is going to go down."" [Agent] ""No, we would, so no, so with the fiber installation that should not be the case with the fiber installation we send two technicians. So the first technician, it is a survey. They make sure the fiber connections are on the pole, so they make sure all the outside work done."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""We can actually take a look at your what you have as well and address that beforehand."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So we, we can look at that if you would like, and that does not cost anything."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""The upgrade would not cost anything for the tech to come out, so you would not be paying for the fee for the tech."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So it is done in two appointments."" [Customer] ""And then you would note in the account that I want to withdraw one of the modems consolidate OK."" [Agent] ""Consolidate, yes, well, we were, yes, we are doing that and they should see that you have X modems already, so they should be knowing this, but I will put that customer would like to consolidate voice and data modem. Let me actually put that now."" [Customer] ""She"" [Agent] ""wants to consolidate."" [Customer] ""But the thing is that they would all have the little Jack thing to put the phone line in. Would they?"" [Agent] ""Uh, that the technician would have to look at when they come out to."" [Customer] ""You know that it says telephone. Well, I will talk to the technician, yeah, when they come."" [Agent] ""It is all that mode on."" [Customer] ""The telephone no."" [Agent] ""And I always advise ma'am not to sign off on any work order or anything like that until everything is to your liking with the installation process, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK. Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, let us see how quickly I can get you these appointments."" [Customer] ""Um, let us see how quickly I can."" [Agent] ""Uh, are certain days slower for you? Like, tell me what days of the week work better for you, ma'am."" [Customer] ""Right, because we are not, we are going to be with our, we are not going to have a phone while they are doing this, right, um, Wednesday morning."" [Agent] ""Uh, the internet service Wednesdays, OK, Wednesday."" [Customer] ""Wednesday mornings just let me look at my schedule."" [Agent] ""So Wednesday the 21st?"" [Customer] ""Hold on, let me just get my because I know Javell has an appointment."" [Agent] ""No worries, take your time."" [Customer] ""It is like I have to split myself between the kids and the job. Um, May 21st class. Let me just make sure my father does not have, oh no, he has stuff during the day. What time would they come?"" [Agent] ""I could do X to XXXX to X, or X to XX is good, and I can have them call you Ms."" [Customer] ""I could do X That would be great X to XX. OK, this guy is going to survey."" [Agent] ""Nunez, right? No, this would be the the upgrade."" [Customer] ""be the The survey would be done before the survey is less invasive so you guys do not have to stop"" [Agent] ""The survey would be done before. The survey is less invasive so you guys do not have to stop working for the survey The survey I could have done right away."" [Customer] ""Oh, so the survey, OK, great."" [Agent] ""Yeah, I could do that maybe tomorrow. I just want to know what day of the week would be better for an actual upgrade for you."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Do is the Wednesday the 21st going to work for that or?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, the 21st, mhm, yeah, yeah, from X to XX, and then I will do the call forwarding before they start."" [Agent] ""OK, OK, and then. OK, and then let me see what I can do to survey for you, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK, and then let me see what I can do to survey for you, OK."" [Agent] ""I know it is kind of weird."" [Customer] ""I know it is kind of weird to schedule that and the upgrades."" [Agent] ""It schedules that in the upgrade first. It is probably after. It should be the opposite way, but bear with me."" [Customer] ""Mhm Hm"" [Agent] ""I am going to check it out for you. I am going to schedule that for you now."" [Customer] ""I am going to schedule that for you."" [Agent] ""Hold on. I go. And then I am just going to review everything with you, ma'am."" [Customer] ""OK"" [Agent] ""Thank you so much for your patience on this call with me."" [Customer] ""Yeah, no, no problem."" [Agent] ""So the survey we can do, let us see, how about, why is it giving me after now?"" [Customer] ""Oh, that is me now."" [Agent] ""That is so crazy. Hold on. Um, So the 22nd is the first day for the survey, so weird, um."" [Customer] ""On the 22nd of the. OK, so I guess we can change it if anything."" [Agent] ""Yeah, I am going to change it. Now we have to go back. I am so sorry."" [Customer] ""It is OK."" [Agent] ""We could do this for a surgery on the 22nd, and then, yes."" [Customer] ""For the survey, right? In the morning."" [Agent] ""OK, so I will try to put that in for X to XX and then the actual do you want to go to the following Wednesday then"" [Customer] ""OK, so I will try to put that in for X to XX mhm."" [Agent] ""Is the best day? OK."" [Customer] ""Yeah, because I am have a surgery on the twenty-ninth, yeah, perfect."" [Agent] ""Oh good luck on your uh surgery, ma'am."" [Customer] ""Thank you, thank you, it is a test, but you know they put you to sleep and all that crap, so it is like it is like surgery. You go into a room. OK, upgrade for now can we just use the XXX because my new Internet, I mean cameras are not working properly."" [Agent] ""I wish you would. Oh, so then we would probably have to cancel what we just did to create that."" [Customer] ""I do not. Hi."" [Agent] ""They are not working at all."" [Customer] ""Do I have mama?"" [Agent] ""We would have to cancel the change to push in the XXX."" [Customer] ""Have to cancel the XXX so if you want to do that and we have them and then we have to reschedule."" [Agent] ""So do you want to do that? Let me have them cancel this then we would have to reschedule You want to push through the XXX?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, we need to push to the XXX for now to see if that is going to work."" [Agent] ""OK Oh, so yeah, so this is, this is probably why you need fiber as well."" [Customer] ""I had to add more cameras because the insurance requires it, but I added wireless cameras, so I have like extenders that are connected to the modem and they are still not working."" [Agent] ""That is crazy, um, so that is a great thing that you said."" [Customer] ""Um."" [Agent] ""Hold on, let me have my support team cancel it so I could put through the XXX speed for you in the meantime."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Alright, hold on one second, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK. Thank you for calling sales enablement. This is Marsha. How may I help you?"" [Agent] ""Hi Ms. Marsha, this is Dana. XXX is my rep number. I was calling to see if you can cancel my pending change so I could upgrade her temporarily to the XXX then I will put back my pending change"" [Customer] ""OK Daniel, what is the account number?"" [Agent] ""Uh, it is corp XXXXX-XXX-XX. You know it took me a long time to put through the spending change too because of the whole fiber in the multiple lines."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I get that. But she wants to upgrade to XXX in the meantime and then. Then put back the appointment for the fiber."" [Customer] ""OK, can you give me that account number again? I am coming up with nothing."" [Agent] ""XXXXX-XXXXXX-XX"" [Customer] ""Mhm, mhm."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""I had those numbers transposed. OK, so I am canceling the change of service."" [Agent] ""Yeah, mhm, and then I will just do a no truck and and put back on my change of service."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Hope you do not need no troubleshooting or anything unless you go through."" [Customer] ""If not, uh, with the upgrade, just get her over to tech support and they should be able to provision her modem."" [Agent] ""Yeah, cause she said the tech um told her. I think he was out there today, so he said, hey, up, and one modem says no, so I am thinking it is the modem with the XXX that needs to be upgraded cause the other one says like offline boost or something, the additional modem."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK."" [Agent] ""So I do not know if that is why like it is not working like that like you know what I mean like I do not know."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""Just weird. I am all the way out of it. Now ID is spinning. Says order but I am not even in it you know what?"" [Customer] ""OK, now try it."" [Agent] ""Oh hold on, it says OK account you know it is so weird is saying account already locked, but I am not in it. Alright, hold on."" [Customer] ""I was in it."" [Agent] ""Oh no, OK, hold on. Alright let me go into it. It is the morning I definitely escalated that call with that came through the queue like X times with the um the Wi Fi thing."" [Customer] ""Yes it is. Yeah, I, who would make those corrections?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, so I do not know. They have been looking at that wrong IVR and it is different reps. So uh the first guy I spoke to was a gentleman. Tasha spoke with a woman, then I spoke with a woman like so it is diff, so I do not know how the call is going to different people. Like I do not know what is happening, but."" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""I did tell her to reach out to her lead. The previous guy asked me to transfer him to sales support to see if they could help fix the code, but then you said you could not add it, so I do not know like, and I was like I can not add it. There is no sale so I can not fix the code Maybe this is something you need to escalate I do not know"" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""After the 3rd time I just took a little break, so."" [Customer] ""His supervisor, he should have had his supervisor."" [Agent] ""I did escalate it we have like an incorrect transfer chat"" [Customer] ""No, he should have."" [Agent] ""I, oh yeah, I told her that too she, she started getting like angry"" [Customer] ""Because it Oh, but yeah, because it is not adding revenue and they always told that if it is not adding revenue, just send it on."" [Agent] ""I do not know. Yeah, no, it is not. That is what I was trying to explain to them, and from our and all I did was read the history of what happened."" [Customer] ""So it is their issue to get a modem out there."" [Agent] ""That is all I did was read the history. That is why I said to her. I was like all I did is I am reading the history It said the customer had like they were just replacing a switch. It is not like a sales call."" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""It is all I did, read the history, but you know, it was just like one of those things where"" [Customer] ""We just got caught in it."" [Agent] ""Yes ma'am. Yes ma'am, I think it is allowing me to go through there is an existing router not compatible with Optimum tier selected."" [Customer] ""OK, so you do not have to, so they have to bring a modem."" [Agent] ""But the tech was just out there, so she needs a modem swap anyway, right?"" [Customer] ""And I may have to close it for you. Um, what speed is she?"" [Agent] ""XXX and he said to go to X."" [Customer] ""And the modem."" [Agent] ""It would be the XXX X that I would be replacing, no?"" [Customer] ""Uh-huh, it needs to be at least a XX channel modem."" [Agent] ""Um, let me go into the equipment and check, hold on."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Going to equipment at least hopefully I remember how to do this. OK, I am still waiting for the equipment to to open up. here is the modem. Um, clicking on the modem here, so this one says Upstream X and X, so this modem that I first clicked on is not compatible."" [Customer] ""Yeah, it is not compatible."" [Agent] ""So let me go into the next modem. Mhm, you might have a problem she just had a. Oh, did I, is this the same because why are they saying X and X? Hold on, let me unless I did not do the right one. Let me just make sure. I thought I believe I did both modems, but."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""Yeah I do not know what is going on here she just had a check out It is so weird. I do not know what is going on. OK, Ms. Marsha, you can double check I feel like both modems say the same thing I am confused as to why"" [Customer] ""OK, let me take a look and see what is going on."" [Agent] ""Yeah, hold on, so she is going to need a truck roll regardless."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Sounds like it."" [Agent] ""She just had a text today. Hold on, let me get all the way out of the account."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Alright, and I am just going to break my hold with her, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK. Hello."" [Agent] ""So we canceled the pending change for the fiber um we are just working on the upgrading to the XXX temporarily I know you had a technician out today"" [Customer] ""OK. I Uh No, no."" [Agent] ""Did he swap your modem? OK, because it sounds like the modem that you have are not even compatible for the XXX that you would need."" [Customer] ""OK It is a moment, a moment. Can you hold on a second, hold on, hold on."" [Agent] ""Sure, yeah."" [Customer] ""Do not hang up on me. See so so come inside prime. OK. Guanoa primero. Uh huh OK. OK. Because the demo that, OK. OK, so el mato mata deli. Oh Uh-huh. OK, Paoon. OK, Musa gracia. OK, Juan quieres say, OK, so. Oh, OK, Taviledigo."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so they did not replace your modem, but it looks like, OK, I am so sorry."" [Customer] ""OK, so, OK, I am sorry I am just like talking another language"" [Agent] ""I did not realize. No, no, you are fine."" [Customer] ""Go ahead, mama."" [Agent] ""No, no, you are fine. So the tech did not replace your modem, but it seems like your modems that you have are not compatible for the XXX speed. So regardless of what, ma'am, you are going to need a modem swap."" [Customer] ""Yeah. Give me."" [Agent] ""That is crazy. Um, let me just see and maybe we, I will see how quickly we could do the XXX and then maybe we could do the fiber after if you want to do it like that, like if you just want to go to XXX and then the fiber after, but I am having her check both modems both modems seem like they are not compatible for the speed, so bear with me, OK?"" [Customer] ""Um and And then maybe we can. Yeah thanks mhm. Bear with me OK? OK."" [Agent] ""I have my escalations team on the line assisting so bear with me."" [Customer] ""I have my escalation Alright"" [Agent] ""Yes, Miss Marsha, both her modems are not compatible, right?"" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK, now she has another modem on there, Dana that first modem with AXC"" [Agent] ""Mhm. Mhm."" [Customer] ""If now that one is compatible. There is a XX."" [Agent] ""Oh, OK, so the AXC that can do it? OK."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""Alright, so let me go here. So, so should I just remove that router that um router thing"" [Customer] ""What r thing."" [Agent] ""It is saying the router is not compatible. Should I take off that router um, the optimum router"" [Customer] ""Uh, It will not push through?"" [Agent] ""Let me see. It was telling Mm, it did not."" [Customer] ""Sometimes it will let you go ahead to the next one. And then if you have to put it in a no schedule you can."" [Agent] ""OK, uh, let me see."" [Customer] ""Or if you have to schedule it out, I can close it."" [Agent] ""OK, let me see, I will try it that way. Let me remove the XXX. Let us see what I got. Oh, maybe because it had the AX x X, you know, it has the, maybe that is what it is. You know how it has the X?"" [Customer] ""Uh-huh. Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""It is only supposed to be one."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So let me change the quantity."" [Customer] ""Let us see what happens."" [Agent] ""OK, I will change the quantity to one. OK, now it says X additional OL service needs rate code 0.9."" [Customer] ""Oh, how many Internet services does she have?"" [Agent] ""Two modems. That I think Mhm."" [Customer] ""So she has X internet connections there? OK, and both of them are what?"" [Agent] ""I do not really see a speed on the additional modem."" [Customer] ""Because one of them would have to be a XXX and the other one can be upgraded."" [Agent] ""I do not, I do not see a speed on that."" [Customer] ""So maybe that is the issue."" [Agent] ""I do not see a speed on the um the additional modem that is my show."" [Customer] ""OK, so that is what that is what it is, it is going to have to be scheduled to the field."" [Agent] ""Oh, OK."" [Customer] ""Because I think when you upgrade both of them are the same."" [Agent] ""Uh-huh."" [Customer] ""And so she would have X, um XXX or X XXX, but uh one of them would be connected, but the other one would not be connected."" [Agent] ""I am so confused."" [Customer] ""So there is no. OK, if she, if she has two internet connections."" [Agent] ""Sorry, tell me, tell me what to do. Mhm."" [Customer] ""Then she needs X modems on there that is um higher than XX. Down, um, and she has only X and it is the XX. So it needs to be scheduled to the field."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Unless you have a way of putting one at X and the other one at uh."" [Agent] ""So"" [Customer] ""XXX."" [Agent] ""OK, uh, let me just see here and then hold on."" [Customer] ""Uh huh."" [Agent] ""Mm. OK, uh, let us see, I did a default XXX speed."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Let us see. Um, oh, hold on, this is the thing though. It is like it is oh here, let me see if I can let her do the no charge one. So like it is charging her, but I, you know right now she is paying the additional modem the modem rental"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Let us see here. It was such a mess. I this account is such. Even the customer knows this account. I was like I know she said that like the modems and everything."" [Customer] ""A me mhm. Mhm."" [Agent] ""Sorry, I am waiting for IDA. Oh, let us see what what I am getting now."" [Customer] ""No problem."" [Agent] ""XT additional modem needs secure net. OK, hold on. You to bring wireless router requires bring modem. OK, so it is telling me to bring a modem."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""OK, and then it is telling me secure net the 0.9. Even when I was trying to do the upgrade before to the fiber, it was like a whole thing because it just took a long time."" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""And then for her to be like oh, I just want the XXX like the tech told me OK, and her service is not working, so he did not even do anything."" [Customer] ""Did not do nothing. You could at least try one of the modems."" [Agent] ""Secure that should match. Instance, OK, so let us move the plus X, yes. OK Hitting next, security code should match. I, oh, how many secure nets does she have? There was like, OK, she has X here plus X, but it is built in. Hold on, it is so crazy."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""It is like it is duplicated. OK, let us see, I removed. Move it on top and I removed there is a plus X this that I did that. Oh, that is a different rate code. The plus X is a XX months. OK, the XX. This is a lot. I am sorry, Miss Marsha, that is taking so long."" [Customer] ""No, that is OK."" [Agent] ""I am waiting on IDA to hit next to see if I am able to even do this upgrade."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""Oh here we go. It is spinning. OK, product rules require. So, um, bring Tia missing OL install code. OK, so let us see, uh, OK, because the promo, hold on."" [Customer] ""Will you just take the HK?"" [Agent] ""Yep, that is what I am about to do the HK hold on."" [Customer] ""OK, at no charge so we can."" [Agent] ""Move forward, yup. And it is going to"" [Customer] ""No, so we can get it on there for."" [Agent] ""Uh-huh. And hold on. And hold on internet and now the rate went up because it is saying that XX is a hold on, so we do the HK. But this is so much. Yeah, we do not even charge this network access fee anymore, so that can go away."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, hold on, I am going to upgrade coax offers because it just made her rate go sky high because it is told me I need to remove all that other stuff, so it is you minus XX T. Plus now I am going to have to give her a promo because it is like her rate been high high sky high but because it is telling me I have to remove all the other stuff um to use that rate."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh. OK."" [Agent] ""So hold on, you this, that is the promo tracking code. Let us see, the XX, does she have that? I think so. I am sorry, Miss Marsha. Doing what ID says to do XX she has that we are going to replace that XXX with the plus hashtag that is the XXX, yeah, and then we are going to add dollar sign, dollar sign. The discount code, maybe I will take off something. I took off $70 then we are going to add the backslash fee, OK And"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I am OK. So the increase on her bill is XXX, that is even more than when it was with the fiber, so crazy, but whatever. That is what it is saying it is going to be. And hit next. Culture may not be selected more than, oh hold on."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Oh, I still have the uh XX month. OK, so now it is actually less because I so did you selected that um. OK, I think we have it hold on."" [Customer] ""Uh huh."" [Agent] ""I am so sorry, Miss Marsha. Hitting next and it is almost. This is going to take so long. Yeah, XX minutes for oh, Miss Marsha, perfect. Now it is giving me a warning for that UT."" [Customer] ""Oh right OK, great."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""We can, we can work with a warning."" [Agent] ""Alright, and then the XX, so the modem that is compatible is the AXCFDXXXXX FEFX, correct?"" [Customer] ""Yes, that is for the XXX."" [Agent] ""OK, oK, so I hit that, hit next then oh for this one I am going to select the XXX, so you are right for that second motor Am I no trucking this or?"" [Customer] ""Yes, uh, see if you can no truck it. If not, then I will do it for you."" [Agent] ""OK, I put it in no schedule because it does not allow me to."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""All right, and then I am just going to hold on. Break my hold with her. Well, hold on, I am still scheduling. Lord, this was so crazy, Ms."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Marcia. OK, so now in. OK dokey. Alright, so I did that and then allow me a moment. I am going to break my hold with her, OK? Alright ma'am, so the change for the $500 would be $71.15 and my support team is going to push it through, so you do have a compatible modem that can handle that speed so you do not need a tech to come out."" [Customer] ""$500 would be $71.15 and my support team is going to push it through. I can handle that for you. OK great."" [Agent] ""OK, and then because you verified the access code on the account, I will, well, tech support will be able to see which modem as well, but just in case you want to know what modem is associated with that speed, but I am just waiting for them to push through the speed on there for you, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK, and then because you verified the access. Uh, I will, well. You Alright, I wonder if it is the new one."" [Agent] ""It is probably the new mode, it is probably the newer modem because you have two modems."" [Customer] ""It is probably I have X modems."" [Agent] ""So you have a standard modem. Well, yeah, X, but one is for voice."" [Customer] ""Well yeah."" [Agent] ""I am talking about the X internet. Sorry, I keep confusing you when I say that."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""You have two data modems that are for internet only, Miss Nunez."" [Customer] ""OK. Mhm."" [Agent] ""So those are the modems that we are speaking of."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So we are going to push through the XXX speed the cost difference is $71.15"" [Customer] ""$500.00 "" [Agent] ""And then did you still want"" [Customer] ""So that is how much more I am going to have to pay?"" [Agent] ""Mhm. For the XXX for monthly for the XXX, yes."" [Customer] ""A month or? So I was paying XX, so now it is going to be XX."" [Agent] ""Yes."" [Customer] ""So it is $21 more OK and then I want to do the fiber optics."" [Agent] ""So yeah, so I would have to first let them push through the XXX speed and then we can schedule the appointment for the fiber again."" [Customer] ""Yeah, so I would have to let them put through the XXX. So we are going to, so we are going to wait on the phone you are going to call me or"" [Agent] ""I am just waiting for her to push through the speed."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And then I can schedule the appointment for the fiber if you would like, OK?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, if it is not going to cost me nothing and it is going to be more reliable, why not?"" [Agent] ""OK. Well, the fiber is going to be a cost difference. It was like $100 more."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Did you want to hold off on that and see how the XXX works? Because the $500 the fiber is a cost difference, ma'am."" [Customer] ""And the XXX is."" [Agent] ""It is an increase in speed and increase in cost."" [Customer] ""Right, but I just felt like if I am going to lose one of the modems it will be cheaper, you know, like I am going to."" [Agent] ""If you uh if you cancel the additional modem, yes. Mhm and that additional modem you are paying like $155 for the base internet and then $15 for the modem."" [Customer] ""Mhm and that additional modem you are paying like $155 for the internet and then $15."" [Agent] ""So it just makes sense to upgrade to fiber maybe and just have one modem is what I am thinking."" [Customer] ""So it does not make sense to upgrade to fiber. Yeah, with the X lines on one modem, it is just a mess."" [Agent] ""Yes, so you are the additional modem is costing you $170 a month. With a XXX speed."" [Customer] ""The additional modem, yeah, yeah, yeah, so I definitely want to do that, yeah."" [Agent] ""With the XXX. OK, and then once the fiber is."" [Customer] ""My bill's not going to go over XXX."" [Agent] ""Once the fiber is installed, you can then get rid of that additional modem, OK, ma'am?"" [Customer] ""Once it is installed."" [Agent] ""Once the fibers installed, uh, we would have to set up an appointment for that."" [Customer] ""But when does."" [Agent] ""You wanted to push through the XXX speed in the meantime, so that is why I canceled the fiber, yeah, mhm, alright."" [Customer] ""That you wanted to push through the XXX. Yeah, while I wait, yeah, so no then when your survey guy comes I am going to ask him which modem I can take off if they do the all in one."" [Agent] ""Yeah, and, and it is going to be probably the old modem with the XXX speed. Because you have a very old modem so that is the modem you are probably going to recommend um just bear with me I am just going back to make sure the speed is pushed through for you, OK?"" [Customer] ""to Alright thanks."" [Agent] ""Sorry about that."" [Customer] ""Hello, I am uh trying to get it all on the right outlet for the customer."" [Agent] ""Yeah. OK."" [Customer] ""OK, so this one. It is going to go on number X."" [Agent] ""Mm."" [Customer] ""Let me make sure there is a. Mom Discount. Discount. XXX"" [Agent] ""And now she wants to set up the fiber upgrade again, Lord."" [Customer] ""X G. Carrotel. OK, so now everything is set up correctly."" [Agent] ""OK, and."" [Customer] ""And she should be able to get her XXX speed."" [Agent] ""Yeah. OK."" [Customer] ""And then her XXX speed is on the second modem on the account."" [Agent] ""And now the modem that I am going to upgrade is that primary modem to the fiber again. Lord Dana, hopefully I can do this."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""It took me forever, but I should be good because I removed a lot before, so hold on."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""You go in. No I I still have the SRO set up, OK, so. It should be pretty easy hopefully. Ms. Marsha, I am so sorry. Please just do not leave me yet just in case I have a problem."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Yes, ma'am."" [Agent] ""I am going to be quick, thank you. I know you are probably sick of me this morning, but."" [Customer] ""No, I am good."" [Agent] ""Well, thank you. Alright, so now the XX and the I do not know that is going to stay the HS will go the dollar sign, dollar sign, the IE OK, and it is here this is, this should be easy because fiber is only like X codes, so now go back to the fiber upgrade offers. And it is back to the you whatever. If we will give her the gift card. Why not?"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Because she is been on the phone so long. Hey, hit fiber, the rates did pop. Hopefully the rates do not not populate because sometimes when you do something and go in, that is another thing I noticed and now they are populating."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Is it?"" [Agent] ""So yeah, so the fiber rates are populating, um, the motor rental will go away, it will be replaced with the I whatever for the fiber modem. And the fiber one GB is there I was at the discount And hit next oh and the modem. Can get the modem so."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""A F is the discount. XXXX and then OK. Um Install modems up. I will just bring it all and then the modem with the voice lines, at least it is not giving you an issue with the multiple lines anymore. That is not an issue."" [Customer] ""Yes, because we got that fixed."" [Agent] ""It did make me change the GWs um before to GCs though for some reason."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""I do not know cause I think one is."" [Customer] ""GW, yes, because GW is a DNU now."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so that is going to be uh."" [Customer] ""Correct, yes, so that is why."" [Agent] ""I am just going to fix that because I know that is going to give me a hard stop on the next page. OK, so I put the F point. Which is I think the issue that I had the other day too maybe I did not select the right mode on when I called you guys, um, OK, so I fixed that to GCs x X. Cause yeah, the GW DNU yourself as that and let us see next. And let us see if it takes me to hopefully, Miss Marsha. I am on selecting, oh I need a secure rate rate code for fiber hold on"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""It was like a lot um. So secure. Mm, that is the this that it next. OK, I do not know why it is charging her XXXX. What is that? Oh, I probably hit the modem swap. Um That I I put a static IP here to take that off. That was an error. OK. Erabubo it said oh I did not remove the. Oh, it is giving me an error, so let us see. Missing OOL rate code of XXX because it has the X T."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""It is not recognized."" [Customer] ""The XXX was on there though."" [Agent] ""It is giving me an error with that, Miss Marsha. Mm. So everything is right. Everything it is taking all the fiber code. The that is not even the issue."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""The issue that I am running, I knew I was going to have a problem. I am so sorry, Miss Marsha. The issue is the The XT it is saying it needs an OOL rate code. Should I put one just for scheduling?"" [Customer] ""XX Yeah, you can, but it has the rate code of XXX at a non-chargeable."" [Agent] ""I do not know. Yeah, it is telling me that it must have, hold on, let us try it again. Yeah, that is the message that I am getting. So everything is good. But it is telling me. Try again. I got all the fiber rates and everything. It is saying something about the XXX."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Now I am getting a dumps track really. Is it OK, continue. OK. It is saying missing OOL rate code. It is a hard stop for me with the XXX. Let me show you. So all the rates for the fiber are right?"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Should I put. Should I change the age, the like, I do not know. Should I try to change it just the schedule to get her off the line you tell me I do not know. But I am getting that error."" [Customer] ""Yeah I would."" [Agent] ""Did I lose you, Miss Marsha?"" [Customer] ""No, I am still here. I was looking at this."" [Agent] ""Yeah, cause all my pending rates are good."" [Customer] ""I would try to schedule her. I mean, give her a date."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""And get her off the line and then we could work on it. Uh, I, I think I may have to share my computer with you and see what we can do."" [Agent] ""OK. OK, OK. OK, yeah, um. I am going to send you my rates uh. Let me just give her a date and tell her the $60 and then boom, get her off the line alright hold on."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And the fiber upgrade would only be $60."" [Customer] ""C however, once you Are you talking to me?"" [Agent] ""However, once you remove the additional modem of $155. Yes, so sorry, I did not want to keep you on the line anymore."" [Customer] ""Uh."" [Agent] ""So the fiber changes your monthly rate for the fiber would be $60 but if you remove the additional modem, you could actually be saving money and upgrading if that makes sense because we right now it is going to say your run for reoccurring charges is 5:30 with the upgrade, however, if you remove that XXX."" [Customer] ""Fiber would be $60 but if you. Um, you could actually be saving money and updating. Mhm mhm. You remove that XXX."" [Agent] ""You will be down to XXX with the upgrade."" [Customer] ""You will be down to XX. OK, but my thing is they, yeah, it does, but are they going to know that they can do that?"" [Agent] ""Does that make sense? Yeah, so we are yeah, no, so you are you would do this after the fiber modem is installed"" [Customer] ""OK. You you would do this Fiber modem is installed that change because we do not want to disrupt um so we have the survey for the XX we are going to keep that then we are going to do the 28th"" [Agent] ""You would not make that change because you are operational business. We do not want to disrupt, um, so we have the survey for the 22nd we are going to keep that then the fiber upgrade we are going to do is the 28th, correct, ma'am"" [Customer] ""Mhm X to XX then the survey, can you put my cell number"" [Agent] ""X to XX. Yes."" [Customer] ""I do not want them to call here and then I am in the street, uh, and put it in the account, um, XXX."" [Agent] ""Sure, what is your No worries. Sure. Mhm."" [Customer] ""XXXXXXX"" [Agent] ""Mhm. XXXX."" [Customer] ""XXX Yeah."" [Agent] ""OK, so just to recap, the change in the monthly rate for the fiber would be $60 no fee for the tech to come out and I did give you a $50 gift card with that offer that is one time placed on the bill, OK?"" [Customer] ""Yeah. Mhm."" [Agent] ""And then once the fiber modem is installed you can then get rid of the additional modem if you do not need it, OK so that you are not double paying because you will have a fiber connection here you will be getting X gigabyte down X gigabyte up"" [Customer] ""So. Yeah."" [Agent] ""It is double the bandwidth you are getting symmetrical speeds"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""OK, but my question is, is I am a bit confused if they do the fiber, would not they know that I would not need an extra modem?"" [Agent] ""So when they do the fiber upgrade, they would be possibly uh combining your fiber with your X phone lines then you have another modem for data"" [Customer] ""Or they Uh, combining Mhm."" [Agent] ""You probably do not need that additional modem for data with the upgrade, ma'am."" [Customer] ""Oh, I got it now OK."" [Agent] ""Do you understand now?"" [Customer] ""Mhm, I understand now."" [Agent] ""OK, oK. So right now what you have, let us just recap, you have X data modems and X modem with voice. X modems total. X internet, one voice."" [Customer] ""Mhm mhm."" [Agent] ""What the technician told you today was like, hey, why do you have this modem for voice?"" [Customer] ""Today was like hey, why do you up to XX lines."" [Agent] ""Cause we have modems that can accommodate up to XX lines. So basically, you can have."" [Customer] ""So basically you can have one modem with the fiber and the X lines on it."" [Agent] ""one modem with the fiber and the X lines on it, OK? And then that is going to be double the speed of both of your other modems."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""One modem you have a XXX speed, XXX down, XX up, which we do not even really sell that anymore."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Not even for home, we do not sell that speed."" [Customer] ""OK And then."" [Agent] ""And then for business, you have a XXX coax now because we upgraded that modem, XXX down."" [Customer] ""XXX down and."" [Agent] ""And XX up, which is a coax."" [Customer] ""This is a you are getting Mhm."" [Agent] ""With the fiber, you are getting X gigabyte, so double the speed. OK, down and X gigabyte up."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So symmetrical guaranteed speed, where right now you do not have guaranteed speed. Seems like you have like a lot of cameras and a lot of devices that connect to the internet."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""You have a smart TV you mentioned. So this is the best way to go all around."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I am surprised this was not mentioned to you when the tech told you to call in and upgrade. OK, and then, I know we have been on the phone for a long time, but"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""You know, you want to save money too. Another way to even bring down your Optimum account is by bundling your mobile service, because we do offer mobile now. So if you were to bundle your mobile with your Optimum business account, you can actually save $40 a month by switching over to our mobile."" [Customer] ""$40.00  Yeah, I know my mobile is XXX for X lines"" [Agent] ""Um, so you would say XX on the business account and if you were to do X lines with us, X lines, and you go to XX per line I believe hold on."" [Customer] ""I have my mobile for a long time. Mhm. with us."" [Agent] ""Oh, actually it is after X lines, so X lines it is XX times."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Or Yes, so it is T-Mobile is a network that we use."" [Customer] ""Yeah, so it is"" [Agent] ""I am not sure who you use for mobile, but the network that we use is T-Mobile. And you, yeah, so instead of paying T-Mobile, you would actually be paying us directly X lines would be XXX as well with Optimum then you are saving $40 on your business account"" [Customer] ""Yeah, I have the mobile. Yeah. And then you are saving. Alright, I will think about it because I have like a lot of long distance going on with these lines."" [Agent] ""Sure, I mean, can I email you in regards to the mobile?"" [Customer] ""Apart from that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, my email is there is brave I believe is the Picchito which email do you guys have"" [Agent] ""Alright, so It is the detail that we have."" [Customer] ""Theo, can you upgrade update it?"" [Agent] ""Sure, what is that?"" [Customer] ""Brave LXXX@yahoo.com."" [Agent] ""At yahoo.com."" [Customer] ""Oh yahoo.com awesome."" [Agent] ""Awesome. OK, so I will email you shortly in regards to that and my name is Dana."" [Customer] ""So I will email you shortly in regards to that and my name is."" [Agent] ""Is there anything else I can help with?"" [Customer] ""No, no, no, thank you."" [Agent] ""Alright, you have an amazing day I thank you so much for choosing Optimum"" [Customer] ""No problem bye bye."" [Agent] ""Bye bye. About that, Miss Marsha, did you want me to add the charging code for the modem and then we could take it off?"" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""Maybe that would be easier?"" [Customer] ""OK, yes, try that."" [Agent] ""Because it is telling me I need to have it. Does that make sense? Um, so I am going to change the X T to what is it HG?"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Alright, let us see. Or what is the, what is the modem, uh, I do not even, the, the, the XT."" [Customer] ""What the XX."" [Agent] ""I do not even know what this stand."" [Customer] ""It is not a XX, is it?"" [Agent] ""XX, I am sorry."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""I am telling them, I am saying the wrong thing. This is like, what is that? Dana? I definitely said the wrong thing cause they both are XXX so uh cause you know what, because"" [Customer] ""Mm"" [Agent] ""It is the same charge. It is not even changing the you know what I mean It is not changing the monthly rates. It is the same exact charge."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""XX and XT is the same rate it is $155 now, so it is not like it is less if that makes sense, it is the same thing."" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""Oh my God, I think we might have just found the fix, to be honest."" [Customer] ""Hm."" [Agent] ""Let us see if the hard stop still exists. No, XX minutes, it is just so crazy."" [Customer] ""Well, you found the fix."" [Agent] ""Yes, XT and yeah cause XT is XXX and XX is what is the same price and now the original XT is being changed to the fiber rate code right which we are sending a tech now the XT is going to be changed to XX with the ultra at XXX"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""And now it is telling me to change the DWs. Hold on because now I am in the outlet stuff I am past the hard stop Hopefully I can get the date that I recap with her. She said the 28th between the hours of X to XX. Miss Marsha, I did not even need to keep you on the line. I figured it out because I was like, is this what the idea is telling me to do because it is the additional yeah, so 28th is here X to XX"" [Customer] ""No, that is OK. Right."" [Agent] ""She said put her cell phone number XXX. XXX XXXX, X my gosh. I am so sorry I miss my show. That is what it is, yeah, because the X T."" [Customer] ""Well, at least. I learned something you learned something, so"" [Agent] ""Yep, we did it and her more her thing and her email is here to the brave yahoo that she told me to update that is all here."" [Customer] ""But that."" [Agent] ""I just want to make sure I did a proper recap, had her on the line and explain everything."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Look at that, Miss Marcia, sorry, I."" [Customer] ""And"" [Agent] ""Uh, that, that is all I needed was to change it and it is now changing the money, nothing."" [Customer] ""No problem."" [Agent] ""So everything works. Thank you. I am so sorry."" [Customer] ""You are welcome."" [Agent] ""You have a good day."" [Customer] ""That is OK. Thank you. You too."" [Agent] ""Bye bye."" [Customer] ""Bye."""

[Agent] ""You know, most businesses do not do a lot."" [Customer] ""Oh, that is very Yeah, they know that."" [Agent] ""Huh?"" [Customer] ""I work with uh files, you know, like if I need to load something, you know, I need to download I have the apps, so it is going to be very slow up to load."" [Agent] ""Mhm.""

Let us say for instance if I sold your car and I say this car is a VX, it has XXX horsepower and drive I am giving you XXX horsepower in reverse You are going to look at me you are going to say as a salesman, you are like, I am just selling you something because no one uses XXX horsepower to go in reverse You do not you do that. It is the same way with internet and uploading. If you have a document you want to upload to upload something extremely fast and let us say if you uploaded a book, you literally need something between X and X megabits of upload speed in order to, to upload a book. And so, and if you was on social media all day you posting pictures, you probably need about, you know, X or XX maybe upload, XX meg upload"" [Customer] ""Yeah, well that is. I have, I had um."" [Agent] ""I do not know too many businesses today unless you are like a social media company that uploads more than XX."" [Customer] ""Uh, I like. I am not I am not social media"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""But I have uh a server. I have my own cloud I have the, I am working with an account I work with a lot of things too I, I have like a Linux server"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""OK, and I have a Windows server. What are we going to be running there then we are going to be selling parts So let me say I have like XXXX customers looking for like a beautiful products over there and at the same time, so I need power."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Let us say everybody wanted to download a photo. Seeing my bad products, you know. So let us say I am starting selling cars. This car is very popular. A lot of people selling the same, the same time, and uh I am going to have a video there for example, you know"" [Agent] ""Mhm. Mhm."" [Customer] ""So that XX megabytes is like nothing, you know, like when you are talking about I am going to have a server installed there. So for me it is much better. I have like XXX megabytes upload and like $100 XXX gigabytes download because you do not need much to download anyway, you know. I do not work with social media, you know I work with servers so I need more upload and download because I don'tload something here or or twice"" [Agent] ""So"" [Customer] ""You know, let me say I would be like I want to do a backup from my other location, so I am going to download the entire thing every night."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""So like to make sure you know I have the file saved. So you are talking about like a I do not know like probably like XXX gigabytes of the zip file, you know, every night and uh if you give me like XX megabytes my set my my server is going to crash"" [Agent] ""Mhm. Uh, I do not know, but let, let me just check something while looking at your location here."" [Customer] ""You send it back up. You send it back up."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Everything crashes."" [Agent] ""I do not you"" [Customer] ""In my, I have my other location. I have Verizon. I have XXXX megabytes up and XXX megabytes down, but actually they give like XXX megabytes because every XXX, that is a lie, not really XXX like on the real day, the real action is those XXX sometimes it is just XX, you know, I can get better upset with Verizon files, the original size of sucks, you know what I mean."" [Agent] ""Right, um, let me just see something. I will tell you right now."" [Customer] ""Everybody says the writing is very fast, uh, OK, blah blah blah blah, but they do not give a word to to give like a real speed, you know."" [Agent] ""Yeah, I am no, yeah, I see what you are saying. Let me just see something, um."" [Customer] ""But you say social media, so put me as a social media."" [Agent] ""Yeah. Well, No, no, so the reason why I say that because most, alright, so here is, here is how it works. If you have a business server, the majority of business service, and you, you just to let you know, you will not be the first car dealership that we deal with. We have guys that have dealerships that have hundreds and thousands of cars that they post every day with videos and clients are going on their website to shop, and they, they have zero issue. So even if you have zip files and service, that, that does not mean anything a fast, powerful business class. Server, really, you technically need at least XX megs of megabits per second upload to run a few servers with high traffic. But the only difference is this, it has to be consistent."" [Customer] ""Yeah, but uh, I, I have a XX years going with the computer, you know I know a little bit I understand anyway, I do not have much time rather I just want to have like the cables installed there and the working, you know, give me like like my neighbor the XX, the XXXX box package is good for now, you know I discuss about packages later What I really need there is that right now at at least I have a computer because I am. I mean putting this thing together. I do not need the, the whole speeding, you know, right now, you know, and the the wireless you give me the simple device because you know I definitely want, I do not do nothing if I like just for myself phone in the printer or something like that maybe I do not know."" [Agent] ""OK, yeah."" [Customer] ""I do not know your package. I do not know how much you are charging for the, the, the.""

You will not get the, uh, the, the mobile line with it, and it will just be $60. That is the best we got for you. That includes the equipment."" [Customer] ""If I, if I do not have the equipment, how much you charge me if I can have my own."" [Agent] ""Well, we do not charge You, even if you have your own, it is still $60."" [Customer] ""It it is free?"" [Agent] ""We, we do not charge for equipment."" [Customer] ""OK, so the cheapest package you want to have is a XX box."" [Agent] ""That is correct.""

Call194,"[Agent] ""Thank you for calling Optimum Business sales and new Optimum Mobile. This is Alex. How can I assist your business?"" [Customer] ""Uh, well, I can tell you, you, you are going to assess my business, um, by. Uh, first of all, am I speaking to somebody in the US? That is where I start."" [Agent] ""Um, I am in the US, sir. How can I help you?"" [Customer] ""That is great, thank you very much because I have been, I have been keep getting put through to somebody in the Philippines, uh, and I can not understand half of what they are telling me and the half of the time it is incorrect. I have a an optimum account, um, and I. Have num numerous occasions called to try and reduce the expense of the of the uh of the service and part of the the the main part of the problem is um the uh there is a TV package associated with this thing, um, which I do not really use very much but. I, uh, need the, the new services, access to several new services, um, and I have asked, uh, you know I have requested that, uh you know, uh the main news channels and some overseas news channels as well, um, and The last person I spoke to who was in the uh in a Filipino call call centers I mentioned um I kept offering me these these these promotions and uh you know they, they, they did not lower the the expense at all. I I did not in fact they were the same uh as I. Uh, have been, uh, paying previously over the last X or X months which was way over $200 a month for a simple, you know, a simple communication service. Anyway, I spoke to this lady, she gave me, uh, uh, assurances that the plan that I would be put on to is, uh, $165 per month and that is an all in cost. I asked her to send me an email. Confirming that and I have not received any, you know, any email and this has happened to me before several times. So, um. Uh, you know, I wanted to speak to somebody in, in my local area or at least in the US or at least, um, and that is, uh, I think that is how I got, uh, got out to your number. It is a compromise or."" [Agent] ""So you are looking for ways to reduce the cost of the monthly bill, correct?"" [Customer] ""That that is correct."" [Agent] ""OK, so we could start with setting up a mobile account."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""um, first of all I am so sorry, is this for a business or residential services?"" [Customer] ""Well, it is, it is, it is, it is, I use, I use it for my business, um, but it is located in my, in my, uh, in my residence because I work from from home. It is very complicated, but I, I, I spend half my time in, in Europe and half my time in the US, um, on the defense and aerospace industry, so, um, yeah, it is uh it is important for me to be hooked up to new, to use the specialized news feeds, um. Uh, anyway, that is, that is the answer to the question. I mean, I do not know what, what classification that. That falls into."" [Agent] ""So you, you have the account the account is set up is a residential account. I only work with businesses, so we have a business and residential department for the same company. You, however, have a residence, so it is set up as a residential account you could be using it for your business or for many other purposes."" [Customer] ""OK. All right."" [Agent] ""However, it is, it is a residential account I will have to get you over to the residential department"" [Customer] ""Understand. That'll be fine. Thank you."" [Agent] ""You are welcome sir bear with me please. Since you are working from home, I will be more than happy to assist you in setting up a business account for your home. Um, all of our customer service and representative are based out of the US. Is that something that I could interest you in today?"" [Customer] ""Well, I mean, it would be interesting for me, but I, I I mean just to, to clarify I would not change any, uh you know, any basis of my service I mean, I, I, I need what I need is, uh, I need obviously need phone. I obviously need Wi Fi, um, uh I only need a very limited, uh, you know, access to, to these TV news, uh, uh, news feeds, so I mean I, I."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""I do not know if that makes sense or if that, you know, that falls into, you know, to the, to the area that you uh that you cover."" [Agent] ""So we could set you up with a basic Internet basic TV. How many cable boxes do you have?"" [Customer] ""I have, I only have X, just, just, just X."" [Agent] ""OK, so X cable boxes, basic television with phone and Internet, you are looking around $170 a month, sir."" [Customer] ""Is that, is that all is not all in? I mean, does that, that is not taxes and you know, the usual."" [Agent] ""It is already including all the fees and surcharges and equipment charges. The only thing that it is not included is the sales tax."" [Customer] ""Uh, and how much would, uh, how much would that be in my case, I am in the Connecticut area."" [Agent] ""Probably around X to $9."" [Customer] ""$69.00  OK, so, well, it sounds to me, it sounds to me that that might be the best, best thing to do, um. Uh, you know, provided, provided that uh, do you have to switch out different boxes or was this, um, how complicated you should."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so we will have to set you up with a full account I can waive that installation fee for you"" [Customer] ""It Well if I stay, yeah, yeah, yes, go ahead, go ahead."" [Agent] ""Because with the With a residential account it is considered an entertainment account so if you were to have any technical issues or anything that is going on with that part, um, it is still set up as a residence so you would not be a priority if the services go down or if you have any technical issues for us to get it up and running within XX hours versus a a business account, you know, we are obligated to get you up and running so you therefore you do not lose any revenue."" [Customer] ""Right. OK, uh, Quick question, how long does the switch out, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, take? I mean, physically what what what actually has to happen if I, uh, just switched over to a business account, which I am delighted to do but."" [Agent] ""Well, what I would recommend um. It is not to disconnect your residential services until our technician comes out there to set you up with a business account. Once they set you up with the business account, then you can call in and cancel your residential services. Therefore you do not lose any any um."" [Customer] ""Right. Yeah."" [Agent] ""Any internet or any time down."" [Customer] ""Right now, I was less concerned. I, I did not think that that would be the case. What I was less concerned about is that how long it was going, how long it would actually take because I am, uh, I am, I am off to, uh, India on a, on a, on a business trip, uh, on Friday. I am going to be out there for about XX days, uh then I am coming back to, uh, to the, uh, back to Connecticut on the I think we get back on the 4th Uh, then I have to, then I have to go back then I have to go to London on the, uh, first of July So, uh, you know, would be."" [Agent] ""Will anybody else be at home that is XX years or older?"" [Customer] ""Uh, no. Uh, so, and I, and I would not want to, I would not want to ask anybody. Uh, to come in either, uh, would, would, uh I mean, I, would somebody be able to come in and do this before, for example, this Friday, uh, which is the date I, I will leave her in there"" [Agent] ""We can definitely check and see what we have available."" [Customer] ""OK, so, um, before we do that, just to, just to, just uh so that I completely understand that, um. The, the business account would be, uh, would provide me with, uh, basic Wi Fi which is like which I have got already um on this uh residential account, the, the telephone, the landline, the, the XXX number that I have got, um, and this basic TV package with, with news feeds on it, is that, is that what I would get uh with, with the business?"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Account"" [Agent] ""Yes sir."" [Customer] ""OK. All right. So that is fine. That is, that is what I need. um, and, uh, and, and presumably, presumably not that it does not have anything to do with my business, but just out of curiosity, I I have got a, you know, pretty new Set of TVs. Both, both of them are smart TVs. They, they, I would continue to be able to to stream stuff through Wi Fi on those TVs that would not have any impact on that, would it?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, that is part of the that is part of the TV service when you buy the television."" [Customer] ""Yeah, that is, yeah, what the tele, yeah, exactly, the TV service, OK, so that does, it is not affected, it is not affected by changing it from a res from a residential to a business account."" [Agent] ""Mhm. No, no, no, no, it is, uh, every TV has a different, um, option on that like Samsung provides more channels than, than, uh, local TV when it comes to live stream. You know, that is something that that is part of the television."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, OK. OK, alright, fine, so, uh, no, no, that is great, thank you for clarifying that. Well, let us get, let us get a technician to come in and, and, uh. And uh tell me what uh needs to be done.""

[Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""OK, so including all the discounts that I could go ahead and offer as a multi-product discount, the installation would be a one-time charge of $100 and that gets billed out to you."" [Customer] ""So"" [Agent] ""And then the monthly rate for the service, including the gig speed of service, your modem, your router, your two phone numbers, um, again, of course your X static IPs, your connection failover service, and your premier technical support, the pricing structure would go ahead and be XXX. The taxes on the service would be $15 and."" [Customer] ""OK. Two things, X. Two things you can remove the thing uh the technical support thing you can remove you can also remove the uh failover"" [Agent] ""OK, so keep in mind that that is it."" [Customer] ""I need to be XXX, XXX uh XX range, you know I can not go that that much"" [Agent] ""I am listening. Understood. So keep in mind that the premier technical support assists with any networking assistance past the demarcation point and also trouble calls."" [Customer] ""That is fine. I have a backup Uh, no, ma'am, that I do not want to do that one."" [Agent] ""Understood, not a problem. I am just letting you know what it is and what the pricing structure includes and also the failover service is just that the main internet service ever goes down while we are up while we work on fixing it, then it switches over to the LTE network. If you wish for um to have me remove that from the service as well, I can go ahead and do that. OK, so that would bring the pricing down to, let us go ahead and take a look. Including the multi-product discount that would go ahead and bring the price down to XXX."" [Customer] ""XXX"" [Agent] ""That includes that includes the X static IPs. Keep in mind that the X static IPs is $30. And the second phone number is XX. So we are definitely in the we are we are definitely in that price point so you know if we were to go ahead and remove the static IPs and it is not something that you know you need the static IP."" [Customer] ""OK, OK. OK"" [Agent] ""If you want to take off the second phone number we can take it off and that brings the price down um by by XX $40 which is right in the price point where you are telling me that you need to be. But you know, you definitely see that you are going to need that additional phone number with your services. Oh, give me just a couple of seconds here. My apologies, my apologies, I did not remove a proper code here. My apologies here."" [Customer] ""I will give you one location. You know, I will give you one more location. Just, uh, can you, is there any way you can, uh, do something better price? I have one more, uh, place I need to. They already have optimum, uh, like, uh, that is uh optimum. You guys have, uh, someone, um, optimum connection in that area. If I give you one more location, is there anything you can do better?"" [Agent] ""OK, so first let me go ahead and fix the pricing structure. I apologize. I said it I said XXX, it is actually XXX, um, because we have to go ahead and factor in the, the static IP and the second phone number. So let me just go ahead and make sure we are on the same page."" [Customer] ""No"" [Agent] ""It is X it is $125 for the internet service and the first phone number. Add to that $40 for your second line. And $30 for your static IP, so that would be normally $195. There are discounts that I can apply to that, so that brings it down to $180. So that is where we are. So it is basically $200. Minus the $20 for the multi-product discount that brings it down to $180 so that is where we are right now. If you want to provide me the 2nd address, I can go ahead and ask my supervisor what we can go ahead and do regarding that."" [Customer] ""And OK, so the second address would be XXXX."" [Agent] ""I am ready for the 2nd address."" [Customer] ""Webster Avenue."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""So you go up I go from the bottom"" [Agent] ""And I am ready for the zip code?"" [Customer] ""Uh, but you have the right. Uh, zip code is XX. XXXXX."" [Agent] ""XXXXX. OK, so bear with me just a few moments while I go ahead and research this address, OK?

Are you on the 1st floor, 2nd floor? Where are you located at this location?"" [Customer] ""Uh, basement."" [Agent] ""In the basement."" [Customer] ""Hey"" [Agent] ""There seems to be already an active customer in the basement. Are there multiple suits within the basement?"" [Customer] ""Oh yeah, there is multiply. You can put first, yeah, because I know, yeah, you are right, because they, that, uh, the Chinese people are over there. Uh, I do not want to be, uh. I do not want to be next to them because I do not understand. They do not understand me. It would be a headache. Uh, I would rather go on, you can put first floor."" [Agent] ""OK, sit tight for me a couple of seconds. So it is the same customer the same company and everything?"" [Customer] ""Uh, uh, no."" [Agent] ""It would be a different."" [Customer] ""Well, your tax ID, uh, yeah, it is a different, different tax ID, different LLC."" [Agent] ""OK, oK, same same contact people, however."" [Customer] ""Yeah, contact people, uh, is all the same and um."" [Agent] ""OK.""

What I am saying, I do not know also the speed would be over here would be X gig"" [Agent] ""OK, so that would be the same seat that I am providing you at the other location. Cause the only difference is"" [Customer] ""No other location, how much do you?"" [Agent] ""Gig."" [Customer] ""Uh, other location one or?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, it would be a, yeah, I would, yeah, it would also be X gig because the only $10 difference between getting a gig and XXX speed, so it does not make sense for you because right now the way that we are doing it, it does not make sense for you to go anything lower than a gig right now."" [Customer] ""Oh, no, no, no. Yeah, right, one thing is that. Correct, correct."" [Agent] ""Mhm. All right."" [Customer] ""It, uh, uh, give me one second, take clip, take clip, uh, the litter we need to make, uh, the change. And the green part. It is OK No cable camera. OK with me, uh, one second, OK?

[Customer] ""X"" [Agent] ""So at this point in time, he was able to go ahead and bring the pricing down, including the following the X static IPs which you know is $30 including two phone numbers which are normally. $40 a piece. So just think that between those two things it is $40 plus XX plus $30 just within that it is $110 normally. So he was able to get you to the gig speed of service at $160 and if you ever want to do auto pay and paperless, that brings it down an additional $5 and a no charge installation for each of the location.""

Now what the static IP does is it allows your devices to connect with one IP address when normally the address, the address would be static or it would be different. So with the static IP it is going to allow you. To communicate uh directly with the network. So this is a lot of times used on the IT space and I am adding it to your promo as I am sure your IT team probably is going to ask for one in the future and this way it will be bundled in."" [Customer] ""Uh huh. Through your promo, I I am sure your IT team. OK."" [Agent] ""Now the great way about um our promos that is what I was going to just review that with you just to just to refresh your memory um this is you are not going to be under any contract so the services here it is going to be XXX even um for everything."" [Customer] ""Um, this is, you are not going to be under. So the service. It is going to be 2:20 even."" [Agent] ""There is a one time install of $100 um there would be no payment due so I know that you are um working on possibly whose name is going to be in maybe even possibly the installation date"" [Customer] ""Deletion so I wanted to let you know that I am."" [Agent] ""So I wanted to let you know that I am going to be able to schedule you for something you can make any changes because I will be the account manager uh just keep in mind"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""That there is no contract, so if you ever want to make any changes, if you want to ever want to add uh to your network or if you ever need anything else I will be your point person"" [Customer] ""That there is no contract. Uh, to your network or if you need anything else I It was"" [Agent] ""Now uh what I did want to, uh, button down with because I will get, you know, the tax ID whatever information once you confirm, you know with doctor or whatever, um, and I will remain in email contact with you What I wanted to know was, um, when did you um when did you think you want us to come by and, uh, have those services installed?"" [Customer] ""Um As soon as possible."" [Agent] ""OK, OK, so this week we have, we are just so bogged down, um, I was able to get approval for first thing, um, Monday which would be April 7th, so what I could do is I could, um, put you in there and um we would be an email correspondence like I said I would just need the tax ID and whatever um you are my point person on the account so if you want to add a doctor or something I could do that um the only thing I would need from you would be the tax ID remember there is no payment due."" [Customer] ""OK, so this week we have we are just. X. To um put you in there. You be an email correspondence like I said I would just need the tax ID OK. OK."" [Agent] ""Everything will be on a prorated bill and uh we do have some um some discounts. So if you signed up for auto pay, you will get a $5 discount and we also have Optimum Business Mobile which a few doctors' offices have been taken advantage of where you can get a cell phone with us or bring a phone over um and get an internet credit so you are able to get a mobile phone for the office that is up to you if you would like, um, but, um, just as it is, it, it will just be the $220 and there is a one time install and everything goes on a bill."" [Customer] ""Uh huh Right OK, um Now the XXX seems a little high. What exactly is the difference between like other internet providers for it to be that much more just so I can uh when I talk to them and we try to figure out what we are doing here."" [Agent] ""Well, for Well, so the thing about it is, right, based on what you are saying, I And looking at the interruptions in service. So those interruptions in service comes when you have too many people at the table."" [Customer] ""Uh huh. Right."" [Agent] ""So when you, when you have too many, you know, people at, at the table, then there is so much activity. That it is causing things not only to um slow down, but computers and the network communicate with each other. So if there is too much time in in receiving a response from the network or vice versa, then it just stops."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""So that is why you are noticing the drop off in services so I did give you, go ahead."" [Customer] ""OK Could that um Uh, I am sorry, could that also be why sometimes um they are losing their Wi Fi connections when we have got several people here because it is happening."" [Agent] ""Yes, so that is why I increased the network."" [Customer] ""OK I increased the network."" [Agent] ""I gave this is the fastest internet we have."" [Customer] ""I think this is the fastest."" [Agent] ""So even though this is a backup, if you wanted we could, uh, give you a lower internet"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So you know if we were to go with a lower internet you, you know, you could, you would save another XX bucks, so you would be at XXX"" [Customer] ""So you know OK"" [Agent] ""My thing is that. We can lower the speed of the internet."" [Customer] ""Uh huh Right."" [Agent] ""My thing is the communication, and that is why I added the static IP, which is going to allow them to communicate back and forth, not with any other traffic."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So just keep in mind that the, the XXX, this is our uh top internet if you want to go lower, um, you could get the, the XXX which is about XXX"" [Customer] ""OK, so just keep in mind that the, the XXX, this is our uh top internet if you want to go lower, um OK."" [Agent] ""So. What I am going to do is I am going to give you, um you know what I will give you the pricing on the XXX because that is what we can do since it is a backup we can go with the XXX and if you ever want to increase to the gig we will take it from there."" [Customer] ""OK, well they might want to go with that gig so I just, I wanted to find out the difference um in case of questions"" [Agent] ""Just give me a few moments to repackage it."" [Customer] ""I know we definitely want to do this. I am not sure what the name of the business or which um which offer until I talk to them."" [Agent] ""Thank you. OK, so this is what."" [Customer] ""So if we can go ahead um I can give you our tax ID if you can go ahead and put us on schedule for Monday"" [Agent] ""You got it."" [Customer] ""And then and then I will know here after I talk to them exactly which one we want."" [Agent] ""Um, what is that? Yes ma'am, um, what is the uh tax ID?"" [Customer] ""XXX XXX. XXX."" [Agent] ""OK, so it is XXX-XXX-XXX."" [Customer] ""XXX."" [Agent] ""XXX my apologies."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""OK, so Miss Cindy, I am going to update this I am going to uh schedule you for the 7th and then what I will do is I will send you a test email if you need to, um, you know, if you want to go to something else you want to add or anything else, then I will make that modification, no problem"" [Customer] ""And I am going to. OK, now keep in mind I do not have email right now because our internet is out."" [Agent] ""I am so sorry so this is what I am going to do"" [Customer] ""That is OK."" [Agent] ""So, um, what I would like to do is um, like I said I will still set everything up"" [Customer] ""Um, I OK."" [Agent] ""What I will do is I will call you directly because for me I do not have a direct line. I just have a queue I do not want you to get lost in that queue"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So what I would like to do from you is I have your phone number. I have XXX-XXX-XXXX I know you are at extension X."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""I am scheduling this for the 7th now for you and it is going to be X to XX."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Um, when did you want me to, uh, check in with you again?"" [Customer] ""Um, I should know something by this afternoon. I am waiting on our IT people, um, to get back with me then I also had one question"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""You said, um, this would give us a static IP address in the event. I do not know what that means exactly. I am not real savvy with all that stuff."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""um, if we would already have one, I was just, is that something I need to even ask our IT?"" [Agent] ""Well, I do not think you would, I would not doubt that you, I doubt that you have it. What a static IP is, is basically every um computer has an IP address."" [Customer] ""OK Your has OK OK."" [Agent] ""And when a computer communicates with a website or even um the network, the, the internet, it reads the IP address. So remember um you were saying that sometimes when multiple people are using it, the computer is having an issue."" [Customer] ""Times when multiple people are using it, the computer is having an issue. Yes."" [Agent] ""That there is multiple people there is multiple IP addresses"" [Customer] ""There is OK Computers instead of them saying communicate."" [Agent] ""So a static IP just gives one address so the computers instead of them saying communicating with different people, they are only communicating with one person. So it is less confusion everything is smooth"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Now, you could ask um your IT but they normally are the ones that are asking for a static IP. So I put it on there."" [Customer] ""Well, they always do at the computer. They will say what is your um ID and it is the XXX whatever, you know, we will give them as a separate thing, is that what you mean?"" [Agent] ""Right."" [Customer] ""Is that a little different, OK."" [Agent] ""Yeah, yes, so it, it is important to have, but again, if for whatever reason you feel you do not, you do not need it, we will, we will take it off. It is just based on what you said that this is something that is certainly a component of the service."" [Customer] ""OK, oK. No, that is probably why we are having such issues and they have put um. They put these, I do not know what they are, these little things hang from the filling for the wireless, I guess that is um something to. Pull the information throughout the area. I am not sure on our floor but they put these little things in for the Wi Fi."" [Agent] ""Yeah. Yeah, yep,"" [Customer] ""But that still did not help, you know."" [Agent] ""Exactly, exactly, because you need a real, uh, power, you need a real source. So it is like you can not, you can not share something, um, you know, and that is why it is not working because those those computers and all those people are trying to share something and, and it is just not enough food at the table."" [Customer] ""OK OK. OK."" [Agent] ""So what we are going to do is we are going to, you know, make the table a little bit longer we are going to have more than enough food"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""So, you know, nobody gets left out everybody has enough juice everybody has enough internet"" [Customer] ""Yeah, OK, this, you have been so helpful thank you so much and um."" [Agent] ""Yeah, you are very welcome."" [Customer] ""It educated me a lot with all this um."" [Agent] ""Not a problem."" [Customer] ""And I appreciate that. So I will find out um the name they wanted in and everything and then uh which program and I am, I, they probably will go with the higher."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Um The X gigabyte so."" [Agent] ""Yeah, because that is, you know, we always, um, want to give you the the best that um, you need based on your situation"" [Customer] ""Yeah, because that is, you know, we always, um, want to keep. But that that OK you could get to the doctor."" [Agent] ""The only other thing that I would need for you, Miss Cindy, I would need you to set a X digit pin. We call it an access code, and since you are my point person, so I would need you to create a pin that you can give to the doctor or whoever is going to call in, uh, other than yourself, and we will ask them for that X digit pin that you set, um, whenever they call in."" [Customer] ""OK, I will probably be the one that gets back with you. Uh, we will do XXXX."" [Agent] ""XXXX perfect so I am going to store that you are all set and I wanted to confirm I am in Eastern um Standard Time. Are you in the same time zone? Because to me it is it is about XX almost XX a.m."" [Customer] ""Yes. Um, yes. Yep it is XX:X so yep."" [Agent] ""OK, oK, perfect. So I am here for the long haul. I am actually here to about X p.m. today."" [Customer] ""I am actually here OK."" [Agent] ""Uh, when did you want me to reach out I know you said you are speaking with IT sometime this afternoon or something like that by the end of the day."" [Customer] ""I I have left him a message. I am waiting for them to call back and if they do not, I will call and try to get hold of them again. I do you have a direct line I can reach you?"" [Agent] ""So that is what I was going to say."" [Customer] ""I was transferred."" [Agent] ""I do not have a direct line. I have a queue I get tons of calls"" [Customer] ""Oh, OK, OK."" [Agent] ""That is why I have people email me. But what I am going to do for you because your network is down, I just wanted to see when possibly you wanted me to call you I do not mind if I have to call you once or twice or even X times It is not an issue, uh, Miss Cindy, because you have been so great."" [Customer] ""OK If you do not care to just try at X o'clock I will try to have everything done in"" [Agent] ""I just wanted to know when do you feel is a good time for me to reach out to you? OK, awesome awesome I appreciate you working uh so diligently."" [Customer] ""OK Oh, I appreciate you too."" [Agent] ""I will be in touch with you around X and other than that you are all set um for our tech to come by unless I speak with you you want me to make any changes This is going to be at XXXX Chesterfield Avenue XXX in Charleston, West Virginia XXXXX."" [Customer] ""Yes, yes."" [Agent] ""You will be getting uh the X gig gateway promo. It is going to come with the uh fail over and static. And also now interesting interestingly enough, I wanted to review this with you. All promos come with a phone. Uh, now this is not going to be a physical phone it is going to be a phone line."" [Customer] ""Uh, now this is not going to be a physical phone it is going to be a phone."" [Agent] ""Some people use it for a fax or an emergency line or or a system or anything like that."" [Customer] ""For banks or my emergency."" [Agent] ""So it will come with that and it is bundled in."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Uh, if for whatever reason, uh, you do not need, uh, the phone line, I can, uh, remove that and it will be a slight adjustment. I always just recommend keeping it on, uh, because I have clients that want to add a phone line later on and then they charge you for an install and they charge you for the phone when it will just come bundled in now."" [Customer] ""Uh They charge you OK, no, we definitely want to keep that that is good."" [Agent] ""You got it. You got it. So everything's going to be uh $220. There is a one time install of $100 again there is no payment due today"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""There is no payment due to the tech."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Everything will come on a pro-rated bill."" [Customer] ""OK, sounds great."" [Agent] ""Alright, now if you do not mind, uh, Cindy, not a lot of homework for you today, but I would like you to write down your account number because I usually email it to my clients with their access code, but since we are not doing it this time or right now I would like to give you that information."" [Customer] ""OK. OK OK."" [Agent] ""Alright, so your account number is XXXXX. XXX"" [Customer] ""XX."" [Agent] ""XXX. XX."" [Customer] ""OK, and if you do not mind if you could email that to me and then whenever it comes up I will have that information also."" [Agent] ""You got it, so I will send that to you posthaste, and I will, uh, speak to you again around X p.m."" [Customer] ""OK OK, thank you so much for all your help."" [Agent] ""You got it, Miss Cindy. Thanks for choosing Optimum, and I will talk to you later."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""You have a great day."" [Customer] ""You too bye bye."" [Agent] ""Bye bye."""
Call20,"[Agent] ""Good morning. Thank you for calling Optimum for Business now offering Optimum Mobile. My name is Dana. How can I help you?"" [Customer] ""Hi, um, I am looking for, uh, Uh, service, uh, from Optim uh, I will give you what I am looking for Can you count, uh, quote me, uh, how much it is going to cost?"" [Agent] ""Sure. Absolutely. What is the address of where you are looking for service so I can just make sure what you are looking for is available."" [Customer] ""XXX. Colombian Enterprise. Lara Park. New Jersey. XXXXX."" [Agent] ""Thank you. And this is the best contact number, sir, that you are calling from in case our call is disrupted."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""Thank you. And what are you looking for here?"" [Customer] ""I am looking, I am just looking at them on your website, so I need one. GP X G."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""I need X lines."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Um, X telephone lines and the and one static IP number that number I mean one static."" [Agent] ""One static IP got you. Alright, so bear with me and I will tell you, and then did you want to have auto pay sir with that or paper billing?"" [Customer] ""Yeah we can do a thing."" [Agent] ""You are OK with that, OK?"" [Customer] ""What can reduce my What can reduce bill always good."" [Agent] ""OK, yes, because, uh, alright, that works. I, I get that. Yes, autopay gives you a discount of $5 I should say. And then bear with me uh. X lines, correct?"" [Customer] ""For telephone line that is going to be fax line, but I think it does not matter."" [Agent] ""Yeah, uh, the nature of the line, you are absolutely correct, and just bear with me while I add it up for you so I will let you know what it is going to be, OK."" [Customer] ""Right uh X pack. Yes, thank you."" [Agent] ""And you said a single static, correct?"" [Customer] ""Yes, uh, can you tell me what, uh, what, uh right now we have single one just think I think single, what, what is, uh, like a single or two or whatever thing"" [Agent] ""The difference? Sure, so a single is XX a block of X would be XX if you wanted to go to a block of X static IPs So it is only a $10 difference than pricing if you wanted to do a block of X static IPs."" [Customer] ""OK, but But what, what is, I am talking about what is help, uh, for business, uh, not help."" [Agent] ""So basically a static IP address you could think of it almost like a phone number whereas a static IP is how uh one would find you um it is constant, it does not change so certain programs require a static IP so if you need to remote in you need like VPN access things like that, they would require a static IP address."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh. Mhm. Mhm OK, so for now let us do this just one."" [Agent] ""OK, and then if you were to do the X gigabyte speed, um, and then we add the static here as well. So you would be looking at XXX monthly. With the X lines, the X gigabyte internet and the static IP, and that is X gigabyte download, XX megabits upload, unlimited voice, you get unlimited calls to anywhere in the US, Canada, as well as Puerto Rico. All of your calling amenities included with that, as well as static IP, sir."" [Customer] ""Mhm. So it is when you said uh. Uh, for Uh, it is in, uh, uh, plus taxes and plus everything, right, uh."" [Agent] ""Uh, so that is $220 before taxes. Our system actually calculates the tax for you. So when you place an order, we could tell you exactly if you wanted to move forward what the taxes would be, it would be generated. There is only tax on the phone service. There is no tax on the Internet."" [Customer] ""Right, right. Well, how much approximately going to be?"" [Agent] ""I would say."" [Customer] ""Approximate."" [Agent] ""I am going to estimate maybe about $8 for taxes maybe. That is just an estimate."" [Customer] ""Mhm. So it uh OK so. So just if you can just split me this XXX it is like uh about like for internet how much is that for internet or for phone"" [Agent] ""It is a so it is actually a bundle uh with the the services you are actually getting a bundle deal."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK, this thing. OK, um."" [Agent] ""Are you already in the location? Do you have another provider here now?"" [Customer] ""No, I have Comcast right now , uh, but we are going to move, uh, to this package"" [Agent] ""Oh OK, yes, yeah, OK, so."" [Customer] ""But they, I do not think so. They, they are not providing service and."" [Agent] ""No, I, I see a lot of other active customers here. They have optimum service. So unfortunately with cable providers, Comcast could not provide service in an optimum area and vice versa."" [Customer] ""Right Right, right, this is why, um,"" [Agent] ""Optimum could not provide service in the Comcast area. Mhm."" [Customer] ""Uh,"" [Agent] ""Do you have a unit number here?"" [Customer] ""Uh, no, they did not give me. It is a plaza. It is like a lot of stores we have from this place."" [Agent] ""Yeah, I do see a lot of active. Some do not have unit numbers either. I see there is a chop that has service, uh, SNP Enterprises. Hi uh hibachi place, I guess I have. There is quite a few different businesses, Walgreens."" [Customer] ""Right"" [Agent] ""And Duncan."" [Customer] ""That is correct this is on the same file, yeah"" [Agent] ""And then when are you moving to this location if you do not mind me asking?"" [Customer] ""End of the month."" [Agent] ""OK, because nothing takes place until we physically, um, you know, send the tech out to install. So even if you set up an order, you will continue to have Comcast at your current location. And if we are keeping the Comcast numbers, then you would not, uh, cancel Comcast. we would take care of that if we are going to be reporting phone numbers to ensure that there is no lapse in service."" [Customer] ""Mhm mhm. OK, um. So this is the best uh right now for this uh what I am looking for right?"" [Agent] ""That is the best offer and that would be a X year price guarantee."" [Customer] ""uh."" [Agent] ""There is no contracts here with Optimum service. What I can do, um, to help you out is we do charge a $100 set up fee. I can waive that for you as a courtesy."" [Customer] ""Mhm mhm."" [Agent] ""And then all of this information that you are getting, you will receive it in writing so if for some reason you did not want to go forward with the installation or the appointment, you could always cancel an appointment. We have no contract, sir."" [Customer] ""Right, right, right, right. Um, OK, um, I am just uh"" [Agent] ""Especially if you need to be in by the end of the month. Sure."" [Customer] ""Uh, I am just, uh, Because I think my partner or somebody like uh called like I think to check. It is was like around $208 or something like that uh for this service, but maybe it is uh it is was in March. Maybe it was not uh. In April it change"" [Agent] ""You said uh XXXX. Um,"" [Customer] ""I think around this, uh, I have to check with her, but"" [Agent] ""So like an extra $10 off? I can take an extra $10 off for you then."" [Customer] ""I think this is what uh Uh, OK, and one more question about, uh, so we still like the business is still running on this location where we are right now."" [Agent] ""Yes."" [Customer] ""And uh can be set up let us say like internet already let us start it like uh and then when we on the day when we are going to move. Uh, we are going to be closed just only for X day or X days because Uh, we are going to transfer the phone."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""So my question, so can we set up like internet or we can start, uh, checking everything if it is, uh, working and everything, and then."" [Agent] ""So you can set up internet. The only thing with that is that you would need to send somebody back out to install the phone service and because we are reporting it would take a few days. So if you want to have the least amount of downtime, like, you know, with the phones I guess, because you could always forward calls during the transfer process like to a mobile, I would recommend to do the two services together"" [Customer] ""Right No, no, no, it is, uh, it is not last day we decided last day uh, because we are on the contractor on the last, uh, week of the"" [Agent] ""So when is your last day in your current location? OK."" [Customer] ""Of the like renovation week we have we have to meet we have to close so we are thinking about like XXXX I thought uh not I thought like I want to"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Uh, everything set up before we are going to move, you know, this way, but, but."" [Agent] ""Oh OK, so we could, so what do you need to keep the same numbers that you have with Comcast? You need to port numbers as well?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, our main number for XX years already it is uh."" [Agent] ""OK OK, so what I would do in that case so you can get the bundle pricing is I would you could do two things You could set up an order with Internet you could do like temporary numbers then you can port your Comcast number after you could always forward calls on the instruments so your Comcast number is ported, especially if you want to get in to make sure everything is up and running"" [Customer] ""Right, right, right, right, right, right. So we can do this temper and then they charge for."" [Agent] ""And then we can put your Comcast, um well, you are not being charged for the installation I, I told you I could waive that for you as a courtesy so."" [Customer] ""No, no, not for installation. I am talking about when you switch the number from your number to my number what we have for you one time."" [Agent] ""I can give you my email and you can email me when you are ready to do that."" [Customer] ""No, I mean, I mean, I am ready. I, I mean that is why I am calling right now."" [Agent] ""No, no, no, no, but you said you are still using the number in the other location, so you are not ready to port that number, yeah, so you are asking if do we charge when you are ready to port the number usually we do charge for a port I can follow up with you and port the number after if you would like"" [Customer] ""Oh yes, yes, correct. OK, OK, I understand. So it is good to know, OK."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""OK, so what do you, uh, if we are going to set, set up everything, what do you need from me or what information?"" [Agent] ""What I would just need um well let us start with the name of your business that you would be setting this up under."" [Customer] ""OK, go to, uh, I can spell it to you or um.""

[Agent] ""Uh, it will not take that because it is not unique enough, uh, like like a XXXX or something."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK, OK, let us do the uh XXXX."" [Agent] ""OK, and then what we ask this for say if you were to call in or Katherine for example and say, hey, you know, I wanted to cancel my Optimum account, we would say what is the last X of the tax ID or the X digit pin you selected so it is just the security feature we do not do anything with it."" [Customer] ""Right, right, right, so, uh."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Let us do this uh number what I just did. Oh this get."" [Agent] ""The 19, XXXX, yeah, I just was letting you know what you would be asked for then I know you were looking for the internet, the phone, and the static IP We also offer mobile. I do not know if you and your partner have like another solution for mobile, but if you were to bundle your mobile phone, you could actually save $40 a month on this account by switching over to the Optimum mobile because we have unlimited talk and text, so we have, uh, mobile plans as low as $45 a month then you would save $40 on your business account And the network that we utilize there is T-Mobile."" [Customer] ""To be honest with you, we do not, uh, use the, I mean, we do use the software, but everybody, uh, have own, uh, my workers have all."" [Agent] ""OK, but if you ever wanted to even, uh, you know, expense your own personal cell phone, you could, and then save $40 on your business account, especially now a lot of doctors are texting like my dentist sends texts."" [Customer] ""Uh OK, OK."" [Agent] ""They know a lot of places they are doing the text option now too, so it is just something to consider for the future. Mhm. And then what we are going to do now is then you will see in the confirmation email that I did not charge in uh installation. I waive that for you, OK? And then I am also going to send you a test email because the confirmation email, sir, is going to come from Optimum directly, OK? I am going to send you an email from me."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So when you are ready to port the Comcast numbers you could just reach out to me directly, OK?"" [Customer] ""Right, right, but you can send me now email. I can be able to see, uh, your, uh,"" [Agent] ""OK, I am sending it to you right now."" [Customer] ""What number or uh name or."" [Agent] ""I am sending it right now. I am sending a test email. Because I just sent you a test email and that should come from Dana. Let me know when you receive that."" [Customer] ""Not yet."" [Agent] ""Mm, it was just done at 8:47 so maybe it takes a little bit of time. I sent it to the email that you gave me, the Co optical X@gmail.com."" [Customer] ""I, I double check uh the name. It is C O H E N S. OPT I C A L."" [Agent] ""ICALX@gmail.com."" [Customer] ""X Yeah"" [Agent] ""It says, yep, number X says delivered on my end. Um, so maybe give it a minute."" [Customer] ""Are you? I am not sure, yes, I just got it."" [Agent] ""Yeah. Mhm. No worries. So what is going to happen is when the tech comes out they are going to install the internet, the X gig, the static IP, the X numbers, and then they will get temporary numbers and then when you are ready to move over your main line you could just email me and say Dean I am ready to port the number. Just do not cancel it, um, with Comcast because we can not port a number that is not active, OK sir?"" [Customer] ""Right, right, right."" [Agent] ""Yeah, that is very important information for me to tell you and the number that you are porting from Comcast is XXX."" [Customer] ""I I just have to email you, right? You do not have a phone number?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, just email me and I will call you. No, I do not."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""I am in a call center if you email me I will call you, OK"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, no problem, no problem Oh wait, let the."" [Agent] ""Um, and I am here Monday through Friday from, you know, X to X. I can give you the number to the call center, but then you would just get another representative, but I will give you that anyway in case you need tech support, billing. I always like to give customers this number. I am not sure what number you used to reach me I would like to give XXX"" [Customer] ""I know right now I was not."" [Agent] ""No worries, take your time, sir."" [Customer] ""OK, I am ready."" [Agent] ""XXX"" [Customer] ""Yeah"" [Agent] ""XXX"" [Customer] ""Is that No, no, my family does not take X 2nd."" [Agent] ""OK, let me know when you are ready."" [Customer] ""Yeah. OK, uh"" [Agent] ""So by Mr. Raman. OK, so it is XXX uh-huh XXX."" [Customer] ""That"" [Agent] ""XXXX."" [Customer] ""XXX."" [Agent] ""XXXX sir."" [Customer] ""OK. OK, I got the numbers."" [Agent] ""OK, and then I can have somebody come out for you as early as tomorrow to the new location."" [Customer] ""Yeah Uh, tomorrow."" [Agent] ""And then we also have weekends available in this area so if you want to look at your calendar and tell me what works."" [Customer] ""No, no, uh, no, um, it is uh Mm. No, tomorrow is not a good day. We have meetings all day. Uh, let me see. I have to, uh, let me ask you the general question like um, the technician's going to come in"" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""Uh, going to show him when he going to where he going to install uh the."" [Agent] ""So he usually um advises like the best place to look for the demark location within your business because the whole plaza looks like it has optimum service um so they can work with you."" [Customer] ""This OK."" [Agent] ""I always advise customers not to sign off on any work orders or anything like that until everything is to your liking. So you can work together. Um, I do not know if you want to be there or if you have contractors there, if it is, you know, I mean we are flexible in terms of the dates."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I, I do have, but I have to be there and right now over there really like not because they still they uh, they said like in the end of the week they are going to."" [Agent] ""OK, so do you want to go into next week then?"" [Customer] ""I am just uh thinking about this you know what, uh Donna, let me. Let me, I have everything you have. Do I need to sign up anything or just get it, uh, or, OK, that is going to tell me what."" [Agent] ""Sure, I mean, so I can take like a payment, uh, like I am not taking a payment I can sign you up for auto pay or you can enroll in autopay yourself, but if you do not enroll in autopay with me, then the confirmation would say 2:15 it would be less the auto pay discount. I know you are not sure about the date, so like what we could do is we could set a date for next week and if you need to move the date up, we could always do that as well."" [Customer] ""Right, right, so."" [Agent] ""And at least this way you would have everything here."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I will say, uh, let me open my calendar. This is X Monday. XX OK, no, no, let us do this way. I can email you. I can, uh, we are going to, I am going to see my partner here later today."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""And we will decide uh with her what day is good when I am going to be available there because I have I want to be there we will see like because today tomorrow we will have uh a lot of things uh like uh"" [Agent] ""So I have tomorrow but then we go to the weekend we have Saturday, Sunday, and then we have Monday that is why I said we are into like the weekend and next week, so you could always set a date if tomorrow does not work we can always change it. I know tomorrow is too soon so it does not work we are scheduling into next week"" [Customer] ""But XX, OK, Donna, let me just look clear, so you said for tomorrow or it is going to be uh next week."" [Agent] ""Or the Saturday or Sunday, the 12th or the 13th."" [Customer] ""It will This is what you this is what you see, uh, on your calendar what is up"" [Agent] ""Yes, mhm."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK, OK, OK."" [Agent] ""As I said, the weekend is available as well because we have Saturday and Sunday like all full availability right now, so it is a live quota we all schedule it from it. Um, Saturday I could tell you, hold on, because the time frames vary. That is why I said you could always change the date. You can just email me Saturday I have X to XXXX to XX to X, and then Sunday I have X to XX, X to X."" [Customer] ""X to XX OK. Um, I am just so worried I do not want to miss like tomorrow you said you have one appointment also so uh then what"" [Agent] ""Yeah, so tomorrow I do, but it is a live quarter we all schedule it, so just because it is available now does not mean it is going to be available later."" [Customer] ""No, no, I am talking about, um, it is better you can call me like I will call her right now and double check can you call me on this number in X minutes"" [Agent] ""OK. Sure, I absolutely can I could even conference her in if you would like Or you prefer to call her?"" [Customer] ""Or you can You can actually maybe stay fine."" [Agent] ""Uh Sure."" [Customer] ""Maybe I can, I will ask her a question I will tell you"" [Agent] ""No problem Mr. Bergman, I am on your time. Take as long as you need."" [Customer] ""OK. Hello?"" [Agent] ""Yes.""

[Customer] ""And uh OK, X to X, uh."" [Agent] ""And Sunday I had the X to XX and the X to X. I did not have that midday option. XX to XX right now."" [Customer] ""Or No, let us, uh, do X to XX. Well they, um, is it the pro, uh, they can call me before they can come in or they just uh."" [Agent] ""Yes, they, they do call. They need to, I can have them call you half an hour before."" [Customer] ""Because I am actually, I, I am XX minutes, yeah, it is great because I am XX minutes away from this location I live."" [Agent] ""OK, so I will have them call you for access."" [Customer] ""So, uh, it can be. Right, and I can be there, uh, if they can call me half an hour it is going to be good, perfect."" [Agent] ""I can have them call you half hour so this way you have ample time, sir. And they also text like usually if if you are OK it would not be um advertising it would just be like appointment confirmation like the tech is XX minutes away that type of thing"" [Customer] ""Right. So can we put X to XX or it has to be X to XX?"" [Agent] ""So it is X to XX is a time frame?"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I could put customer would like after X, but I can not guarantee. If I could try to get you an XX to X, would that be better for you?"" [Customer] ""Right. Uh, no, no, no, let us leave it in the morning."" [Agent] ""OK, because I could try to escalate to see."" [Customer] ""Just if you can put like a note like if a car and prefer if not of course it is fine that from."" [Agent] ""OK, because it is Sunday I understand."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Which is is great that we have because a lot of areas we do not have uh weekends for some reason in this area we do have Saturday and Sunday available"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""And then um how did you want to enroll in auto pay with a card or with the check?"" [Customer] ""Uh I think with the card. I have to give you now information this or uh"" [Agent] ""Yes, or unless you want to enroll yourself then if you enroll yourself then the confirmation email would say $215 instead of $210. I did give an extra $10 off, but it includes the $5 auto pay so you tell me if you want to enroll yourself, you guys can."" [Customer] ""Right, right."" [Agent] ""It is up to you."" [Customer] ""No, no, no, I, I like, I can do this with you, but, uh, maybe later today or tomorrow because anyway we have installation only on Sunday if possible I can contact you"" [Agent] ""OK, so you want to email me then I can enroll you in the auto pay"" [Customer] ""Right, right, right, right, you, I can email you like a call me, let us say something like that and uh and we can because I have to prepare, uh.""

And currently the promotion also comes with our backup Internet, our cellular backup, so that would be included as well, uh, right now with the X gig speed tier we have a X year promotion monthly rate would be XXX."" [Customer] ""Mhm. I OK."" [Agent] ""It will be a one time install fee.""

[Agent] ""Yeah, that is no problem. So with the X gig speed here, it is a X year promotion. It comes with our cellular backup internet. So for example, if you ever have any outages in the area, it would automatically roll over to a cellular backup. So that way you will never lose business and you could be able to check out any customers or anything like that with the X gig speed monthly rate would be XXX. It is a X year promotion no contracts And a one time install fee for the technician to come out and install the service, a one time install fee of $100."" [Customer] ""All right, then we will be 1:30 for X years."" [Agent] ""Correct, no contracts. If you are looking for something possibly a little longer, we do have a X year promotion as well, same thing no contracts with the X year promotion, monthly rate would be XXX But you have got the price locked in for X years, same thing no contracts, but your your price is locked in for a longer time"" [Customer] ""OK.

[Agent] ""Yes we do. I was actually going to bring that up to you. So for example we have the mobile line, right? Um, you can actually save an additional $40 on your internet bill when you have the cell phone line set up. How many lines would you be possibly interested in one or two so I could give you a price quote with that as well?"" [Customer] ""OK. I. XX."" [Agent] ""Only one? OK, so the mobile line, for example, is $45 a month. You get unlimited talk, text, and data with that, and that is our starting line. And after X months of having the mobile service set up on your internet bill, you get a $40 credit. Monthly, so that would drop your let us say if you go with the XXX plan for the X years. Your monthly bill would drop down to $90 with the monthly, uh, with the mobile plan and then with the mobile plan it would be a separate bill."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""That bill would be $45 and that is if also you bring your own, your own cell phone over. Do you have a phone that you would be interested in bringing over to us or possibly leasing a phone?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, we have a phone."" [Agent] ""Oh perfect."" [Customer] ""So let me just make sure that I. So, after X months, the bills are going to come down for $90 plus the $45 because it is going to come in two separate bills, right?"" [Agent] ""Correct."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK. Give me one second."" [Agent] ""Yeah, take your time."" [Customer] ""Mhm. The up is it? question It was. So. I think. No, it is fine to have. For massage and son. All right. uh, we are going to take only the internet for now."" [Agent] ""OK, that is no problem. So let us go ahead and pick a date and time. Uh, also, what X digit security code would you like to use for the Internet?"" [Customer] ""the number that is."" [Agent] ""You can use for example like the address you can use the year."" [Customer] ""Oh. Mm Alright, uh, let me write this stuff first. All right, 11:05."" [Agent] ""XXXX perfect. And any particular day you have in mind for us to come out and do the install or just as soon as possible?"" [Customer] ""That sounds possible."" [Agent] ""OK, so we have tomorrow available we have Wednesday."" [Customer] ""What time tomorrow?"" [Agent] ""Between either X and XX or XX to X."" [Customer] ""XX to X No. XX to X."" [Agent] ""XX to X and what is a good number for the technician to call and let you know that we are on our way?"" [Customer] ""XXX-XXX-XXX"" [Agent] ""Perfect thank you and would you like to set up auto pay today?"" [Customer] ""Not right now thanks."" [Agent] ""No problem, so keep in mind the promotions also include a $5 auto pay discount. So for example if we do not set up the auto pay today monthly wait would be $135 but if you set it up a week from now, a month from now, it will drop back down to the $130 the $5 will automatically come off and. You gave me the number. Perfect. OK, just give me one more second here."" [Customer] ""Hello?"" [Agent] ""Yes, I am sorry I am still here, just give me one second"" [Customer] ""Hello. OK, oK."" [Agent] ""OK, so everything is set for tomorrow between XX and X technician is going to give you a call about XX-XX minutes before arrival. Your monthly rate without without the auto pay is XXX. When you set up the auto pay, it will drop back down to the XXX. And the one time install fee of the $100 will be on the first bill."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So for example, nothing is given to the technician tomorrow. Everything is on the first bill. And one quick question if you mind me asking, any concerns you guys had about the mobile line? Was it the price any issues you have"" [Customer] ""Yeah, the price."" [Agent] ""Because we do have other options for the mobile plan. Our most popular plan is the unlimited. For the $45 monthly, but we also have a X gig plan that is $25 monthly you would still get the discount towards your So instead of it being um $45 unlimited talk, text, and data. You would get X gigs a month."" [Customer] ""So if I I, they also apply for the, the internet bill to come down to XX after X months."" [Agent] ""Correct, even with the XGB."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So that one once again you get X gigabytes a month of data instead of unlimited."" [Customer] ""The XX then."" [Agent] ""OK, so you want to do that one?"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""OK. So let us go ahead and get this one set up for you now you said you have your own phone?"" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""OK, perfect.

Alright, I am getting the installation waived for you be just a second. Alright, I got that on there. I got you a free upgrade there. No one time charges. I want to upgrade you. Yeah, because the, the, the reason why I asked about your cell phone on notice because with us we also um offer cell phones we are in um the with the team, the T-Mobile towers and with the $500 you get $20 off of your internet bill when you sign up with our mobile, uh, with our mobile plan. I have um a unlimited plan at $45. But you honestly just be paying $25 for it since you get $20 discount on your internet and you always have that as long as you have both services. Does that would that would that help you save?"" [Customer] ""So you are saying uh instead of it being XXX. It would be XXXX. Oh"" [Agent] ""So it is $120 if you sign up for autopay and paperless, so, so from $120 you are going to do plus $45 so that is XXX minus $20 so you will be paying $145."" [Customer] ""And that includes the business and my personal, right."" [Agent] ""That is right and what is great about it is uh what kind of phone do you have?"" [Customer] ""I have an iPhone XX, yeah."" [Agent] ""Uh iPhone. OK, perfect. So with the iPhone XX you have X, you have a total of X available SIM slots. So right now you are using one of the SIMs right now for the telephone number that you currently have. So if you wanted to, um, I can, uh, you have, you have a couple, we have actually a couple options I can get you a brand new number, get you a SIM card if you go to your settings And go to general"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""And then go to about there is going to be uh IMEIX so you can have two numbers on that one phone."" [Customer] ""Mm."" [Agent] ""So you do not have, so, so technically you do not have to have two physical phones. You can just have XX physical phone with two numbers on there you can separate your business life from your personal life"" [Customer] ""Got you."" [Agent] ""And then and then when and then if you if you ever want to go away with that prepaid. You can just call us up and you can keep that same number or we can do it today or you can just disconnect that one and just have one. Or just use, I mean, what is cool about the prepay you just do it whenever you need it you do not have to do it every month, right?"" [Customer] ""Gotcha."" [Agent] ""You can go a couple of months without it if you really want to."" [Customer] ""No, it is a, it is a month it is a monthly. It is a monthly thing like $25 a month."" [Agent] ""Oh, OK."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Well yeah I mean if you want to go away from that you can keep that same telephone number, keep that same cell phone. I will send you a SIM, um, and then you will get the same information it will be through email so it will get you a lot quicker, um, and then on that the only thing you will pay for that one is the activation fee which is like $20 and some change."" [Customer] ""Of course, yeah."" [Agent] ""And that is it."" [Customer] ""Um, Thank you for offering me that, but I think I am going to just, just, uh, I will, I will get back to you on that if anything."" [Agent] ""Yeah. Yeah OK, cool, no worries, as long as you know we can help you save."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, yeah, cause I heard them all, yeah."" [Agent] ""Um Yeah, but, um, if I see that if you wanted to, I think the XX is the best deal, you know, for being in the modern times because unlimited talk text and internet is the most important on the phone, but I do have a X gigabyte premium data, which is only $15. That one is unlimited talk and text."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""But it is not unlimited internet. But as as long as you are connected to the to the to the Wi Fi the majority of the time of the day."" [Customer] ""I got you."" [Agent] ""Then you may not need that unlimited data."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""And it is just XX bucks for that cell phone."" [Customer] ""Um, no, that is OK. Thank you for offering though."" [Agent] ""You got it, Arnold."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""So it will be, so your new monthly bill will be XXX when you sign up for auto pay and Pedroli. Uh, without it it is XXX.

XXXXX. Sorry about the wait, but just a second."" [Customer] ""No, you are OK."" [Agent] ""Trying to see if I can make some room for today one moment. OK, it looks like they are overbooked until Thursday. Thursday the 22nd, so this Thursday coming up I can get you in in the morning between X and XX, and then in the meantime if something becomes available between now and Thursday I can have them call you and they can get you squeezed in, but Thursday would be the day right now.""

We had removed an internet service from our bill because we were not sure what modem it was speeding. We did not think it was being used. Turns out it was being used, so we are hoping to switch that back on. We still have the modem and like everything's still plugged into it. My coworker had said they had tried turning it on Saturday, but there were issues with that, so I am not sure if you can turn it on remotely if we are going to have to have a tech come out."" [Agent] ""That is OK, and what is going to be the address of where that is located?"" [Customer] ""It is XXXX Jefferson Street in Hoboken, New Jersey, zip code is XXXXX."" [Agent] ""And what was your name?"" [Customer] ""My name is Harley Coffey."" [Agent] ""And Harley if we get disconnected, what is a good call back number for you?"" [Customer] ""Uh it is XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Agent] ""And any chance do you know the X digit access code on this account?"" [Customer] ""It is 10:28."" [Agent] ""Yep you got it perfect. Let me see, everything is still plugged in though from when you guys, uh, disconnected that Internet."" [Customer] ""Yeah, so when the tech came by we had upgraded our other router and then all of a sudden like when we upgraded it, the Wi Fi in our lobby no longer worked, so when the tech came he Did a little more digging and we were in the ele the electrical room and he had turned off what I believe is this modem with the additional internet service that was feeding our call logs so everything's still plugged in. He did it through his phone it looked like or it seems and my only thing is if we turn it back on is if our lobby Wi Fi will go out again."" [Agent] ""OK perfect."" [Customer] ""I am not sure what like um."" [Agent] ""What caused that change, yeah."" [Customer] ""What is going on over there, yeah."" [Agent] ""Now what I will do on my side is just make sure I am not turning off any current uh current internet. we will just add to what you guys have."" [Customer] ""OK.""

[Agent] ""And we made that change was it like last week?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, I think we took it off the bill like the guy because we had multiple technicians come out. He, I think he removed it off the bill. Maybe Wednesday or Thursday and then the actual technician when things were not working was here on Friday and I think that is when the modem was actually turned off."" [Agent] ""Friday OK. Now just in case, no extension on this is that XXXX ending?"" [Customer] ""Uh, for the model."" [Agent] ""Uh, for the telephone number, just the XXXX no extension.""

Um, and then once everything gets ordered and then we move that XX days up, but I would have to set you up with analog now and then we can work on the process. I can send you over our form, our prices then we can go deeper into like the actual process itself"" [Customer] ""Um, I guess, uh, I thought one thing at a time just so I guess, um. Could we proceed with this and then since just since then we will be comfortable at least knowing uh we can move what we have now, then we can uh review that and you can send me the prices and then if we want to we can proceed with that as like kind of a migration after we move kind of thing."" [Agent] ""Yeah, that is what I was going to, that is why I offered to send you the email so you could really look over all of our phones that we offer, um, and like what works best for your business like our list of features that comes with our voice over IP so."" [Customer] ""Perfect. Awesome thank you perfect perfect."" [Agent] ""Yeah, and you have a toll free number with us as well?"" [Customer] ""Uh, do we have I know we have X numbers I am actually in the portal right now, um."" [Agent] ""I see that you are, you are being charged for a toll free number."" [Customer] ""You probably"" [Agent] ""Let me pull it up."" [Customer] ""XXXXX-XXXXXX. Give me, let me just triple check on that."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Um, yeah, I mean, I, I see we have not used it in a very like I see no minutes used or anything. I do not. I do not think we need a toll free number."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Um, Let me, let me just double check one more minute with even someone else. I am so sorry, one moment."" [Agent] ""No, you are fine. Take your time."" [Customer] ""Uh, we, yeah, we actually, uh, we do not need that toll free number anymore."" [Agent] ""OK. OK OK, so then with getting everything set up looks like right now we can offer the the X gig internet with a X year price guarantee including those three phone lines. It looks like at just $130 monthly. But I did want to mention to you that we have a new device called the connection backup so if you ever had a power outage or an Internet outage this turns on automatically to support your devices and right now I can offer that at just an additional $10 so it bring it to $240."" [Customer] ""And how does that um. Work exactly if you do not mind."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so it is a X XG wireless backup, um, so it is kind of like a hotspot that you connect to your modem and if it notices that the power goes out on your modem or that if like your modem shuts down for any loss of internet, it turns on automatically. You have already got your major devices set to the password on it so that when it turns on your devices just immediately switched to it."" [Customer] ""Is it mobile too, so even like for instance until we get things set up on the 31st, like if we want to run there we like use that currently? Right."" [Agent] ""So, so it is not really like a mobile device, uh, it is more or less just connected as like a backup to your modem. And if we install your modem it is also going to be installed so you should have internet over like if we like get this set up with that device. You would have the Internet as well."" [Customer] ""OK, and uh it was 2:30 before that and then it would be 2:40."" [Agent] ""Mhm yes sir."" [Customer] ""OK, let us do it and like we are getting the modem router combo, right?"" [Agent] ""Yes I"" [Customer] ""If we wanted to, is there a. Why should we utilize the speed that is coming in as well?"" [Agent] ""Mm I am not sure on that one. I have not been asked that question. It has not been a question that is been kind of like popped up like you are trying to see if you can use that as well as the Internet."" [Customer] ""Oh, basically, like I just want to make sure we are going to be able to put the modem router into like bridge mode."" [Agent] ""Yes, you should be able to put the modem and router into the bridge mode."" [Customer] ""They like that Uh yeah, that is what I want to make sure to make like when we have our own router. OK, cool, like a, you know, we are going to get like a business router."" [Agent] ""Yes. Of course."" [Customer] ""OK cool."" [Agent] ""And then let us see. I have the 31st available, um, as well as the 30th available both of those days I have an X to XX or XX to X."" [Customer] ""Um, the 31st you said?"" [Agent] ""Mhm. That is a Saturday, yes sir.""

[Agent] ""Let us see, who do you have your cell phone with?"" [Customer] ""Uh, it is currently with Verizon."" [Agent] ""It is with Verizon, and can I ask how much you pay monthly with them?"" [Customer] ""Um, I would have to triple check on all of that. Um, I am definitely, um, interested, I, I will call back another time. I just, um. Um, Yeah, currently we are OK to stick with them."" [Agent] ""OK, I will email some some of our discounts and promotions we have with our Optimum mobile right now, um, when I send you over that voice over IP information."" [Customer] ""Yeah. Uh, maybe"" [Agent] ""Of course, and then let us see, so I have got you scheduled for the 31st between X and XX. It is going to be set up with our X year price guarantee with our X gig that includes your X phone lines and our connection back up at just $240 monthly. There is a one time installation for us to install that does just go on to the first month's bill. Please do not pay anything to the technician."" [Customer] ""Uh, what, what XX topic?"" [Agent] ""$100.00 "" [Customer] ""Anything we could do to waive it just for being we have been customers for a very, very, very long time."" [Agent] ""Yeah, we can definitely go ahead and waive that for you since you are getting set up with our X year price guarantee."" [Customer] ""Thank you."" [Agent] ""Of course, so then it would just be the $240 monthly then no install fee"" [Customer] ""Perfect, thank you, and I will get an email confirmation with all this too as well, right?"" [Agent] ""Yes, you are going to get a personal email from me, but then you are also going to get one from Optimum that is going to have all of this information broken down for you."" [Customer] ""Perfect thank you."" [Agent] ""Yeah, any other questions?"" [Customer] ""Um, to disconnect services, will I need to call to confirm or the disconnection should happen on the 30th, um. I mean I will triple check anyways just make sure we are not paying for like the services but uh."" [Agent] ""Of course."" [Customer] ""Should we anticipate the connection to uh this connection to occur on the 30th?"" [Agent] ""Yes, so you should expect the disconnection to happen on the 30th. I am going to get everything scheduled here in a bit, so you will get a confirmation email of install then you will also get a confirmation email for disconnect"" [Customer] ""Awesome, OK, my last question is. Let us say there is an issue with our backup like our um I mean do we just uh call and troubleshoot? I just want to triple check since we are you know paying like monthly and things like that. How I guess how um is it dependent on the location we are in like um I just want to confirm it is going to. Be worth it if that makes sense um."" [Agent] ""So are you meaning like just like technical support on it? I am sorry Eric."" [Customer] ""No, sorry, just like, uh, I, I guess between you and I, how, how, um, confident are you even in, um, like in this this backup solution for like basically I am trying to understand like if it is um an optimum provider hotspot right like it is not like a a Verizon, so just in case optimum's down if optimum's down in the area. Um, I guess what is the, um, hot spot working off of so I can ensure like it is not just they are both going to be down every time."" [Agent] ""Oh no, yeah, it is not based off Optimum what it is based off of, I believe it goes off of our T-Mobile, um, because that is who our cell phones are through is T-Mobile, and so that is just one of another device that we were able to get whenever we set up like our our contract with T-Mobile and it is really great for our customers."" [Customer] ""Uh Oh Excellent, yeah, and I, I love that, you know, um, you said T-Mobile because that is what I meant."" [Agent] ""I have not heard any issues with it. Um, everyone who keeps my email normally will report back and let me know how services are going, and I have not had any issues with it."" [Customer] ""That is why I said something like Verizon because that is kind of like a true disaster recovery if you know what I mean, just in case like one is down, another one, so thank you, that is all."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Um, is there basically I I know your reference, uh, we do like a temporary transfer"" [Agent] ""Yeah"" [Customer] ""So is there just before I get an email, is there an account number a reference number I can jot down, uh, just from our Confirmation of the conversation today."" [Agent] ""Oops Yes, so your new account number for your new location is going to be XX. XXX XXX. XXX-XX"" [Customer] ""Alright, and the pin is still XXXX, correct?"" [Agent] ""That is correct."" [Customer] ""Yeah? Awesome, is there a reference number just to like an order number or anything I can jot down as well if you do not mind?"" [Agent] ""Um, no, uh, if you want, you can have my operator ID."" [Customer] ""Yeah, that'd be great."" [Agent] ""OK, my operator ID is XXV as in Victor.""

[Customer] ""Yeah"" [Agent] ""No, I, I, I, I, I know we are XXX as I travel every day, um so let us see what we have"" [Customer] ""Especially from"" [Agent] ""Yeah, from Boulevard area, um."" [Customer] ""Yeah, from Bullet ID mhm."" [Agent] ""Let us see what we have as far as our deals go in this market. Just bear with me one moment. Counted we actually do have a discount running on our X gig. Um, it has your Wi Fi modem."" [Customer] ""OK Yeah Yeah."" [Agent] ""It if you have computers, maybe TVs, um, printers, things like that, connecting you do not have to worry about the bandwidth being overloaded and it failing. Um, it is a X year promotion there is no contracts involved, um, so you can make changes as you please Um, we will put you at XXX a month before taxes, um, about XXX, X, XXX after taxes, um. And if you wanted to include a phone line, um, it is just $10 more normally it is a $40 increase, but I can discount it down to $10 for the first one."" [Customer] ""OK. Well, who are you using for service provider on? You said phone or cell phones?"" [Agent] ""Um, so cell phones we use um T-Mobile towers. If you do sign up for at least one unlimited line, you do get $40 off the X gig plan."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So instead of being XXX, it will be $110. And with our cell phone plans you can get two lines for the price of $145."" [Customer] ""OK. OK. T-Mobile does not have very good service in some of our areas is my only hesitation."" [Agent] ""Well, there is, there is no contract, so if you feel like it is not the best, you can always cancel. Um, there is no contract with Optimum that promo, the $40 discount stays on the account as long as you have an unlimited line active on the the mobile side"" [Customer] ""Yeah OK. OK."" [Agent] ""How, how you read."" [Customer] ""Um, do you have anything? Do you have anything with a lower speed than one gig out of curiosity?"" [Agent] ""Uh, we do have our XXXMB, but it puts you at XXX a month."" [Customer] ""OK. Got it Is that same thing I do not know is that fiber or is that just high speed?"" [Agent] ""And Tyler it is not fiber ready as of yet, um, so it will just be coa so you will be 50/50 for the upload or um X gig over XX for the upload."" [Customer] ""Got it OK."" [Agent] ""How soon were you needing the service?"" [Customer] ""Um, Uh, I am wanting to verify that service can be provided the true cost of everything, so what I am doing right now is gathering quotes"" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Did the technician need to come out and verify that the install can be done and there is no additional fees because that is what I am wanting to just make sure of all of our costs for this before we move forward."" [Agent] ""Give me X 2nd. Because I will have to go in and do a special request order, but I can not do that if there is nothing pending um. Let me send you an email real fast that we have direct access to reaching out to me and then I will see if this will work."" [Customer] ""Hm"" [Agent] ""Brandon W at service. Master not pluralbo dogwood.com. It is going to come from Rachel on business."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Test And I heard something."" [Customer] ""OK, I got you."" [Agent] ""Alright, so the only way I can do a special request order for a tech to survey the property is if there is a pending work order for tech to install with our system, but you have direct access to me. So if the tech comes out beforehand, says, hey, we can not provide this , and so on, you say, Hey, I do not want this You can email me directly like Rachel, cancel it, and I can um, I can also waive the install fee of $100"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""You do not have to worry about a service fee if we do go ahead and go through with the install. You do not have to worry about paying that install fee. Uh, I can put this on schedule for the 30th for the tech to install if everything goes well."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""If you once again, if you need to cancel, just let me know and I can, I can go and do it for you. But then let me see what date we have available for."" [Customer] ""And that is uh"" [Agent] ""Um, the special request order."" [Customer] ""The 30th is next."" [Agent] ""Um, this Friday, next Friday."" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""This"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And then also"" [Customer] ""Um, mainly to change the date, but that'll give me enough time to look at it."" [Agent] ""That is fine. You, you have direct access to me now. Just be nice to me when you email me."" [Customer] ""OK, oK. Will do. I will. OK."" [Agent] ""I am almost done. Give me one more moment. I have to see what day we have for the special request was."" [Customer] ""Oh I guess just request that for."" [Agent] ""Yes, I have to see the dates and put your phone on the calls for them to, um, give you a heads up if they are in the area and they can not locate the property. Um, and actually with the discounts if you sign up for auto pay you do get a discount and it can bring it down to XXX."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""So instead of being XXX it will be XXX. So let us just reserve this for you."" [Customer] ""I know yeah. The"" [Agent] ""You sound like a robot. I did not hear any of that."" [Customer] ""I that we are getting rid of um."" [Agent] ""What was your question? I am sorry. Are you still there with me? I am going to try to call you on the other line, Mr. Brandon, give me one moment."""
Call206,"[Agent] ""Thank you for calling Optimum. Now offering Optimum Mobile. This is Sandra in the commercial sales department. How may I be of assistance?"" [Customer] ""Hi Sandra, how are you today?"" [Agent] ""Quite well, thank you for asking. How can I help you?"" [Customer] ""Hi, I am trying to, I am moving into a new location I am trying to set up my internet service, so I would like to know if you guys cover that area and if so, if we can proceed with opening an account and settingup service"" [Agent] ""I would be happy to let us take a look. Can I kindly have the address where you are looking to get service?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, so I am going to give you the address. There is several buildings in there, so I am not sure if it is going to come up under this one, but can we check this one on X Ford Avenue, that is X S O R D Avenue in Milltown, M I L L T O W N, New Jersey XXXXX."" [Agent] ""Thank you and this is for your business just to confirm."" [Customer] ""Yes, this is"" [Agent] ""OK, perfect. May I have your name so I can address you properly, please?"" [Customer] ""Sure, my name is Anisa, A N I S A H."" [Agent] ""Uh, I am sorry, A N I."" [Customer] ""S A H"" [Agent] ""Perfect thank you and in case we happen to get disconnected, I have you on a XXX-XXX-XXXX. OK, so let us take a look."" [Customer] ""Yes, that is correct."" [Agent] ""Thank you. In case we get disconnected, I will gladly give you a ring back. So let us take a look. Is there a particular suite number within X or X specifically your location?"" [Customer] ""Thank you So, um, I do not really know what it is going to show up as. Um, it could be X Ford Avenue or it could maybe show up under XXX Ford Avenue. I am not sure which one cause like the buildings are all connected, so it is a little confusing there. I am not sure when you search it, when you, if you see something under X Ford Avenue or if not, then I will check the XXX Ford Avenue."" [Agent] ""Hm, interesting. What does it say on your lease just out of curiosity."" [Customer] ""Yeah, because it is like So the lease, the lease does say X Ford Avenue."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""But there is like several buildings there and then my office is like around the building and then that shows a different number as well."" [Agent] ""What does that show?"" [Customer] ""So Um, so the office shows 1:30."" [Agent] ""Have you spoken to the people that do like the electricity and stuff? What they, what did they find you under?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, so the, so the electricity, um, is going to be under XX Avenue."" [Agent] ""OK, so I would suggest that we do the same because for us I pulled up both addresses."" [Customer] ""So here is my next question with that. The thing is. So X Ford Avenue is the ware like my warehousing my office portion is around the corner at XXX Ford Avenue Not like around the building, so. I do not know necessarily. Do you do you pull up XXXX."" [Agent] ""You tell me. Yep, I pull up 1:30 as well."" [Customer] ""You pull up XXX Avenue as well?"" [Agent] ""As well, yes, ma'am."" [Customer] ""You do pull up both of them."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Do you show any internet service currently at any of them?"" [Agent] ""There was a DMS. I was just about to say we had a DNS distributors, a seeker relocation."" [Customer] ""So I do not know. What would be the safest because I need this I would need the internet services in both locations so like the office location, you know, we will have all the computers and everything and then in the warehouse location, you know, I have a camera system I will have a computer there as well so Does that mean I would have to put the internet in both places?"" [Agent] ""That could be very likely because think of like if you are in an apartment, let us say you in an apartment building, let us say you live in apartment XXX. And then, you know, your mom lives in the same building she lives right down the hall in XXX"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""You you would have two accounts, one for XXX and one for XXX. What I can do is get you started with the main one at 1:30. And then you see how far the internet reaches."" [Customer] ""Hm. OK, maybe we can do that, um, maybe that makes sense."" [Agent] ""Because it also has to do, cause it, it, it also has to do with how big your location is. You are speaking to me as warehouses, warehouses tend to be rather large in size, so without actually having the connection there, it would not be fair of me to say, oh no."" [Customer] ""Yeah. It is Mhm."" [Agent] ""Oh it definitely will not. Oh yeah, sure, it absolutely will, you know what I am saying?"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""because um until it is it is installed, there is no factual way of knowing how far it is going to reach I do not want to, you know what I am saying It is, it would be deceiving of me to be like, yeah, absolutely."" [Customer] ""Got you, makes sense."" [Agent] ""You know what I am saying? Or no, absolutely not, you know, so if you want I can get you started because you are telling me that the sign on the door says 1:30 and we have a separate 1:30 that is been active until recently."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""I would suggest that we do the 1:30."" [Customer] ""Sure Mhm."" [Agent] ""I feel comfortable because it says here rear it actually says back, you know, so it that that that kind of describes the location where you are going. Let me go ahead and start setting that up for you and then we will see how quick."" [Customer] ""Hm Can I put you on hold for one second? Do you mind send me a quick phone call to my um. Uh, the person that I work with, to, um, see what they say."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""And do that."" [Agent] ""Yeah, of course, of course, if we get disconnected, I will gladly give you a ring back I will hold for you"" [Customer] ""Alright thank you Thank you so much."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Hello?"" [Agent] ""Yes, I am right here."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK, so I think I am going to put it on the like you are suggesting on one of the buildings, but if I need, if I do put only one building and then I need to add it to another building, will it be like an easy thing to just go ahead and add the services I already like have one now, or will it be like a whole process as well?"" [Agent] ""It would be the same if this one's this one's not going to be hard at all because you already basically you are going to be in communication with me. I will give you my email address at the end of the conversation, so we will just go ahead and repeat the process."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Technician goes out there we go ahead and set you up for service, so no, we are going to go ahead and keep this to as minimal stress as possible"" [Customer] ""OK. OK.

[Customer] ""OK OK, OK, alright, yeah, I have X, the X accounts so I know I am going to put on the other one and maybe be easier in case we have any issues because my other partner travels a lot so he is not always there"" [Agent] ""You tell me.""

[Agent] ""How many employees do you have?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, we run a trucking and warehousing business. Um, so we basically, um, you know, a whole freight, a whole freight from like containers from overseas and we ship it to like local stores and, um, you know, customers come in and they pick up for out of state orders pretty much."" [Agent] ""Nice. OK, good stuff. So how, how big is your team?"" [Customer] ""Um, so, what, what, what I have, I am just going to let you know what I have right now, maybe that will make it easier."" [Agent] ""Sure, go right ahead."" [Customer] ""So right now with what I have in my current location with Verizon, they told me I have XXX and the. Does that make any sense?"" [Agent] ""Mhm. It does to me, yes."" [Customer] ""So that is what, yeah, so that is basically what the service that I have right now because we have about um let us see XXXX, we will probably have about about X computers."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""And then aside from the computers, I do have the camera system you know we have quite a few cameras"" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""I do not know exactly how much um we have a minimum of at least XX cameras I believe."" [Agent] ""OK, so that makes sense. OK, perfect, thank you. Talk to me about phone service."" [Customer] ""So the, the, I do not necessarily need phone service. um, you kind of tell me what you think. So I basically have one of those like voice over services where you just once you have internet you can just connect your phone so that way your phone number like always stays the same"" [Agent] ""OK, you have an over the top service, got you."" [Customer] ""So that Yeah, so I actually have that for the phone, so I do not think that we need to set up a phone unless for some reason like it has to come with the phone. I do not know I do not necessarily"" [Agent] ""Yeah, no, I was asking more in the sense of how many additional lines you need because it does come with the phone, um, with the double play promotion because it gives you a deeper discount on the Internet service to help offset the pricing structure of the service."" [Customer] ""Mhm Yeah."" [Agent] ""So that, you know, if you will have one as a backup, so definitely I was just it was more. Me finding out if you needed additional phone numbers for the rest of the office kind of thing."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So with the one line, um, do you have more so with what they have, you are good to go and then you will have us as a backup just in case you need it for a fax or something like that that'll already be there."" [Customer] ""No, yeah, no."" [Agent] ""Can you tell me how long the lease for this location is?"" [Customer] ""OK, oK, that works. So as of right now it is for X years."" [Agent] ""OK perfect thank you um and you are hoping that you you fit well and that you know you will be able to extend it to hopefully more time is that correct?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, so that, yeah, that is what we are hoping. He did not want to give us a longer than X year lease because, you know, everyone was pricing and you know how that goes. So we are hoping that once we get in there we start paying our rent on time, he automatically gives us the option to at least extend it for an additional X to X."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Yeah because ideally we would like to initially extend it for that long, but we are going to go in there and start paying our rent and then hopefully in like a XXX months we can approach them and say hey, just extend us from now because we do not want like an issue at the end of a X year lease, you know."" [Agent] ""Perfect. Perfect. OK, that is beautiful. That is a beautiful, beautiful thing. Alrighty then, dear, so let us go ahead and take a look. I am just putting some of the things together for you. So for the service that you have with Verizon, do you, um, tell me what your monthly rate was with them just so I know, um, you know what I."" [Customer] ""Yeah, so I pay um. Yeah, I, it is actually not that bad. Um, I, so my bill every month is about $100 like $101 something, XXX change."" [Agent] ""Got you. Alright, no problem then. So let me go ahead and work as much as my magic as I can possibly and let us go ahead and see how quickly also we can get you installed. When are you moving in or when are you hoping to have services up and running at the location?"" [Customer] ""So So we have already started to move in, so I would like to have this up like as soon as possible because they are already installing the new the cameras, but it would not be able to work without the internet."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""So, um, you know, like if we."" [Agent] ""Uh, that, that makes sense."" [Customer] ""Yeah, we can put like a rush on it like basically as soon as possible because I, I mean I am still in my old location which is fine for my office purposes, but we already started to transfer freight through the cameras, you know, we are going to, we want to like set up the offices hopefully over the weekend so it is pretty much ASAP as soon as you can get me service, that is kind of what I need."" [Agent] ""No worries. There is no Mhm. Not a problem. So as far as the services are concerned, based on the fact and is this space a little bit bigger than the previous space"" [Customer] ""Yeah. No, it is actually smaller, to be honest."" [Agent] ""Nice. OK, perfect."" [Customer] ""Well, the office, OK, so the office is smaller, but the warehouse is bigger, so I do not know if that makes a difference. I do not know like as far as the internet. I, I, I do not know what makes a difference, but that is kind of about it."" [Agent] ""OK, so it makes a difference in the sense of uh what we are trying to obtain. So listen, I, I, I have worked with the company for quite a long time, and at the end of the day, um, it, it comes out in the fact that if you try to do right by the customer up front you will have a longer relationship with them kind of like what you are trying to do with your landlord."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Sure Right Right"" [Agent] ""You want to go ahead and start paying your bill on time. You want to go ahead and make sure that you can extend your lease and and just be. Comfortable because there is a lot of costs that they are involved with moving, you know what I am saying? So if you do not have to do it frequently, that is, that is a good thing."" [Customer] ""Right Yeah."" [Agent] ""So that is what I want to go ahead and do if I can go ahead and get you the level of service that you need that could potentially cover most of your area."" [Customer] ""Right. Mhm"" [Agent] ""And get you up and running with the services that you need so you do not have to go ahead and set up a second um internet service."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""Well, then that is great. You know what I am saying?"" [Customer] ""Right Oh, yeah, I was great, mhm."" [Agent] ""If it happens to be that because of this location, the office, I understand, is a little bit smaller, but the warehouse is bigger where it happens to be that you may need an additional modem for that space, at least, you know, you, you."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Already are aware of the situation and the reasoning behind it and you know we can work with that can be worked out as well um so what I would suggest as far as the services are concerned now Optimum can provide you a X year promotion."" [Customer] ""Right. Right. Right. OK Mhm."" [Agent] ""I can provide you a X year promotion. Your goal is to be here long term. Your goal is not to be here just for a little bit so I am going to go ahead and give you the pricing structure for the X year promotion, um, so that is going to go ahead and mean that you have no contract no cancellation charges You can cancel at any time."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So let us say that for any reason you are moving because you won the lottery, you are retiring, whatever the case may be in X years, you can just return the equipment and you will be fine."" [Customer] ""OK. Right. Mhm."" [Agent] ""There is no cancellation charges. But if you happen to extend your stay, then you can keep your pricing the same and like have that X-year promotion where you know everything's going to stay on a budget."" [Customer] ""OK, oK. Uh"" [Agent] ""This is also going to be almost X times faster than what you currently have."" [Customer] ""OK, that works."" [Agent] ""So right now you are about at XXX and change."" [Customer] ""OK, that sounds great."" [Agent] ""So right now you are about XXX and change your new monthly rate, including a dial tone, your modem, your router, a gig speed of service, X gig is the equivalent of XXXX megs. So you know when you told me earlier that it was XXX megs, is it going to be XXXX megs, so it is almost X times faster than what you currently have."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK"" [Agent] ""It is basically going to be XXX/XX on the upload. Um, it includes the dial tone, so if you need to connect the fax or anything like that, that'll be there."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""The monthly rate is $180 and the estimated taxes are $5.94. We also go ahead and include the equipment in there so you do not have to go ahead and purchase a modem or a router. There is no charge for it for the duration of the promo. If for any reason something happens to the modem, you do not have to replace it. We go out there and replace it. Included is your premier technical support so that you can have any assistance that you may need with networking your devices over the phone. You can give us a call we will assist and you will also have an additional piece of equipment which is a failover service."" [Customer] ""For Oh that is"" [Agent] ""So if for any reason, let us say the main internet is down, it automatically switches over your six main devices to that failover service and it connects to LTE so you will not be down. So you know how sometimes technology happens there is just. Storm, the main internet service goes down, you, you know, you are, you are waiting, you know, a few hours or sometimes maybe a day if depending on, you know, natural disasters, whatever the case may be, you know, for us to go out there and fix the line or just in general because it can happen to anybody, you will have that LTE back up so it automatically switches whether it is your cameras, whether it is your credit card terminal, your main computer book appointments, whatever it is, it connects your main computers to the to that device."" [Customer] ""Yeah, right. Sure Right."" [Agent] ""And I can give you an appointment tomorrow."" [Customer] ""OK, so I"" [Agent] ""And I can give you an appointment tomorrow."" [Customer] ""OK, um, this all sounds great. The only question that I have is."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""If the service ends up not being. Far enough to get over like to the warehouse portion, that means I would have to be setting up a separate internet, so."" [Agent] ""Yes, and then at that point we can reconsider what services you need for that one because it is not going to be running all your computers and everything like that so you may, um, decide to you may you may decide not to include."" [Customer] ""Um, Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, the dial tone in that you may decide not to go ahead and do the gig. You may decide to go with a different level at that point you know what I am saying So that, so you go ahead and make those modifications."" [Customer] ""OK, yeah."" [Agent] ""It does not mean that you have to go with XXX times you know what I am Thing right now with this one, the goal is it is a longer period of promotion. It is a X year promo. It is the top speed that we have which is the gig speed of service, which is, um, industry standard, and, um, it includes your modem, your router, permit technical support, your connection fail over service the dial tone When you and I speak, um, regarding the second one, we will see what we can do towards, um, you know, different levels because if you just need it for the cameras, you may not necessarily want to get, you may want something, you know, a little bit different at that location. So right now the goal is to have this account only this account"" [Customer] ""Yeah, I"" [Agent] ""When the technician goes out there tomorrow you can speak to him towards what the goal is so that he advises you where to install the modem like where is the highest concentration of devices going to be, where's the mainframe for the camera"" [Customer] ""Mhm. Mhm. Mhm."" [Agent] ""Maybe he is going to suggest OK, put the uh put the mainframe for the camera here so that it feeds off of. This device and then the cameras can go ahead and connect directly there, you know what I am saying that is, that is uh that is a that is something for you to discuss on a little side note over here if you decide to do auto pay and paperless, it will go down an additional $5 because you get $5 discount for auto pay and paperless."" [Customer] ""Right. OK."" [Agent] ""OK, I am going to go ahead and ask you to choose a X digit."" [Customer] ""That is fine."" [Agent] ""I am going to ask you to choose a X digit access code for your account. What four digits would you like that to be?"" [Customer] ""OK. Um, we will do XXXX I also just have one more question"" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Sorry, in the event that um."" [Agent] ""Sure, no, no, no."" [Customer] ""Basically just in the event that I do have to take an additional internet service, let us say I wanted to lower the speed or lower what I have right now with what we are taking right now for a, you know, a cheaper like rate, is that, will that be a possibility or will I not be able to do that?"" [Agent] ""Absolutely you can because there is no contract or cancellation fees."" [Customer] ""OK, so that OK, so then we are good."" [Agent] ""You go ahead and be able to speak to the customer care department and they will be able to go ahead and modify it with you. They will advise what can be done, you know, what changes and things of this sort , you know, financially what would work out best for you"" [Customer] ""And OK Yeah, that is fine because I am OK with paying as long as it covers everything. I am fine with the XXX, XXX. I can work with that as long as it is going to cover the whole thing. It is just that if I have to do a second one, then I would want to lower this one just to make the bill, like, you know, I do not have like a double bill or whatever the case may be."" [Agent] ""Understood. And there is also other things that you can consider like uh I myself have been, um, have a basement in my home. And what I did was that, uh, and this is just me speaking as a person, no longer a sales rep, you know, just kind of giving, uh what I did was that I went to Best Buy and I bought an Eros mesh router, E E R O I think that is what it is called, so it is there is one connected at the top of my uh um right next to my modem and then there is another one connected uh at the bottom in the basement."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Right. Yeah that Mhm. Mhm."" [Agent] ""So what it does is that it duplicates the signal."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""It basically it is a mesh router, so it. Enhances it downstairs because my basement TV used to buffer a lot so I was like, alright, so that is something that you can speak with your IT guy and see if that would help because if you purchase a mesh router then that is a one time investment and you know that could go ahead and feed your cameras as well."" [Customer] ""Right. That."" [Agent] ""So there is always uh additional things that you can do before you have to pull the trigger on an additional one."" [Customer] ""Yeah. OK."" [Agent] ""Did you want an X to XX or an XX to X please?"" [Customer] ""OK, that is fines I am sorry, what was that?"" [Agent] ""X to XX or XX to X."" [Customer] ""Oh, the time frame? What was it? or what was that? Um, You said I am sorry, XX to X was the other time?"" [Agent] ""X to XX or XX to X."" [Customer] ""Let us do um XX to X to be on the safe side."" [Agent] ""OK, so XX to X and they are going to call you on that XXXX before they get there to confirm that they are on their way, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Now, are you, are you?"" [Customer] ""That is perfect I will make sure that someone is sent"" [Agent] ""Perfect, are you driving by any chance?"" [Customer] ""I am, I am I am"" [Agent] ""God forbid we do all this multitasking."" [Customer] ""Yeah, because like I know that this whole whole thing is going to take me a while and to be honest, I have a long drive to get into the office because I live in New York and the office is in New Jersey, so I have a long ride, so I am like, listen, instead of being in the office and taking up the time trying to figure out this internet thing, I am just going to do it on my drive because, you know, got to get it somehow."" [Agent] ""Mhm. No, that is OK. I will keep you company. It is all good. No worries. No worries at all."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah."" [Agent] ""Alrighty then, so let us go ahead and take a look here next."" [Customer] ""And"" [Agent] ""OK, so as far as the services are concerned, let me go ahead and just recap the order. Normally I would ask you to write down the account number. I want you to keep your hands on the wheel, please. So."" [Customer] ""OK. I appreciate that."" [Agent] ""You know, just, you know, keep in mind that the system should go ahead and send you an email confirmation, um, within X to X hours, so no worries, and I am also going to go ahead and send you a test email from myself so that, um, you know, if, if you do end up needing any additional services you end up needing to speak to me um regarding"" [Customer] ""OK. OK. OK."" [Agent] ""Um, mobile service or anything like that, at least you already have me as a contact person, OK? I will be happy to go ahead and extend it."" [Customer] ""That is perfect. I really appreciate that."" [Agent] ""Yeah, no problem. Alright then, so let me go ahead and just make sure we are all on the same page. Just going to recap the order. And I am going to include the phone number for technical support in the email that I sent you. Remember my email is separate from the email confirmation that you are going to get from the company me this is just me saying, hey, how are you?"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""You know, if you need me, let me know kind of situation they send you all the, you know, the, the exact email with everything so."" [Customer] ""OK. Perfect. OK."" [Agent] ""Um, I am going to put the phone number for technical support."" [Customer] ""OK, that is Mhm."" [Agent] ""Once you are installed, call technical support and have them help you create an online web portal because then at that point you will have all your devices."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""Um, my apologies, access to all your services on the web portal."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""If you ever want to set up autopay and paperless, you can do it at that point as well."" [Customer] ""OK. Uh OK."" [Agent] ""You just want to go ahead and have full access to your. Not on the web portal, OK, so let us take a look. So your installation will be a one-time charge that gets filled out at $100."" [Customer] ""OK, sounds good."" [Agent] ""Your monthly rate will be $180 your taxes are going to be $5.94 estimated"" [Customer] ""OK. Mhm."" [Agent] ""This is going to include your gig speed of service with your premier technical support of the XX, your modem, your router, your phone number your connection fail over at the XX no contracts, no cancellation charges on a X year promotion."" [Customer] ""OK Yes, I agree."" [Agent] ""And please note that the terms and conditions which contain binding arbitrary provisions are available at assurance.com/optimum terms and will be sent to you via email. By enrolling, you agree to these important details and the terms and conditions and just kindly confirm that you would like to enroll in the premier technical support. I just need a verbal confirmation from you. Perfect, thank you. Um, your access code is XXXX. I hope it is a significant number. You can remember it in the future."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""If you ever forget it, you can when you log into your username and password, you could always reset it there. For the record, I will just go ahead and state your."" [Customer] ""OK, no, it is fine we can talk everything."" [Agent] ""Perfect. For the record, I am just going to go ahead and state the account number for the call, but I will include it in the email that I am going to send you myself."" [Customer] ""OK OK perfect."" [Agent] ""It is going to be XXXXX-XXXXXX-XX. I know the lotto numbers are somewhere in there. I do not know the sequence, but somewhere within that are the lotto numbers, so feel free just remember where I am."" [Customer] ""We are going to try out."" [Agent] ""Optimum, um, um, my name is Sandra. I am the only in the commercial sales department. But at this point."" [Customer] ""Definitely got it. I will for you."" [Agent] ""So if um at this point your services are good to go, my only other question is what are you doing for mobile service if you do not mind me asking please?"" [Customer] ""Um, well, I have for my mobile service I have, um, Verizon"" [Agent] ""OK, so Optimum can offer you Optimum Mobile, which is our cellular service. We run off of T-Mobile towers um we can do up to XX lines on a mobile account"" [Customer] ""Right"" [Agent] ""I can go ahead even if just to keep it simple. Optimum does not have any contracts or or cancellation charges on a mobile service either. If you have a phone that you can go ahead and bring over, we would just need an IMEI number you could get an unlimited line which is $47 If you have that unlimited line which includes unlimited talk, text, and data with XX gigs of premium data, you get $40 off on your internet service because we have a multi-product discount that would be applicable."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So literally you can get a business cell phone for $7."" [Customer] ""OK, um, that would have to be. Right"" [Agent] ""Yeah, you can keep, yeah you can keep the same phone number if you would like as far as services are concerned remember this is just this is a cell phone you could use your personal cell phone and bring it over to the business account you can add a business cell phone to the company, you know, it depends it is just making it an easy way to save money if you do not have a business cell phone already you can separate church and state and"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Do it at a very affordable charge because you know how sometimes you start up a business and it is really hard because because you started using your cell phone and then it is just everything your cell phone rings at all times you can do separation of church and state basically $7."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah."" [Agent] ""It is literally $45 for the cell phone line, $2 in taxes, so that is why I call it what it is. It is X. $7 but you do get $40 additional on the internet service off so that $180 goes down to $140 if you are expecting to pay the X, you know, $180 plus the taxes $6 now it is just $7 difference."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Mhm."" [Agent] ""It does not matter where the money is coming from because it is coming from the same pocket, even though it is two different accounts, one for the mobile account, one for the internet, you are still being able to go ahead and um."" [Customer] ""Right. Mhm."" [Agent] ""You know, you are still able to go ahead and get that um very deep discount and get you a business so. So you can bring over the one that you have right now I am sure you are thinking you are thinking about the math of how much you are paying for your Verizon line and hopefully that accounts to some savings if you want the benefit of having a mobile line"" [Customer] ""OK"" [Agent] ""$7 is not too much to invest."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Any way you look at it it is not a bad thing."" [Customer] ""OK, um, I am trying to think, but if I were to just. Um, Cause I have an account. I also have a T-Mobile account that I will be closing soon, but not yet. I am thinking maybe I could transfer over one of those lines. But um I can not do it now. Like this is something we would have to do like right now?"" [Agent] ""No, because you are going to have me and right now we have this ongoing for the services. I am a commission based sales representative."" [Customer] ""OK, so that Mhm Oh, definitely."" [Agent] ""I would just go ahead and ask that if you do decide to do it, hit me up instead of just calling back in and speaking to somebody else, just email me I will be happy to assist"" [Customer] ""Oh no, I would, I would, I would definitely call, yeah, for sure, because I do have like besides Verizon, I have a T-Mobile account but I will be closing, um, two of those phone numbers. I am, I will be removing from the account like completely, but the third number I was going to transfer it to my Verizon line but maybe I can just transfer it to the optimum and then that way we can get that whole discount thing that is going on right now."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Absolutely. So if you are already using T-Mobile towers, so you know the quality of the service, that is #X."" [Customer] ""So, OK, yeah."" [Agent] ""#X. If you add it onto your Verizon line, which is comfortable because you do not have to open up a new account, but you are not going to be paying $7 for it."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""You know what I am saying? You are going to be paying whatever your charges are for Verizon, whether it is $30.40 dollars, $50 you know, for that line."" [Customer] ""Right, exactly."" [Agent] ""With us we do have that edge that you do get that multi-product discount you would be getting, you know, automatic bill payment for the $47 and then on this one when you add it on, it will give you that additional $40 discount within X to within usually X to X billing cycles you start getting that additional discount on it so it does help because you do not sacrifice online."" [Customer] ""Yeah. The So it would be, so would be, would it be like a Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""I am sorry, go right ahead and listen."" [Customer] ""So would it be like, so would it be, so would it be a separate bill that I am, I would be getting for the phone? Like how, how would it work?"" [Agent] ""Yes, you have uh the cellular service is a separate account number but you have that on auto pay because the cell phone has to be auto pay and then you can go ahead and then you will have that separate fixed services XX account and one payment is for the cellular service, the other one is for the fixed service which we are installing tomorrow."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Right, that is fine. OK. Mhm. OK, so then, so the way it would work is the self service bill would basically be $47 and then the bill that we are doing for the business would then essentially be $140 something."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Correct, right now it is going to be basically XXX, it would then be XXX."" [Customer] ""The house and work OK. OK, so that would be XXX and then the cell phone would be the XXX or whatever it is."" [Agent] ""Exactly, and if you add things up."" [Customer] ""OK, yeah, so I am definitely going to take you up on that offer."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""I am definitely going to take up an offer. I am planning to close. Do you know how long this promotion is going on for? Maybe I can probably just work on transferring one line out for now."" [Agent] ""I mean I can definitely get that started for you at this time if you have the IMEI number on the phone number that you want to use um."" [Customer] ""No, I, I have to, yeah, no, I can not do it right now. I probably have to call you back in a little bit, like, not maybe like, you know, a little week or folks that have to speak to the, the people, but I am just trying to think to myself that maybe because I am planning to cancel the other, um, bill at the end of."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Well, it was supposed to be the end of this month, but I think I have to do it at the end of June, but um, I possibly can next month."" [Agent] ""Yeah, but that does not stop you from pulling the phone number prior because before you cancel it, the phone number, the phone number would have already had to have been out before you cancel it because you, if you cancel it, we can not put out the number."" [Customer] ""XX on the number, yeah, I am thinking. Yeah, correct, so."" [Agent] ""Um, in the"" [Customer] ""Yeah, I am thinking next month like the beginning of the month, I can maybe transfer it."" [Agent] ""OK. Um, one thing to go and consider is the IMEI depending on the phone that you have, how new it is a lot of phones"" [Customer] ""And then, yeah, so. Mhm. Mhm."" [Agent] ""Are, are you an Apple or are you a Samsung?"" [Customer] ""Mhm Yes, it, it would be an Apple, it would be an Apple phone, I think it would probably be like a XX or XX."" [Agent] ""OK, so. So the reason why I am saying is that if you call and and those do have I am um uh eMs basically what you would do is that you can go ahead and have two services."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""On that same phone because you have one eSIM and then you have a second eSIM, and they can work with different carriers. Like if you only want to carry around one phone, it will just say, you can, you know, if you look at your settings, you go to about, you know, you know, general, you know, about all the way at the bottom, you will see that you have your carrier locked in to your Verizon then you have a 2nd SIM number"" [Customer] ""Right"" [Agent] ""You have a second IMEI number at the bottom. That you can go ahead and use as a second carrier we could go ahead and send you an eSI to that so you do not even have to carry around two phones. You could just go ahead and. Carry one phone. That is, that is another option if you do not have a second phone you do not want to buy an additional device, because the point is to go ahead and save money here It is not to go ahead and make this more expensive than it needs to be."" [Customer] ""Yeah, so, but would I be able to just, um, like let us say I just want to keep whatever phone line, whatever it is that I have, like I can just transfer over the number I am going to have to have a new number"" [Agent] ""Mhm. You can No, no, no, the, the, you can port that phone number and whatever phone it is attached to. You can go ahead and bring that phone over as a bring your own device."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""As long as it is paid off and unlocked, we can go ahead and bring both port the number and the device."" [Customer] ""OK, yeah."" [Agent] ""Sometimes people want to consolidate, so I was saying if you wanted to consolidate and not carry two phones, you can do that. Sometimes it is, you know, it is again, it is just a personal preference."" [Customer] ""Yeah Yeah, but there was just"" [Agent] ""Um, your appointment is in the system, you are.

[Customer] ""If that is possible, um, OK, yeah, so, OK, in regards to the credit card machine, that could be a maybe, I want to say maybe on that, um, and then you asked about if customers come um, what was the question about the customers again"" [Agent] ""OK. Are they, are they calling?"" [Customer] ""I forgot."" [Agent] ""Are they going on social media? Are they walking in or how are they getting in contact with you?"" [Customer] ""So they will call me on my cell phone."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""I will be using a lot on my cell phone. Um, when they make a purchase online cause these auctions are done, everything, the e-commerce, everything they buy, it is furniture, decorative stuff, it is going to be online either through an auction house, so they will buy in the comfort of their home or their own business, you know, because they might be interior designers, um, and then they contact me to pick up the call like either email, text, or call. So they will come they will contact me."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""I will be on my phone quite a bit and on the computer. I have a land, a stationary computer, um, like a desktop."" [Agent] ""OK"" [Customer] ""Um, so that is what I need to I, I need Wi Fi the most for for my computer and my phone, which, and then an iPad that, you know, so those three, those are the most important thing, my phone, my iPad, and my computer, my desktop."" [Agent] ""OK perfect."" [Customer] ""And then customers that come pick up, they might want to use the Wi Fi just because when they pick up they want to reassured that this is the item that they are picking up, you know, and the, the drivers that pick up, you know, they need to like get on the Wi Fi, go on the internet."" [Agent] ""That makes sense."" [Customer] ""And maybe contact their their. The the buyer Um, and just coordinate that with, you know, make sure that they are picking up the right item , you know"" [Agent] ""That makes sense. OK, yes, yes, it does."" [Customer] ""Does that make sense? Yeah."" [Agent] ""So we do have a promotion going on right now, um we actually have a few"" [Customer] ""Thank you."" [Agent] ""Um, that includes mobile or just includes or without mobile, but I want to quote this one without mobile, um, first, uh, we, we have our one gig special, so if you have your iPad, your, your phone, your cell phones, your, your computer, cameras in the future, your customers or drivers connecting, um, throughout the day, this will not overload your bandwidth, so it will not lag, it will not buffer, um, it will not drop because it is being overloaded."" [Customer] ""OK. Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, it is a Wi Fi connection so you can connect to it wirelessly or if you want to connect to it hardwired with your computer, you can. Um, it is a X year promotion there is absolutely no contracts It does feature shooting on for your devices that connect. It gives you a backup connection in that as well that way if we ever perform maintenance in the area you have an outage, you do not have to worry about your internet going down"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""It will automatically boot up to a wireless connection so you have that stable connection for your service. Um, and then it does also give you a dedicated voice line as a backup for your customers, um, just in case there is ever any issues with your phone, your cell phone I know there is a really big thing like X years ago where the cell phone service went down"" [Customer] ""Oh nice. Oh."" [Agent] ""You do not have to worry about that. I do not know if you are aware of that, um, AT&T, Verizon, they had issues with their cell phone service for like a full day, um, so I will give you a landline number just in case it is a backup."" [Customer] ""Oh, I think."" [Agent] ""You remember that? Yeah."" [Customer] ""Yes, yes, I do remember that."" [Agent] ""So this, this promotion used to be like $200 but we made changes and we brought it back uh down for our customers to just $155 if you sign up for autopay it is $150 and it is a X year promotion. I think I said that."" [Customer] ""OK XXX, OK."" [Agent] ""Mm"" [Customer] ""OK, so, so it includes a landline?"" [Agent] ""It does if you do not want to include the landline, it is just $10 less for the discounts I applied, so bring it down to $145 or $140 depending on the auto pay option."" [Customer] ""OK, I am going to, you know, um with, with. Thank you, Rachel. Um, I am going to have to converse with my, my, um, my boss, OK?"" [Agent] ""No, you are So it is not a contract, uh so you can make changes as you please"" [Customer] ""So it is a X year promotion, so you have, when you sign a contract, it is for X years, you are committed for X years, correct?"" [Agent] ""We are pretty much month to month with the promotion itself will last that long. That is how long it is locked in for. Um, we do have, we do have a second promotion, um, that can save you a tad bit of money depending on what you are paying for cell phone service."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK."" [Agent] ""If you have mobile and were to switch over, you can save $40 off your internet we have X months, um, for $45 so I am going to talk, text and data"" [Customer] ""Uh huh."" [Agent] ""And X gigabytes of mobile hotspot for two lines for just $45. So essentially just $5 a month for cell phone service, um, if you need to discuss this with your."" [Customer] ""Wait, so is"" [Agent] ""Oh good."" [Customer] ""So instead of um Are you saying instead of um. Having uh unlimited Wi Fi like that, we just have the landline it is just Wi Fi."" [Agent] ""No, no, no No, ma'am, um, so if you have mobile, no, you are fine, you are fine."" [Customer] ""I am sorry."" [Agent] ""I talk fast too, um, so if you have mobile currently you were to switch over to Optimum, you can get unlimited talk, text, and data and um hotspot for $45 but also on top of that you get $40 off your internet So instead of it being $145 it will be $105 if you explore that option."" [Customer] ""Which is if I have optimum already, is that what you are saying?"" [Agent] ""Um, no, who do you have currently for your cell phone service?"" [Customer] ""I think we have frontier what I have at home, correct?"" [Agent] ""Um, just like your personal usage, um, do you use like T-Mobile, um, or who is your carrier?"" [Customer] ""I think, I think my carrier is sent here."" [Agent] ""Frontier, um, do you know how much you are paying the frontier for the mobile service?"" [Customer] ""I think like $45 I want to say."" [Agent] ""So it will be the, it will be the same price essentially, but you can get two lines for that same price, but then you also get $40 off the internet. So you will be saving money."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK."" [Agent] ""Mhm"" [Customer] ""So this is another this is another um"" [Agent] ""Service"" [Customer] ""What, so this is another option."" [Agent] ""Yes."" [Customer] ""So is this more cost effective?"" [Agent] ""Um, for you, I mean if you are paying $45 currently then you would not see a huge, um, boost in the price for your mobile, but you will see a large discount on the internet service just by switching, um, so instead of it being like $145 a month it will drop it down to $105 or $100 depending on if you sign up for autopay plus your cell phone service."" [Customer] ""Oh, so the, this is a, uh, this option is, it is separate, right? Cell phone service and internet service is separate, is that what you are saying?"" [Agent] ""Yes, yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am."" [Customer] ""XX, OK. And how much is that, would that be? Like how much is it for the internet? XXX you said?"" [Agent] ""Um, with the cell phone option it is XXX and then your cell phone service would just be XX, so essentially XXX for internet and cell phone service."" [Customer] ""So it is the same as the other one."" [Agent] ""Um,"" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""Well, if you"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah."" [Agent] ""I do not want to confuse you."" [Customer] ""The other one"" [Agent] ""So if you um keep Frontier, if you are paying $45 and if you go with our internet, it is $140 so $185 XXX dollars."" [Customer] ""Yeah, so."" [Agent] ""If you were to switch your cell phone service over on top of getting the internet, you are saving $40 so it will be $145 XXX dollars roughly."" [Customer] ""Oh, I see what you are saying. OK, OK, so I am sorry, so you are saying that because I, I have Frontier, you give me another option where I would get Optimum, the, the first plan if I switch over, that you are going to give me my private line at a discount, is that what you are saying"" [Agent] ""No, you are fine. Mhm. Yes, ma'am. Yes ma'am."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK, so, so instead of using frontier I would be going to Optimum at home as well, right?"" [Agent] ""Optimum, um, cell phone service, yes ma'am."" [Customer] ""At home, at home, not for business."" [Agent] ""Um, you can use it for business or you can use it for personal use."" [Customer] ""Correct."" [Agent] ""But since you, since you, since you use your, your cell phone service mainly for like business, um, that is why I, I uh push that promotion because you use it all the time."" [Customer] ""Oh."" [Agent] ""So, um, you have that option to utilize a business account for mobile service as well, um if you have more than one line we have multi-line savings and discounts, but if you just want to do the one line"" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""Total you will be paying is XXX a month for internet and cell phone service."" [Customer] ""OK, and then, and then, and then if I just want um without landline it would be XXX and then or XXX correct?"" [Agent] ""Yes ma'am, yes ma'am."" [Customer] ""OK, and but if I want to do the other promotion which is. Get a, get a business internet and cell phone Wi Fi. And and landline plus but at home you switched over with you guys you you kind of basically matched basically correct?"" [Agent] ""It is the same. Yes ma'am."" [Customer] ""Just tie in your op everything was optimum like in terms of business and personal, correct at home?"" [Agent] ""Um, so when you say home, are you talking about home internet are you talking about just a cell phone I do not, I do not want to confuse the two."" [Customer] ""Oh, I am sorry, um."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""It would be for, for, um, you know, home internet as well as cell phone usage when I, I think my cell phone usage, I use Verizon, like when I go out."" [Agent] ""Got you. So for, for Verizon, how much are you paying for your cell phone service?"" [Customer] ""Oh God, my husband pays for that, so I do not know. Um, I think, I think that we have right we have my husband, myself, my kids, my X kids. I think we pay like XXX. Maybe for everybody, I do not know, I do not know."" [Agent] ""So that that is where the savings would be."" [Customer] ""Maybe."" [Agent] ""So if you are tied with Verizon and you are paying well over $100 and that is where the savings will come from. But if you are um saying, hey, you pay $45 for your phone use for your internet, then that would not really save you the discount on here because it is for um home service, home internet service that is your cell phone service."" [Customer] ""I am saying"" [Agent] ""um, let me see what I can do give me one second, let me. Let me see if this works. Mhm And hello from Texas by the way. I just realized you said Connecticut. hello howdy."" [Customer] ""I know, no wonder you are so friendly because you know you are you are a Southerner, oh"" [Agent] ""Howdy"" [Customer] ""Oh, holy, that, that is."" [Agent] ""Um Um, let us see if this will work, um."" [Customer] ""Oh."" [Agent] ""You might hear me talking to myself for a moment, just bear with me one second. I think that would work. We Oh Right Yeah, I did not came in here. So, What I will do since you made me laugh. And I appreciate that."" [Customer] ""No Oh, you are so, you are so sweet.""

Oh, what time is it being tax? Is it like, are you like X o'clock right now?"" [Agent] ""It is X a.m. It is not"" [Customer] ""Oh wow. OK. I have a friend who lives in Texas.""

T-Mobile, Verizon, or whoever your current provider is, you would be paying Optimum then you would save $40 on your business account Because right now you are paying $75 a month, but if you were to switch and you have a very impressive rate because you have some credits from our attention, so for example if you were to bundle that with with our mobile and an unlimited mobile plan for us is $45 but then you would save $40 on your business account that would bring your account down to like $35 a month sir by switching over to the mobile service."" [Customer] ""OK. Alright, let us do that."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Yeah, that is that is the moment, yeah.""

Yeah, that is, uh, pretty impressive rate and the network that we use for mobile, I am not sure what network you use, but in case you are wondering what the network is, it is T-Mobile, sir, so we are part of the largest XG network."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I am, I am a mobile."" [Agent] ""So instead of paying T-Mobile directly, you would be paying Optimum Mobile then you would be getting, uh, you know Some uh credits here bear with me."" [Customer] ""OK.""

[Customer] ""It was fiber only at first. I changed it to fiber capable yes, for the market to get changed"" [Agent] ""Yeah, no, that is fine, yeah, just as long as I can proceed with the collect rates on the transfer."" [Customer] ""OK. OK, you want one gig OK, you can market"" [Agent] ""Whatever. Yeah, no, it is fine."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""It should still, the rate should still populate though, no?"" [Customer] ""Yes, yes, they should."" [Agent] ""Yeah It was just because it said fiber only?"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I think IDA takes a little bit of time to um catch up. Alright, let us see. Mhm. Yeah, now it is, now it is showing."" [Customer] ""OK good"" [Agent] ""I did the same thing before, I promise you I do not know I guess it is just an IDA. The delay, yeah.""

[Agent] ""Yeah, you are moving, so for some reason it is not letting the rate uh transfer because they gave you gave you like a X year offer or something, but I am going to see what I could do to keep you close to that, and then you would get the $40 discount with the internet, um, I mean the mobile, so bear with me, OK."" [Customer] ""OK Oh"" [Agent] ""On me a moment and then your rate would start all over again when you move so your promotion resets there, OK."" [Customer] ""Thank"" [Agent] ""Thank you for your patience with me this morning."" [Customer] ""Um"" [Agent] ""Alright, let us see what we can do special offers. Right, so I was able to get it back to the, so you are at the same $75 with the retention offer that you had you would get a X year price guarantee with that rate so versus a X year, OK Um, and then let us see."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Oh let us just see if I can accommodate the date for you. And then you can just take your equipment from your current location and bring it to the new location, OK?"" [Customer] ""What we are doing construction over there and it seem like it is misplaced and I just can not relocate it right now."" [Agent] ""So I can have the tech bring new equipment um if they do then you I just do not want you to be charged for any unreturned equipment at the old if that makes sense? I do not know, uh, usually the modem I am not sure you are not sure where the modem is in the other place"" [Customer] ""Yeah Yes, um, as soon as I, I, I could locate it and I would take it for the.""

Let me go ahead and put the pricing together for you and I will give you that information just putting them together right now."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Thank you for your patience.

[Agent] ""So, um, once again I can give you a gig speed of service because for the amount of cameras that you are going to see it is the."" [Customer] ""I do not think I need a good speed of service."" [Agent] ""That is what would be suggested again the difference in pricing."" [Customer] ""OK, well, what is the cheapest, the cheapest option available?"" [Agent] ""OK, so let us start with what you should receive, and then we can go from there. Um, the X year promotion on the gig speed of service, including the modem, the router, and the connection fail over service, that is going to go ahead and be $145."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""That would be the installation would be $100 the monthly rate would be $145 So you are set for X years. Includes your gigee the service. You are not going to have buffering on it. It is not going to go ahead and drop your connection if you need to add any any additional cameras on, you would be able to go ahead and do so without any problems If you wanted to do a X year promotion, I can bring that down to XXX, and that would still be the same gig speed of service, still no contract, no cancellation charges. That would be a X year promo again, same quality, same everything, just a X year promotion as opposed to a X year promotion. If you go ahead and do the XXX speed, it is $10 less for um for the service so you can do the XXX speed and it would still be a X year promotion. It would go ahead and be $150."" [Customer] ""What is the cheapest option?"" [Agent] ""The least expensive option would be the XXX speed, and the XXX speed can either do a X year promotion or a X year promotion and the pricing on that, bear with me just a couple of seconds, that is something that we usually go with let us take a look. If you go with the XXX speed on a X year on a X year promotion, that would be XX and if you go with a X year promo, let me tell you what."" [Customer] ""So why, why, why is it online and seeing $60 a month for?"" [Agent] ""That is not that is including a $5 discount for auto pay and paperless and not including your failover system. So basically for."" [Customer] ""I do not know what a cavers this is."" [Agent] ""That is why I am here to, that is why I am here to answer that for you. Uh, connection failover system is basically just in case the main internet fails, it automatically switches over to your LTE service. So that means that at no time will your cameras be without internet service. So even if it takes a."" [Customer] ""I do not need to fail over."" [Agent] ""OK, and keep in mind that that normally is $30 and because you are a new customer you are getting a $10 multi-product discount which is getting it for $20 a month but you decide. So let us say for argument's sake I start repricing you without the fail over system, OK? And this price is the prices that I have been giving you does not include the $5 discount for auto pay and paperless, so if you wanted to do that."" [Customer] ""I, I want, I want the I want the bottom line, the, the, the, the bottom line cheapest option to get in the door with all the promotions, everything I need to know the bottom line"" [Agent] ""OK. OK, so if you do the."" [Customer] ""No, I am not looking for anything fancy."" [Agent] ""OK. One year promotion with $300 speed including the $5 discount for auto pay is $60."" [Customer] ""Perfect, set me up with that please."" [Agent] ""OK, so this is short term basically this is not something that you are looking to do long term."" [Customer] ""It is something that I am looking to do right now."" [Agent] ""Just confirming."" [Customer] ""I, I do not know about long term or short term."" [Agent] ""Uh OK."" [Customer] ""I just need to get internet. I got to get cameras working and uh."" [Agent] ""Unders"" [Customer] ""Everything else after that is negotiable."" [Agent] ""Understood. So let me go ahead and put those codings in the system for you, and then we will go from there. Just a couple of seconds and I appreciate your patience. OK, so right now the pricing is $65. If you would like for me to add the $5 discount for autopay and paperless, I would just need to take the payment of $160 and I set you up for that if you want to do the auto pay."" [Customer] ""So you, you just need to take a payment for what?"" [Agent] ""For $160 which is the installation of $100 and the $60 for the first month I set you up for the autopay and paperless If you do not want to make a payment at this time, that is not an issue. We put through the order and so $100 monthly rate $65 when you sign up for auto pay and paperless through your what portal, you will get the extra $5 discount So it depends on you wanting to make a payment at this time or not. It is up to you."" [Customer] ""Um, OK."" [Agent] ""Would you like to"" [Customer] ""It, uh, I, I just do not have the information in front of me, so I will take care of it as soon as I get the, you know, in my office and I.""

You would call technical support, and they will help you set up an online web portal and once you have that online web portal you can set up your autopay and paperless at that point, OK?"" [Customer] ""Um, you saying I have to call back again to get, to get an account?"" [Agent] ""OK, no, I am setting up your appointment, your installation. I am setting everything up right now.

So most parents, you know, think it is the beginning of the school or end of the school or um back after like a holiday vacation cause they go, they visit cousins in another state to get advice from those cousins, bring it back, share it with their friends.

So it is going to give you the coverage that you need um it is also going to come with all the equipment so you are going to get a gateway, a router, a modem and uh with business everything is professionally installed. So what is going to happen is the tech is going to come and install everything at your location, including uh the equipment."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""I just wanted to now you did say you have electricity, right?"" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""OK awesome now as far as um optimum services work um we do not need you or we do not want you to do anything but focus primarily on the business so understand that all your equipment is going to be protected and it is going to be covered um with our protection and support. Also keep in mind though that even if it is not if it does not say optimum on it. You want to check with us to see if you have any eligible devices, so it might be a monitor, it might be a TV screen, it might be a camera, it might be, you know, whatever it is instead of, you know, you run into the store or hopping on Amazon, we just recommend that you check in with us first to see if we cover it."" [Customer] ""OK.""

[Agent] ""Um, now the track phone, what kind of phone is it? Is it a flip phone or what type of phone is it?"" [Customer] ""No, it is a gel growth I."" [Agent] ""OK, so keep in mind what you can do is if you wanted to bring that over to Optimum and you can keep the phone number and everything, you would also get a $40 credit on your internet bill and that is going to be for the lifetime that you have the phone with us. So you know, keep that in mind."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""I can look into that for you today or I can send you an email, um, but you know business are taking advantage of that hundreds of people are doing that because they are keeping their phone and they are getting a credit on their bill plus our unlimited plans only $45 so it actually works out to you paying about $5 for the phone once you know once you get the credit."" [Customer] ""OK, yeah, I am just, um, today is just getting quotes from internet providers, um, to, to see what I need to do to get internet set up."" [Agent] ""Mhm.""

[Agent] ""So what is it specifically that you are, you know, you are shopping for so I can you know, see if I can make sure you do not have to do anything else"" [Customer] ""Affordability and um yeah, affordability and um because the clinical trial sponsors are the ones that are basically paying for this."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""So I have to make sure that I am most affordable option right now. um and then of course when the clinical trial is over, I will obviously have to keep it because we need the internet anyway."" [Agent] ""Right."" [Customer] ""um, but for startups, they are the ones that are are paying for it. Um, and I just need like the basic internet that, you know, is not going to lag because, um, you know, um, me and my other employee are checking emails at the same time I just watching a movie in the other room"" [Agent] ""OK. Got it. OK, so I get that and thank you for explaining that. Now it is good that they are going to cover it, but like you said, eventually you are going to be paying it."" [Customer] ""Yeah.""

What I can do is I can set this up."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""I can have this waived. I just would need to get confirmation from a supervisor and this way, you know, we can keep you locked in and have something set up now we do not do contracts, uh, me, so that is what I want you to keep in mind as your account manager, yeah, it is month to month."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK, so it is monthly, that is good.""

Are, are you paying more than $45 for your cell phone?"" [Customer] ""Uh, right along there, maybe a little less."" [Agent] ""OK, well, the reason why I ask because we do have a plan going on where you can sign up with unlimited talk, text and internet service for $45 and then once you sign up for that, you get $40 off of your internet bill. So it is only $5 extra bucks to get a cell phone service. We are running off of the T-Mobile towers. You can keep the same telephone number and keep your same physical phone, or if I, or if you wanted to have XX numbers on that one phone that you are using today, I can do that for you too as well so you can separate your business life from your personal life.""

[Agent] ""OK. No worries, so nothing is due up front, nothing is due today, and nothing is due when the technician gets out there, which I am checking to see how fast I can get them out there for you guys, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""just another moment. Now, in the event that you call and if you want to make any changes, ask any questions for this particular account, we are going to ask you to to verify a X digit pin number so we know that it is you, Mr. Grant.""

Call219,"[Agent] ""Thank you for calling Optim Business. This is Jared speaking. How can I help you?"" [Customer] ""Hey Jared, I am calling about the business connection backup."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""I just wanted to get some more information about that and see if I could sign up for it."" [Agent] ""Absolutely. Absolutely and your name is?"" [Customer] ""Carlene Frederick."" [Agent] ""Hi Darlene, if for some reason we get disconnected, what is the best number to get reach you back?"" [Customer] ""XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Agent] ""OK, give me one second, I am going to pull this up right now I believe. The account number generated. Just give me one second please, and this is for Jojo's Juice bar XXX Brooklyn Avenue, correct?"" [Customer] ""That is correct."" [Agent] ""Alright, one second, everything's opening now. Hey Carlene, do you have the X digit access code that is on the account?"" [Customer] ""Um, is it XXXX?"" [Agent] ""Yes, it is excellent thank you very much."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""uh, let me get into this account and get a look at everything."" [Customer] ""So"" [Agent] ""Right, so How many devices do you have hooked up to the Internet when it is busiest there?"" [Customer] ""Uh, XXXX, so we have a POS and X tablets. X tablets, cameras, you know, like wireless printers, what? Right, so there is a wireless printer, so you need to change. So we have XXX printers, X POS, and X tablets. OK, oK, do you let customers connect to the internet? Really? So when the customers are there they connect to the internet as well? Mhm. OK Yeah, but very rare. It does not happen very often. Right, OK, alright, so we are looking at we have the two phone lines, the connection back up Yeah. That Alright, yes, so the connection back up is $30. Mhm. Uh, this will take on, you know, keep your point of sale up and running um, if there is any outages, you know, if there is any outages in the area OK. That is it, uh, So how does that work then? If there is an outage, how does this backup work? What it does is just it will kick on, yeah, it will kick on automatically. To keep everything running. It works like, um, very much how like your phone switches from Wi Fi to data when you do not have service. It is very much like that. OK. Alright. OK. So we would just have to get a tech to come out and install this bad boy but just hold on now. Now do you do your own tech support as well? When you say on tech support, meaning what if something goes wrong we try to fix it also. Like this Yeah, like, uh, if you have a laptop down or something like that or your point of sale or anything like that. Uh, but our point of sales usually I connect with the company for the POS and they will run us through any type of tech support. Great OK, because we also have um. It is, it is called the Sherry and basically it is, it is a, it is like your own personal geek squad, but it is also comes with $10,000 of product protection a year. Mhm. So say, uh, say God forbid the, the shop is struck by lightning. Right. Everything gets fried out, your televisions, your computers you know this will replace up to $10,000 of equipment a year OK. So we can add that No, that will not be fun because we have the other insurances and stuff already, so that is fine. You do? OK, good. I am glad that we are, we are in New York. Everything's expensive. That is why I try to offer everything we can you know what I mean Yeah, of course, yeah. I am out I am out east I mean, you are in Nassau County, so you get it you know what I mean We have to, it is XXX back out of our driveway, you know what I mean? Yeah, understood. It is expensive. Definitely. Mhm. Alright, so yeah, but adding the, uh, the backup's only $30. Alright, no installation fee and I can have someone there, uh, tomorrow. So this is $30 per month that we add to the bill? Yes ma'am. Yep OK, and um so this will provide backups for all of the devices that we have? Try it out and it. Uh, the, the main one, so this will be the main like your point of sale things like it will keep everything up and running, you know, in case of an outage or if there is a bad one in case, you know, until we have a tech get there. OK. OK, so the point of sale and the tablets that I mentioned previously, those will be up on those will still running. Now Yeah That should be fine. Yes, on, on the day of installation, is it best to have the tech call you at the XXXX number? OK. All right. Uh, yes, but before we got there. Sure. Let me just ask a few more questions. Absolutely. So does this have different tiers, different levels, just like sometimes your plan does is this just one standard price, one standard Yeah this is just yeah this is just one stand because you are just paying for, you know the equipment and then the monthly uh for this one Yeah Yeah. OK, alright. So, but, but there is also, like I said, there is XX day money back guarantee. Try it out for XX to XX days and then I think you know you will you will see that, you know, one busy day in the sub pay for itself, you know what I mean. Mhm. So Mm. Right, what exactly does he need to install when he, when the check is here then? What, what is being installed? Yeah, he is going to come it is, it is a, it is a small device he is going to come install near the modem. OK, near the modem. OK, alright, so that is what is going to kick in to give us that backup we need. Yeah, yes OK. All right, so we can go ahead and schedule that. Alright, I have XX to X and X to X tomorrow. How long will the process take you know Uh, I usually, they usually tell me to say an hour, but I mean if, if there is no obstruction, it could be done quicker, it really depends.

[Customer] ""Ah, Yes Yeah, sure."" [Agent] ""I do not know because I mean we are talking you have XXX speed, which that is uh severely outdated I am going to work on, so what I am going to do is I am going to try and work on getting you the best uh upgrade I could possibly get, which would probably keep you in the same neighborhood of what you are paying if you know what I mean, um you are going to be getting a lot more for what you are paying for, so"" [Customer] ""Yes They will take out for a cup of coffee or a beer, one of the."" [Agent] ""Alright, so Rakesh, just give me, bear with me a few moments.

[Customer] ""There is the owner and all like that you are talking to them you know"" [Agent] ""Hello Rakesh."" [Customer] ""Yeah, sure."" [Agent] ""Alright, alright, so basically I was looking over, um, you know, a lot of the different, you know, companies of yours and a lot of the ones in the area and basically what they have, they have the gig internet so that would be a significant, uh, increase what you have because you are at X XXX that'll bring you to XXXX. So you would be at the gig internet you would be set from there"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So if we did the, and most of them, they have a few other things. They have the XX hour tech support the product protection along with the emergency connection back up The connection back up, that is a device that kicks in if your internet goes down very much like how your phone switches over from Wi Fi to data."" [Customer] ""Mhm mhm."" [Agent] ""OK, so if we put all of them on there, you upgraded to the gig, it would be a difference about $92 a month, so your new bill will be about $410. That is going to the gig."" [Customer] ""Oh Lord. Yeah, no, I do not think I have that much bandwidth to support that. What if we just do XXX without the other?"" [Agent] ""OK, I could see I can make I can make an adjustment and just check on XXX for sure."" [Customer] ""Yeah, please. I appreciate that."" [Agent] ""Let us see."" [Customer] ""I know for you guys it is nothing but."" [Agent] ""Well, it is, it is, I want to make sure you have one enough coverage, you know I mean, a lot of devices are pulling a lot of bandwidth these, you know what I mean, so I want to make sure you are covered, you know because right now you are definitely underpowered"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah Yeah, I understand."" [Agent] ""That is, that is for sure you know what I mean, so I want to make sure you have everything you need there So let me get that. Let us make an adjustment here and then we will make the uh. If that comes off."" [Customer] ""Yeah, and do not add any of those protections and all like that please."" [Agent] ""I am sorry you you sound really far away again I apologize."" [Customer] ""I said yeah, no, no, I said do not add any of those protections."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""But uh Yeah, just"" [Agent] ""Yeah, so honestly if you upgrade to the $500 yeah, it is only a difference of $42 so that is, uh, and that is the same thing, so that is, you know, the. Uh, more than doubling. I am sorry, it is more than doubling what you have now since you are at XXX. So that I think it will fix all your connectivity issues."" [Customer] ""Yeah, so it is uh What will, what, what are all, uh what are the options Is there any option that I can take off to get it car lower or no?"" [Agent] ""Not at this point. After you get this, what I usually suggest everyone get the installation then if you have a good pay history, Optimal will always work with you So if you wait like X months and you say, hey, you know what, you mean you are a bit strapped on the bill, something like that, you could say, hey, I just upgraded and they will work with you."" [Customer] ""So you are saying this will be like. The new rate will be like XXX something."" [Agent] ""Yeah this would be XXX."" [Customer] ""Oh, so XXX plus what got you got you."" [Agent] ""So we XXX, there is no installation fee or anything this will be good this one's good for X years"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""So this for this price is good for X years, it will not change."" [Customer] ""OK, yeah, let us do that."" [Agent] ""Alright, so we are going to do that now. I am just going to get that then we are going to get the date Alright, and then on the day of installation is it best for the tech to call you at the XXX-X number?"" [Customer] ""Yes, sure."" [Agent] ""Alright, so just hang out with me one second. We are going to get those dates now then we will set everything up Now I have an email here of RLG environmental at. Yahoo.com, that is still the best email?"" [Customer] ""Yes, please."" [Agent] ""OK, excellent so that is where the order email is going to go do you guys have mobile like mobile lines for the business"" [Customer] ""No, no, we do not."" [Agent] ""Because if you bundle a mobile line or a tablet, bring a phone, whatever it is, I can give you a $40 discount."" [Customer] ""So I mean we do, we do have phone connection I am not sure what mobile is"" [Agent] ""Yeah, like a cell phone, like a cell phone or a tablet line.""

And how many people will be using your internet service? OK. And how many devices will be connected to the Internet, ma'am? X OK, any security cameras? No. OK, um, and are you going to do auto pay no auto pay Mm Usually my accounting team just pays through the portal monthly I think we can set up an autopay once we, we are only going to be there for a few months, so, no, no, uh no answer is no to autopay OK, so I would recommend the X gig, um, it is no contract we are month to month, so we are prepaid, uh, it comes on a X year promotion meaning that the price will be locked in for X years. equipment is included. We do not charge you a rental fee. We do not charge you anything. You are just using our equipment, um, and it is XXX with auto pay or XXX without the auto pay. What is just the basic internet option? I do not think they need one gift. OK, let me check on the basic price. And do you need a static IP by chance? No. OK. I do not even know what that means, but Um, like, for example, whenever you work from home like myself, um, to have a secure internet line, uh, some companies do require a static IP. I do not think so. Oh No. No, ma'am, I do not need it. OK. Thank you for explaining. Absolutely. I am not very tacky. I, I was not either. I learned a lot working here. I bet. So $80 a month is for the $300 most basic internet package that we have. OK, that is fine. OK. I also have XXX megabytes, that is like in the mid-range that one is XXX a month Mm, just, I will just do the XXX. OK. They are, I mean, they are going to be maybe on their phone, they. And now we do have a one time installation fee. It is $100 and it is built to your first month so. OK. And you said no auto pay? No. OK, so without the auto pay it is $5 more. OK. XX a month. My first available to get your services installed is the 27th. I have between X and X. It is good. OK. Next Tuesday. Yep. OK. OK And we have to do a check. And then your Yeah, we do not offer self installs for business customers because we have to maintain a certain level of quality. OK. A lot of times when they do that that they do not do the right thing so then it postpones everything. OK. Alright, and then, um, the first bill is going to be due X days after the install. OK. Alrighty ma'am, I have you scheduled for the 27th between X to X technician will call you XX minutes before arriving. Um, can I call you on the same phone number you are calling from do you want to change that number to a different number No, that is that is perfect. Uh, this phone number is XXX-XXXXXXXXX. Awesome, OK, add that in for you. Alrighty. Um, just to let you know, you have you have the opportunity to save $15 off your internet bill if you bundle with Optimum mobile cell phone service Um, do you currently have a cell phone provider for your business? I do. You do? How much are you paying? Oh, I do not know, it is through the company, so I do not, I do not have access to any of that. Got you.

Obviously it could be your internet speed, but how many connected devices are are in the office there"" [Customer] ""Oh,"" [Agent] ""So, and everything, so like whether it is a, a computer, printers, computers, uh, cameras, WiFi cameras, if you have TV if you are streaming, um, personal devices, if you, if you, if yeah, if you guys hook up to the office Wi Fi, that counts."" [Customer] ""Including printers and everything. My phone, right? Yeah, yeah. Alright, so a lot, uh, well, not a lot compared to what you guys see, but. XXX-XXX downstairs and upstairs is. Huh XXX. Maybe XX to XX devices."" [Agent] ""OK, um. Yeah, so I honestly, with that many connected devices, I do not recommend you going any lower than a gig. And the reasons being is because obviously the amount of devices you have, you know, will, will just for argument's sake, you know, XX to XX devices, um, and especially is that, um, what kind of office is it?"" [Customer] ""OK, so No law office, law office real estate management right."" [Agent] ""Is that like a accounting law firm? Law office, OK. Got you so I am sure you are dealing with a lot of uploads and downloads, documents, leases. Um, things like that."" [Customer] ""Mhm Right.""

[Agent] ""XXX megabits per 2nd, X, yeah, so yeah, obviously the more room you have."" [Customer] ""No, I understand all like the specs yeah, I get that part I just, I just need to know the.""

And do you know if you guys are signed up for auto pay?"" [Customer] ""No."" [Agent] ""OK, because if you enroll in autopay, you could save an additional $5 a month on your bill."" [Customer] ""I do not think so."" [Agent] ""Uh, so I will look into that."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Alright, so Raquel, if you were to, if we were to upgrade you from the XXX speed all the way up to X gig. It is X times the speed X times the bandwidth It also comes with our business premier protection and support, which you do not have. Um, it would only be an additional $50 a month to the monthly bill. OK."" [Customer] ""Hold on X 2nd."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""OK, and what is the next? Tear down."" [Agent] ""OK, OK, one second. So the next tier down is XXX speed. Um,"" [Customer] ""Right, you can hold on one second I am sorry"" [Agent] ""No, you do."" [Customer] ""Hi, OK, so the next one."" [Agent] ""OK, the next one down is a XXX speed, but uh, but that is actually the same price, so it does not really um pay to do that one you are getting."" [Customer] ""It is XXX it is the same price mark."" [Agent] ""Yeah, you are getting a special on the one gig."" [Customer] ""He is given us a special on the one gig. How long is the special for?"" [Agent] ""So X uh XX months but no contract, so obviously, um."" [Customer] ""We no contact."" [Agent] ""Uh, you can check it out if you know if you are not, yeah, if you are not happy with with the one gig you can obviously decrease, but that is going to give you, that is going to give you what you need."" [Customer] ""One gig. is Yeah, OK, so we are going to go ahead and upgrade."" [Agent] ""Got you sweet."" [Customer] ""Go ahead, we are going to go ahead and up it right, can you grab that."" [Agent] ""So Sounds good."" [Customer] ""I am sorry."" [Agent] ""I am also going to send you a $50 gift card, OK, for uh for upgrading, right?"" [Customer] ""Yeah. OK perfect."" [Agent] ""Great, uh, I am also going to waive the installation fees normally XXX bucks, but I am going to waive that for you, OK?"" [Customer] ""Yeah"" [Agent] ""And I will try and get a"" [Customer] ""I was saying that he does not want to uh. He is saying that he wants to make sure that our devices are still going to work because he had an experience at his house where they upgraded the internet like their cam their Google cameras were not working"" [Agent] ""Well, yeah, you, well, you kinda have to, you you are going to have to connect everything to the new network because you are we are going to swap out your modem, so, um Obviously when the technician comes."" [Customer] ""It is not going to take us back until I swap the modem, right?"" [Agent] ""Correct, yeah, not until the technician is in there and unplugs your old modem and then plugs back in the new, uh, plugs in the new modem, connects all the, the, the corresponding cables and things like that."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So you will see a, a small period of downtime when the tech is doing his thing, but obviously when everything is up and running, whatever devices are right now connected to your modem, you are going to have to reconnect those because obviously it is a new Wi Fi network. Uh, new Wi Fi password and, and all that stuff, so there will, so there will be some configuration."" [Customer] ""OK, even even hard line or just."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so, so I, I, yeah, everything."" [Customer] ""Chits everything, so I should just pay for a computer guy to be here when the OK."" [Agent] ""Right, yes, if you have an IT guy have him there um so that way he can, he can configure everything."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Alright, so just give me a few moments here. X To bring up my calendar, obviously, uh, you know, since you are having a hard time with the internet now, I will try and get a tech out there as soon as I can, OK?"" [Customer] ""He said hold on let me write all this down because he did say some good stuff that is going to waive installation fee."" [Agent] ""We have installation, $50 gift card."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So why is it not letting me add the gift card? Hold on one moment. She is not letting me add the gift card for some odd reason. I got to see if the promo is still going on for that."" [Customer] ""I send them"" [Agent] ""Uh So I apologize for the gift card Raquel. uh, so no gift card. Sorry about that. Um, that that promotion must have just ended because I was able to do it yesterday, but for some reason today it is saying that I can not do it anymore."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Um, so yeah, but other than that, everything else, you know, free install so you save XXX bucks right there, um"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""This is going to be a X year promo, um. No contract, so additional $500 for the monthly bill, $52.55 dollars to be exact, so your new total is only $365 before tax, and then."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, let us see what about the calendar."" [Customer] ""If possible, like really they and um. Probably after X if you guys offer that?"" [Agent] ""Uh, we have a X to X depending on the area. Newer show it is possible. I got to see sometimes we have like a X to X time slot, um. But I got to see what pops up here. So the earliest I can get someone there would be tomorrow. Um, the time slots that I have are 11:00 a.m. to X p.m. or X to X."" [Customer] ""Mm."" [Agent] ""Usual I mean"" [Customer] ""No."" [Agent] ""So, in my experience, I do not necessarily like doing the X to X time slot because a lot of the time the tech comes after X p.m. Not to say that you know I and me telling you that watch him come at X o'clock tomorrow, um."" [Customer] ""Right, right, so you are saying that you are saying that the wired wired devices should be unphased when they change everything else, change."" [Agent] ""Anything connected to Ethernet should be OK. Um, obviously, um, confirm with the installation technician and your IT guy. uh, but theoretically speaking, it is, it is hardwired, so there is nothing really to configure it. You do not have to put in any sort of Wi Fi password or anything like that. Any other devices that are connected to the modem via Wi Fi. Obviously, printers and phones and tablets, cameras, other PCs that are not ethernet connected, you know, obviously."" [Customer] ""I think everything is pretty much hardwired."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so there should not be, there should not be any sort of issue there um the only time you are going to have to reconfigure stuff is anything that is connected to the modem via Wi Fi where you have to put in a WiFi password and things like that, um."" [Customer] ""OK, so that is X to X is not going to work. It has to be something after X."" [Agent] ""Got you. Um, if after X is not going to work. I have early morning like I have X a.m. to XX a.m."" [Customer] ""No."" [Agent] ""On any given day, uh, Tuesday the twenty-seventh, so next week."" [Customer] ""Um, Hold on"" [Agent] ""Um, I do have Saturdays available if um."" [Customer] ""You know what, it is fine, we will do tomorrow X to X hold on."" [Agent] ""OK, great."" [Customer] ""Well Thursday. Uh, X to X is fine, right?"" [Agent] ""OK, great."" [Customer] ""And then. That way because if not the computer guy said he can come Friday. So as long as we get"" [Agent] ""Got you."" [Customer] ""Everything hard line is going to work."" [Agent] ""Right, just, um, whoever is going to be there tomorrow in the office just let obviously the technician is going to know, um, because he will see how things are set up just, you know, make sure you ask him"" [Customer] ""Then she will be fine. river. Uh huh"" [Agent] ""Just make sure he knows how you want your your stuff set up."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Please call."" [Customer] ""Yes. X to X OK."" [Agent] ""Raquel, what is what is the best number for the technician to reach out to tomorrow afternoon."" [Customer] ""Uh, I will give you my cell phone number XXX-XXX."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Mhm."" [Customer] ""XXXX."" [Agent] ""Um, great, and to kind of. To kind of offset the cost, Raquel, um, you, you know, you do now that you are going with the X gig, uh, plan, you do, you are eligible for an additional discount here. So essentially, um, that XXX that is going to be your new bill that can come down by $40 so it can come down to $225 when you bundle in."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""A mobile phone. So whether Mark wants to switch his mobile from his current company to Optimum Mobile, and we connect it to the account, uh, one on the T."" [Customer] ""How is your coverage? Is it a number that you are giving us that."" [Agent] ""No, no, no, so, so you, you have options. So, um, so Optimum Mobile is actually, uh, works with, uh, T-Mobile. So we are on the T-Mobile network, um, so essentially it is T-Mobile service you are just getting billed from Optimum."" [Customer] ""So how are we going to save $45 and then get it if it is like $45 save $40 a month for how long?"" [Agent] ""You save XX $40 a month indefinitely as long as you have the mobile phone connected to the account obviously on the back end, um you will you will continue to receive that $40 off um, obviously if you think about it over the next XX months, that is $1000 you are going to save on your internet bill then the cost of the mobile line"" [Customer] ""Well And is it a number?"" [Agent] ""So you have two options. Um, either you know, either you, Raquel, or Mark can bring your personal numbers over from your current company to Optimum Mobile and treat it as a business mobile account even though it is your personal cell, uh, you know, uh, I would assume Mark may be interested in doing this. Uh, because that is obviously it is, it is his office there. So if Mark wanted to bring his personal cell phone number from his current provider over to Optimum Mobile and we connected to the account here for, for the office, his cell phone account, even though it is his personal, would be would be transitioned into what we into a quote business account. A business mobile account, um, and then the cost of his cell phone bill, which he is paying for anyway as long as he brings over his number and his current phone, um, is only $45 a month for unlimited talk and text and data so you get unlimited everything on the T-Mobile network."" [Customer] ""OK So it will be $375,370 so it is $5 more then."" [Agent] ""Your bill goes from $365 to $325 then the cost of his cell phone bill is only $45 So, um. So essentially it is $5 more, but technically, um, you are saving $1000 over the next XX months on your internet bill because if, if you think about it, he is paying for his cell phone anyway with his current company, however much that is, whether it is."" [Customer] ""No, I know he may just want a new business Hold on one second."" [Agent] ""You could do that too?"" [Customer] ""Instead of a cell phone line, can you offer a telephone over internet line?"" [Agent] ""Like a, like a voice over IP? No, so that that bundle discount is, is, is specifically with mobile. So if, if he, if he said he wanted, if you mentioned that he may want to just to open up a mobile account."" [Customer] ""It is"" [Agent] ""Specifically for the office there, you can do that too. There is obviously two ways you can do that. Um, you will get, obviously you will get a brand new phone number for the office uh, cell phone You can either, um use a device you already have lying around the house, uh, so that way you do not have to pay for a new phone"" [Customer] ""Yeah, my boss hook it up to his iPad?"" [Agent] ""Um, you can do an iPad yes, you can It is the same price, $45 if you want to do an iPad rather than a mobile phone. You will and you will still receive that $40 discount."" [Customer] ""So now I am getting charged $45 for $45 discount and just added $5 on stuff."" [Agent] ""Essentially it is it is essentially it is kind of evening itself out because I am going to discount your internet bill by $40 then the mobile, I am sorry, the, the iPad line which is which is considered a mobile is, is $45 for unlimited data"" [Customer] ""Oh For unlimited data for $5 extra. Yeah, and I"" [Agent] ""Yes, after all the discounts are applied. So you are still going to get you are still going to get, um just, just so we are clear, you are still going to get a cell phone bill for the iPad for $45 It shows your internet bill is going to be, uh, it is going to be uh decreasing by $40 so it is so it kind of evens itself out that way so you still, you still will have the two, the two different bills, um. But all together once the discounts are all applied it is only $5 extra."" [Customer] ""Um,"" [Agent] ""Does that make sense?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, cause you are saying if I get if I get if I can buy an extra line. You discount my. So they are offering to give, yeah right."" [Agent] ""Yeah, and it is specifically a mobile line whether you do a cell phone or an iPad, so either one."" [Customer] ""And it is Optimum business partner with T-Mobile, right?"" [Agent] ""Optimum business partner with T-Mobile correct."" [Customer] ""OK and I, I do that. Cell phone line and cancel my other cell phone line."" [Agent] ""Like your personal cell phone line?"" [Customer] ""No, I have a business so online I just have it on a different business."" [Agent] ""Oh, so if you wanted to say, um. Bring that number over, you can definitely use that number and that and that device as long as you are not in any sort of contract with your with that mobile provider you could definitely do that."" [Customer] ""My T-Mobile is the mobile provider."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so essentially, essentially, um, you are not essentially you are not going to see any difference in your service quality."" [Customer] ""Oh"" [Agent] ""You are just going to get billed from us instead of T-Mobile and save $40 a month on your internet for the office here. So it actually works out better for you."" [Customer] ""More because that you are saying yeah you pay full price for your. I am going to go double check on that. Do I have to do it today?"" [Agent] ""No, you do not have to do it today. Uh, so what I am going to do, Mark, is I am going to send Raquel an email from my work email address. I do not have a direct phone number where you can call me.

[Agent] ""You know, sometimes as Latin people we speak too quickly and you know, too much spice in it."" [Customer] ""I hear you. Yeah"" [Agent] ""Too much spice and then we speak too quickly and then you know put our foot in our mouth, not intentionally though, alrighty, I love, so what I get to do, uh, for a valued customer like yourself when you move, we get to reset your promotion."" [Customer] ""Amen."" [Agent] ""So basically your promotion was basically um due to end, um, beginning of next year. What I am able to go ahead and do when you transfer your services is that we are able to provide it to you on a X year promotion without any contracts or cancellation charge. Just for the services, so just sit tight once again I am just putting the codes into the system. I understand that you want your phone service. The phone is a voice over internet protocol phone service, which means that the phone works over the Internet service."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So in order to provide you the service, we would need the internet needs to stay on the account, so just giving you um the price instructions."" [Customer] ""OK, that is fine. That is fine. I, I do not mind if the internet is on the account."" [Agent] ""Mhm, yeah, perfect."" [Customer] ""It is what it is."" [Agent] ""And the good thing is is that we are going to be able to give you promotions and it is going to go ahead and extend not just for X year but another X years. So good stuff. And if the technician gives you new equipment, as I mentioned, it is not a problem."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Just to take from me a few moments. Let me add the discount code to this and then we will go from there. OK OK, that is there. That is your phone, of course, because you are staying within the same town and zip code you have to keep the same phone number, so that works. OK, so basically including your modem, your router, your phone number, and the $5 discount for auto pay and paperless, the monthly rate would just go ahead and be $145. Your estimated reoccurring taxes for $6.71. The transfer of the service or. The installation of the new location, activation, the visit, however you want to call it, the installation is $100 and that gets billed out to you. Technician will go to your location and wherever you want your modem to be installed, whether it is next to your station, you know, so that you can, um, you know, be responsible for that one just on its own that that is where the technician will install it. I just suggest do not, do not ask him to hang it from like chandeliers and stuff, you know, because fancy, you know, hair salons and stuff, so I do not think he is going to do that, OK, Miss Laurel."" [Customer] ""OK. All right. I will just make sure, I will make a note of that."" [Agent] ""OK, just saying, you know, we want to be accommodating you know"" [Customer] ""That is a little much."" [Agent] ""Mm That is all but"" [Customer] ""Gotcha."" [Agent] ""Just a little bit alrighty my dear, so let us go ahead and take a look and see what the date is going to give us as an installation and then we will go from there, OK."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Alrighty then, would you like an X to XXXX to X? What is your goal? What time do you actually open? Like, are you going to be there at X do you prefer the XX to X time frame, which is safer"" [Customer] ""Um, I will be there the 3rd at 7:30 in the morning."" [Agent] ""So would you prefer the X to XX or XX to X so I can work on that for you."" [Customer] ""I would have I would love the X to XX. That sounds outstanding."" [Agent] ""Alrighty so I am going to go ahead and work on getting that X to XX for you. Let me provide you the account number and you will be um good to go on this end."" [Customer] ""OK, hold on one minute. Let me grab my pencil."" [Agent] ""Thank you."" [Customer] ""OK, what is it?"" [Agent] ""OK, so on XXXX, we are going to install services at account number XXX. XX XXXXXX-XX, you want me to reiterate that for you? I will be happy to do so."" [Customer] ""I, I, I am going to read it back to you."" [Agent] ""Perfect. Go right ahead."" [Customer] ""X XXX XX-XXXX XX-XX"" [Agent] ""Perfect, thank you. Within that you will find the um lot of numbers. I can not tell you what order they are in, but I am sure they are there somewhere. Um, that is going to go ahead and include your gig speed of service with your phone number, your modem, and your router. I would like to go ahead and just advise you that at this time we can offer you our premier technical support as well just in case you need any assistance with networking any of your devices or phones or anything, maybe even your cell phone. Um, normally that is $30 but right now as a valued customer you would get it for $20. Um, any trouble calls that you may have that would not be billed out to you. Normally trouble calls are $80 but you would not get, um, that billed out to you either. They would just be included within the um $165 for the services, and that would include your modem, your router, your gig speed of service, and your premier technical support. Let me know if you would like to take advantage of that promotion that we have going on for our valued customers."" [Customer] ""Um, not right now, thank you."" [Agent] ""OK, and if you ever want to add it on at a later time, you can. It would just be at the $30 charge, but you can add that at any point. Can I ask you, please, as well, what it is that you are doing for cellular service at this time?"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Which phone company do you have?"" [Customer] ""I have, I have Verizon."" [Agent] ""OK, uh, were you aware that Optimum provides cellular service by any chance?"" [Customer] ""but I have I have been with Verizon for years, so I am just going to stick with Verizon"" [Agent] ""I understand and I thank you so much for the loyalty. That is, you know, I am glad that you are doing that because that is how we get to go ahead and keep you as a valued customer when you are moving. But just keep in mind that the way that we price out our services, we could go ahead and provide you an unlimited line. The pricing structure is $47 when you go ahead and do that unlimited line, we give you $40 off on your internet service So unless Verizon is charging you less than $7 a month for your self service, this may not be such a bad idea."" [Customer] ""Not right now thank you."" [Agent] ""Not a problem. Well, uh, your appointment, um, is good to go. It is being processed at this time. Um, you are going to be on this phone number XXX-XXX-XXXX for the next XX minutes, hour or so."" [Customer] ""Yes, ma'am.""

You are good to go. I am working on your order I want to say thank you so much for your time, your patience, and for allowing me to assist Any other questions or concerns that I can help you out with you, um, at this time?""

[Agent] ""Yeah, that is, that is why I say they, um, they are very, very good with that. If like they, they are about the customers a good experience, they will, they will definitely extend you, especially if you pay on time, you know, if you, you, you know, you do not pay X or X times, I am they will still work with you or maybe not as much, but they are, they are very good working with customers."" [Customer] ""Oh yeah. OK, well, let us do, so what do I get for the XX a month?"" [Agent] ""You are getting to the um, I was able to able to get to the same XXX speed So it is the XXX speed on that and then. Uh, let us see here."" [Customer] ""And that is the lowest you guys have, you do not have anything lower."" [Agent] ""No, no, we do not, we do not do anything lower, yeah."" [Customer] ""OK, well, let us do that.""

[Agent] ""I love"" [Customer] ""And so will they give me any type of more heads up I just need to be ready between Friday and XX"" [Agent] ""Yes, they are going to call that that is so just I will recap everything for you. So you are getting the $300 internet on on the combat pricing. So it is going to be $55 a month. It will go down to $50 with auto pay. So one time installation fee of $100 rolled into the bill. The tech is coming XX to X Friday the 30th, about XX minutes half an hour before arrival. They will call XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Customer] ""Oh hold on, hold on, I was double checking. I thought my tenant is checking in the 30th, but they are not, they are coming in on the 29th. Is there any way I can change the installation date?"" [Agent] ""Well, what I will have to do, I will put this in and then I have to put in something called a sooner request because this is the soonest it is showing me since we are not doing phones it is probably a good chance I could move it up."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So, uh, I have to book the 30th."" [Customer] ""Or I mean later is fine too. If we need go later that is OK too."" [Agent] ""Yeah Yeah, I have XX to X that day, so I will just book that day and then I will put in the request to see if they can come sooner."" [Customer] ""I will just let him know.

Call228,"[Agent] ""Thank you for choosing Optimum Business. Now offering Optimum Mobile. This is Lizzie. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking to?"" [Customer] ""Hey, listen, how is your name is Joe."" [Agent] ""Hey Joe, it is doing good. How are you?"" [Customer] ""Doing good."" [Agent] ""How can I help you?"" [Customer] ""Yes, I was looking to see I just got transferred over here I was seeing if, uh, I was able to get internet in my area for my commercial business."" [Agent] ""OK, and what is the address of your commercial business?"" [Customer] ""Yes, it is uh XXX North Third Street in Maybank, Texas. ZIP code XXXXX."" [Agent] ""And what type of business do you have?"" [Customer] ""It is a Shell gas station a Church's Chicken in one"" [Agent] ""Oh, OK. Let us see."" [Customer] ""I hope you do because right now we are on DSL with Bright speed uh I just took over this business I do not know like X or X months ago we are paying like almost $1000 a month It is ridiculous."" [Agent] ""Oh my goodness, for what speed?"" [Customer] ""for, yeah, exactly, for like, uh, probably like XX down, X up, but it is DSL and it is like the only provider in this rural town I guess. I do not know, but I thought maybe Optimum could be available, so I am just hoping, I am hoping there is something that could happen."" [Agent] ""Yeah, I am checking my serviceability tracker now."" [Customer] ""That'd be understandable if we were like that I do not know. A million down for that price."" [Agent] ""So from what I see, I mean it looks like our lines are right there um the best thing I would recommend is I mean we can go ahead and get you set up with an account just before installation let us do a serviceability check to make sure that it is serviceable."" [Customer] ""Now I, I did this at my other location in Segaville, Texas about a month or two ago, and you know they are trying to follow up on these chain emails. Uh, like, let me see here, because I pretty much I think what you are, what you are saying is."" [Agent] ""Now I mean on my footprint it shows our lines going straight to the gas station, um, and then it shows everything next to you is serviceable, everything like the building behind you got services you are literally right on the cusp of where our services stop."" [Customer] ""Yeah, oK, you, are you able to open another tab of a of a WF maybe? Does that mean work something? WF I do not know I have a number"" [Agent] ""Let me see."" [Customer] ""Um, I do not know if that means like workforce or work. I do not know something maybe a work order"" [Agent] ""It is called WorkFront."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And give me one second."" [Customer] ""I guess now that I now that I have you on the phone I am very curious what is going on with the one in Segaville. Because right there we are on DSL as well with ACC, uh, the number is XXX-XXX-XX."" [Agent] ""What is that work for order? Is that for XXX East Molly Mall?"" [Customer] ""Uh, Malloy Bridge Road, yeah, in, uh, Seville."" [Agent] ""OK. Mhm mhm. So this one looks like it is in progress. It is only completed about 20% so far, um, but it looks like we are getting the lines out to you. Have you not heard from them?"" [Customer] ""Nothing yet. There was uh William Green that followed up on Monday with an email saying, hi Sandra can you please provide an update But uh I guess Sandra never updated on where we are at with that one. I guess he is the manager of channel sales. William Green. Um,"" [Agent] ""Is this should"" [Customer] ""But I guess yeah the store about sorry go ahead."" [Agent] ""Is this your best contact number you are calling from?"" [Customer] ""Yes it is."" [Agent] ""OK, and what is your email?"" [Customer] ""Uh, email is uh. Should I give you the email of what the new account would be or just for this account at Segaville?"" [Agent] ""What is just going to be your best contact email?"" [Customer] ""Uh, just do, uh. Yes we will put it together. Do you seegaville Market at hotmail.com."" [Agent] ""OK, and spell your first and last name for me?"" [Customer] ""Uh first name Joe, last name Kalui, K H A L O U S I."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""So pretty much I am trying to compare and see if we are going to go through the same thing that I have been dealing with for this location. I do not know hopefully we can get it quick."" [Agent] ""So let me, yeah. She is a is a little bit different, but I went ahead and tagged Sandra in that so maybe she will see all these notices that we are reaching out to her, but this one was XXX East New. Mm, I see now. OK, well I mean we would do the serviceability check beforehand to let you know um so I am, so, uh, but to do a serviceability check, of course we have to do like we have to set up like a scheduled installation and then we push that out for about a week or two and then we do the SRO to see because this location's kind of the same way it looks like it should have services but you are you are saying we we do not."" [Customer] ""OK. Yeah."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""Um, yeah, I guess I mean in order to do the check and everything we got to go ahead and go with the sales order."" [Agent] ""Mhm, yes."" [Customer] ""OK, um."" [Agent] ""Because you are not locked into anything if we go in we show that oh it is not available we cancel everything out and we, we say hey do you want to start a construction order? If you do not want to start a construction order you can stay with who you have now. But I mean from what I am seeing on my actual maps, it looks like the the lines go straight to you."" [Customer] ""OK, yeah. Um, yeah, cause I mean, that would be a waiting thing. I mean, the only other person that has internet, like cable co access is like Spectrum. I have not called them yet, but Um, But if I am going to do internet in Seville eventually with Optimum, I, I might as well do it here as well since they are like XX minutes away from each other location wise."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Um, yeah, I guess let us go ahead, we will do a, we will do a work order or a sales order for that. That is fine."" [Agent] ""OK, and what is going to be the business's name here?"" [Customer] ""going to be Gateway X."" [Agent] ""OK. And this is your best contact number?"" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""And what is the email for this one?"" [Customer] ""going to be a gateway shell. X At outlook.com."" [Agent] ""And what is the tax ID for this one?"" [Customer] ""Uh, let me pull that up, give me one second."" [Agent] ""While you are getting that joke, can I reach over to my support team real fast?"" [Customer] ""Sure, no problem."" [Agent] ""Thank you."" [Customer] ""Right Calling sales enablement, this is Marsha. How may I help you?"" [Agent] ""Hey Marsha, this is Lizzie operator at EXX V as in Victor."" [Customer] ""Hey Lizzy, how can I help you?"" [Agent] ""Hey, I have got an account that I just need a tag removed off of."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""It is XXXXX. XX,XXX,XXX"" [Customer] ""OK, XXX North Third Street in May."" [Agent] ""Yes ma'am."" [Customer] ""OK, that non-service tag has been removed."" [Agent] ""Awesome thank you."" [Customer] ""You are welcome have a great day."" [Agent] ""You too bye."" [Customer] ""Bye."" [Agent] ""OK, and were you able to find that tax ID number?"" [Customer] ""Uh yeah."" [Agent] ""OK, I am ready."" [Customer] ""It is XXXXXXXXX."" [Agent] ""Thank you. And for the business I know we spoke about internet are we also needing landlines and TV services"" [Customer] ""Um, Let us hold off on the landline for now."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""I know it is probably better if I do that. You probably get me a better deal, but everything with this phone number right now is all connected to the Church's chicken and the pizza that we have in the store."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Oh OK."" [Customer] ""And I just kinda want to, want to do it right, so yeah, maybe maybe we will hold off just right now."" [Agent] ""OK, what about mobile line or yeah, mobile lines bundling instead of landlines."" [Customer] ""I know No, no, that is OK. I appreciate that though."" [Agent] ""OK, and then what would be a good X digit access code for this account?"" [Customer] ""Uh, let us do XXXX."" [Agent] ""OK. See And then with you being a like a big gas station where you are doing like the church's chicken and pizza you have got quite a few devices connected, right?"" [Customer] ""Um, we, we do, yes, yes."" [Agent] ""OK, so I would probably recommend something like our X gig intern internet. See, we are a non-contract company. We do offer a X year price guarantee associated with our X gig internet. It is going to include the X gig Internet, um, a product that is called our Premier technical support. So if you ever have any basic IT issues we are able to assist you as well as what is called a connection back up, um, so if you ever have any like power outages or even internet outages this turns on automatically to support your Internet services."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Let us see, I am getting everything pulled up."" [Customer] ""Awesome."" [Agent] ""It is a really great device that we have been, we just rolled it out at the beginning of the year and it is, it is really good."" [Customer] ""I like that for sure."" [Agent] ""Yeah Oh OK."" [Customer] ""I know right now like how we have the internet set up here we have this company Bright Speed, but then the Church's Chicken, uh, they have their own backup internet, uh, if anything does go down, but it is good to get like a, like a double backup is good, especially for the gas station part to get a backup for the gas station is good as well."" [Agent] ""Yeah Let us see."" [Customer] ""Because the internet goes out here with the gas station, our credit cards and debit cards do not work."" [Agent] ""And that is really what this is for is like if you are like your point of sale machine."" [Customer] ""Yeah Yeah."" [Agent] ""That is what it is best for."" [Customer] ""Yeah"" [Agent] ""Mm I am just getting all my codes on here for you and getting it all pulled up."" [Customer] ""here is what I am worried about though. Like, I will be honest, so far in X months we have had no issues internet wise here, even though it is like I am running on the worst, most expensive internet."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""I just hope that the transition and everything, we are not going to have any issues and like everything will be working exactly how it is."" [Agent] ""Mm. Yeah, so the transition with moving over to another provider, you do not have to immediately connect to Brie. You can always like set up our services, see how they work for you. Um, we do offer a, uh, XX day money back guarantee so if anything does ever happen, you can always give us a call and we can assist you with that as well as we are not a contract."" [Customer] ""Yeah. Yeah."" [Agent] ""You are not locked in anything with us. It is, hey, we have to work every day to provide you services if we do not, you can easily drop us"" [Customer] ""Yeah. Got you, got you."" [Agent] ""And then Uh, I know we are doing a serviceability check for this location to make sure that it is serviceable are we wanting to set up auto pay today as well"" [Customer] ""Good to know. Uh, yes, we can, that is fine."" [Agent] ""OK, OK, just making sure that discounts on there. And then it looks like right now with everything that we are able to offer with the X gig internet we can actually offer that just at $170 monthly and then a one time installation of $100 that goes on the first month's bill."" [Customer] ""Awesome, I like that."" [Agent] ""OK, and then let me get over to my schedule. Like I said, I do want to go ahead and just schedule this out about a week and then do that serviceability check."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, for sure."" [Agent] ""OK, bear with me. And just going back to the mobile just because it is such, such a great deal with our X gig, if you do ever want to even set up like a personal phone under your business, you would, when bundling with our X gig receive up to a $40 discount. So that would bring it down to about $130 monthly. The cell phone charges are about $47 monthly and so it is pretty much a wash with the two."" [Customer] ""That is good to know, but no, that is OK. I appreciate it. Thank you though."" [Agent] ""Of course, and then it looks like about a week out is the 29th, so I am going to schedule that for installation. It is an XX to X appointment. Are you going to be available at that time?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, XXXX, that is perfect."" [Agent] ""OK, and then this is your best contact number?"" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""OK. And then do you have that card or bank account you wanted to use for the auto pay?"" [Customer] ""Uh, yes, I have the, uh, bank account number and routing number."" [Agent] ""OK, is it going to be under Gateway X?"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Awesome, OK."" [Customer] ""I do not know if I need to. I do not need to give you a corporate name or anything, right, because the corporate name is Harvey's Gateway X LLC, but I do not know if that matters."" [Agent] ""No. No, it does not."" [Customer] ""OK, OK, I am ready whenever you are."" [Agent] ""OK, I am ready for routing first, please."" [Customer] ""OK, it is XXX. XXX. XXX."" [Agent] ""Was that X ones at the beginning or X?"" [Customer] ""Uh, X."" [Agent] ""Awesome and then the account number?"" [Customer] ""XXX. XXX XXX X."" [Agent] ""OK, and then we are just setting up auto pay. We are not taking anything from you today and if it becomes, if it shows that it is not serviceable, all of this will be canceled and your autopay will not be ever used."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I think it is the same thing that I have to speak about. I do not, I did not get charged for anything yet and they are still working on it."" [Agent] ""Yeah, we do not charge until you actually use our services then we do not even charge you until XX days after you started using our services, so, um"" [Customer] ""OK, cool."" [Agent] ""And then OK let us see that SRO when we can do that. OK, I am going to do the SRO as soon as, uh, tomorrow."" [Customer] ""OK, perfect."" [Agent] ""Today's the 22nd, yeah, so tomorrow it is an all day appointment, so you might just see the trucks out there. They do not normally need you to be there, but if we do, we will reach out to you on the phone number we have on the account, um, let us see, and then that will tell us if we are able to service it, if it, if we are not able to service it, um, I will reach back out to you on Monday and let you know."" [Customer] ""OK. OK, perfect, I appreciate it."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""And you said you put a little little note for Sandra to get back to me at the location."" [Agent] ""Yes, the other one, the Segovi, yes sir, I put in a notification to ask her to reach out to you."" [Customer] ""Or OK OK awesome."" [Agent] ""Um, normally customers hear back within about XX to XX to XX hours."" [Customer] ""Alrighty, I appreciate all your help today thank you so much."" [Agent] ""Yeah, Joe, thank you for giving them a call and you have a great day."" [Customer] ""Thank you you too bye bye."" [Agent] ""Oh my God."""

[Agent] ""OK, because we teamed up with T-Mobile with our network as well, so if you bundle um a mobile line we can give you additional discounts as well."" [Customer] ""OK, if you want to give me all that information, um, I can definitely get with my husband on it."" [Agent] ""Absolutely, yeah, that is it. Like I said, no contracts, prices are good for, you know X years on the XXX and the gigs So let me get you set up on everything I could do here. I am going to put in the newest promo I have.

I am going to punch in the promo I will be right back with you If for some reason we are disconnected, I will call you right back at the XXXX number you gave me."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""A few moments please."" [Customer] ""Thank you."" [Agent] ""Hi are you still with me?"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""OK, alright, so the XXX speed internet is $95 a month. It would go down to $90 with autopay. And then that is also if you bundle the mobile line or a tablet we can give you a $20 discount on that as well."" [Customer] ""OK, so it is XX just for the internet."" [Agent] ""Yeah, that is for the XXX internet."" [Customer] ""Um,"" [Agent] ""The gig is the fastest, but from what you are telling me it it does not sound like that is what you need."" [Customer] ""Do you have any smaller packages than the XXX?"" [Agent] ""We do have a XXX. On the XXX is XX."" [Customer] ""And then um how much would it be with the XXX and a cell phone?"" [Agent] ""So if you get $300 and you bundle a line I can give you a $15 discount on that."" [Customer] ""OK, so how much would that be?"" [Agent] ""So then you would be well it is well it is XX minus X if you do the auto pay, then another XX from there so that would bring you down to XX."" [Customer] ""So XX minus the XX? OK. Um,"" [Agent] ""And then whatever plan you pick, you know, we, if you have a, you know, if you want to use it for a main line, you know what, and you just keep it, it is connected to Wi Fi, I mean we have plans that are as low as $15. All unlimited talk and text."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And you do not have to buy a new phone. You can bring a device if it is compatible. It is not, you know, XXX years old, it will be fine."" [Customer] ""Yeah. Um, and then do you guys have any kind of installation fees?"" [Agent] ""There is a one-time installation fee of $100 that is rolled into the bill. And that is it. And again all of this is no contracts, you know, as if you guys wind up going viral say, listen, I need to upgrade or streaming out of here, you know, I need X cell phones You, you could do all of that no penalties, nothing"" [Customer] ""OK, can you tell me what all comes on the lowest cell phone package?"" [Agent] ""Alright, so the lowest cell phone package, it is unlimited talking text, but what it has is just X gig of premium data."" [Customer] ""You said unlimited talk and text."" [Agent] ""So if you are like if you are roaming a lot, you know, it is not really the best. The most popular package is the unlimited plan, uh which is the $45 plan Now that one is unlimited talk and text like all the others, but that got XXGB of premium, premium data along with XGB of mobile hotspot, um, and that if you bundle two lines, those go down to $30 a piece."" [Customer] ""No it is X it would be XX and XX."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""For internet and phone. OK."" [Agent] ""That that is, and that is again, you know, if you choose to finance a new phone, then obviously you know you have to put in the cost of whatever you are financing or if you are bringing the device then obviously there is no uh because and then again those are all no contracts, you know what I mean if you could make any adjustments you need to and very, very friendly."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Like I can have someone there as soon as tomorrow for the installation for the Internet."" [Customer] ""Mm. OK, and this is the lowest um packages that y'all would have for this."" [Agent] ""Yeah, um, that is, that is the lowest for the XXX because honestly with, with the amount of bandwidth, you know, devices are pulling, you know what I mean, that is XXX gets used up pretty quick, you know, uh, are you going to allow people to connect to the, uh, the Wi Fi there or no?"" [Customer] ""No."" [Agent] ""OK good alright so then you should not have any problems you know with with things like that."" [Customer] ""Mm. OK, oK, well let me visit with my husband and see which one he wants to do and um if he wants to switch the cell phone over or not and I will."" [Agent] ""OK. Yeah, well, that you could do after X, so that is no problem. What I could do, let me, let me check because if the best way to do this is this if I put you in for an install, we do not have to do tomorrow."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""I could pick a day next week. That is no problem, but at least that way you will get an email directly from Optimum, and it will be outlining everything so you could see exactly, you know, the whole order and then I will be a direct point of contact. I am going to email you. Did, did I already email you or not? No, I am going to email you. Do you have access to your email now?"" [Customer] ""Um, I will hear in a little bit, not right right now though."" [Agent] ""OK, alright, so I am going to email you now just so I know you have my contact because then it would be a lot easier than uh calling in doing anything else."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And Now, on the day of install is it best for the technical your number?"" [Customer] ""Uh yes."" [Agent] ""Alright, alright, so what I am going to do, I am just send you an email so you know you have it it is done. And then you could get me any time on that because I do not have a direct line unfortunately."" [Customer] ""So would I just reply back to that email?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, reply to the, yeah, because what I am going to do."" [Customer] ""Like if we wanted to do this or change the date or."" [Agent] ""Yeah, because if you want to change anything, if you want to upgrade it, that is fine. So what if what we should do is we should pick a day next week just so we have you in the calendar and then it is a lot easier to make things change and you could simply email me. I have all day Wednesday the 28th. I have X to XXXX to X, and X to X."" [Customer] ""OK, are you all closed on Monday? Would that be in a holiday."" [Agent] ""Uh, do not see any. I have Tuesday, yeah, Monday. I, I do not see anyone active I do have Tuesday as well, uh, XX to X and X to X."" [Customer] ""OK. Um, I will have to figure out who can go up there, um."" [Agent] ""I just just needs to be someone to give them access, you know, over XX, you know, it, it should be a relatively easy install as well."" [Customer] ""OK. Mm."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so, so you want to put in for Tuesday the X to X so we can hold that spot?"" [Customer] ""Well, we have class at 4:30 and I do not know what he would need to do that."" [Agent] ""Well, do you"" [Customer] ""So."" [Agent] ""Well, that is what I am saying we could easily uh move things around like I said is the mornings better?"" [Customer] ""I just, I do not, I have to schedule with my husband because I mean we both work full time so we would one of us would have to take off to be there for this so let me just call back once I I talked to him and get a time down and then I can schedule it then."" [Agent] ""Yeah That is all. Yeah, or OK, alright then, this is what well I will, I am just going to hold the spot because otherwise we will have to generate everything all over again and I do not, I feel bad that you spend as much time on the phone"" [Customer] ""Yeah. OK."" [Agent] ""It is in XX minutes, uh, so what I will do I will just put you in for Friday, the 30th I will just put the X to XX spot just to hold it so at least we have everything in, gives us plenty of time if you want to move it up, easily done, just email me I will move everything up"" [Customer] ""OK, and if we do not want to do it then what do I need to do?"" [Agent] ""Then I it I can simply cancel it."" [Customer] ""OK, alright, I will wait for the email and reply to that once we."" [Agent] ""Alright, you are not obligated to anything, so. Yep, so I will just recap it just so we are I will just recap everything so we are on the same page"" [Customer] ""Once we figure it out."" [Agent] ""You get the XXX internet speed. It is $75 a month. It would go down to $70 with auto pay one time installation fee of $100 rolled into the bill. The tech right now we are holding the spot for May 30th, which is a Friday, the X to XX, and if that is the date we choose, the tech's going to call XXX-XXX-XXXX half an hour before arrival.""

Now as far as uh things go uh there is no installation associated with it. We are going to be able to set this up. I just wanted to make sure on your end, uh, that you did not need like an upgrade for your Internet or or anything else."" [Customer] ""No, no, no.""

[Customer] ""You said it it goes up XX or XX?"" [Agent] ""$1515 and I am sorry if I, if I um you already have like the best promotion that you can have so it is only an increase of $15."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK, no, no, no, I just want to make. OK perfect."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so yeah, so there is other people they are looking at a lot more than that I am sorry if I said XX, I only said XXXX I meant to say XXXX."" [Customer] ""No, I think you said it was just like in on the I I was surprised on how little um every, every call usually does not go like that small a little"" [Agent] ""Yeah, it does does not, but because you guys were put into a promo, I just was able to extend it so you guys are, you guys are good to go."" [Customer] ""OK perfect."" [Agent] ""You got it. So I just want to confirm this is for uh for a Community Access LTD XXX Morris Ave, J and Elizabeth, New Jersey XXXXX.

[Agent] ""Yeah, sure. What is that work email? I will get something over. I understand when people are in a family bundle it usually works out pretty much for them, and you definitely do not want to break that up, but if we have some business options that, uh, you know, that seem attractive to you, we can get that over. So yeah, what is that email?"" [Customer] ""It would be J And then A Z E V E D O. At CUNJ.org."" [Agent] ""OK, so I am going to read that back. That is J A Z E V E D O and just to make sure that O is O as in Oscar, not X, right?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, O as in Oscar."" [Agent] ""Perfect, and that is at CAUNJ.org."" [Customer] ""Yeah, correct.""

Call231,"[Agent] ""Thank you for calling O and Business. This is Jared speaking. How can I help you?"" [Customer] ""Hi, Jared."" [Agent] ""Hi, my name is Julia."" [Customer] ""My name is Julia. Um, we want to add"" [Agent] ""Um, we went to."" [Customer] ""X internet access points. On our property on our under our same account and I just wanted to get a little bit more information um the maintenance manager had called somebody to get preliminary information and I just wanted to confirm some of it and also he was told we would have to open a new account for these two new access points that we want and I just was wondering why we can not put it all under the same account that we have with you."" [Agent] ""Well, uh, just a couple things and I will get to all of it, and Julie, if for some reason we get connected, what is the best number to reach you back?"" [Customer] ""OK. XXX XXX XXXX"" [Agent] ""OK, and is this for XXXX Industrial Drive?"" [Customer] ""Yes, it is."" [Agent] ""OK, OK, so now, uh, uh, just to get to a couple of the points."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So the different points, are they in different buildings or are they all in the same building?"" [Customer] ""Um, different buildings because it is a self storage, um, property."" [Agent] ""OK. OK. OK, now, now there is the second part which is the part you are really going to like since they are all going to be separate building, they would get their own accounts, so that means you would also get new pricing on all of them if you did them all under one, it would be a separate connection so you would have to pay uh for that so the multiple connections so this would probably save you upwards like $300 a month."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So this cost even though it, even though yes it might, I can understand it might be slightly inconvenient because they are multiple accounts, uh, dollars and cents wise it makes sense."" [Customer] ""Um, to OK, and again, since um. Let us see, we, we need X. Internet access points, is that the correct terminology?"" [Agent] ""Well, they are, they are connections, yeah, they are not an an access point is a little different, so they would be separate connections so like each building would get their own."" [Customer] ""Connection, yes. OK. Um, So would each of those new connections be Um a separate account, so instead of having my one original account now I will have X accounts"" [Agent] ""Yes, and like I said, even though it does seem inconvenient, it will be cost effective because the way it is, it, uh, if you are if you are doing X connections under the same account, so you would have X, it would be."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""That is right the way that this is the way the system allows it, it would, it would, it would triple your bill like I it would bring everything up, yeah, so I mean that, so that is what I am saying even dollars and cents wise it, it completely makes sense, uh, because you have now on this other one here I, I."" [Customer] ""OK, that is all I need to know. OK. OK."" [Agent] ""XX OK. Do you have the, uh, let me get back to this. How big is this building?"" [Customer] ""Oh, I do not have any idea."" [Agent] ""Roughly, is it a large not an office is this, this first connection, is this just for the office or is it for a whole building?"" [Customer] ""Um, it is for the. Uh, it is for the office."" [Agent] ""OK, alright, and do you have the X digit access code that is on the account?"" [Customer] ""Yes, I do. It is XXXX."" [Agent] ""Excellent. OK, now because you you do have a very for this one you have a very like entry level speed very outdated um, I do not normally see the XXX speed anymore, um So but that that is fine you know we can upgrade this one, get this one up to snuff, and then set up the new ones you will get new pricing, new promo pricing on the other buildings now are they like, uh, the other buildings they are separated, are they like front are they back? how would you, uh, describe them?"" [Customer] ""Well, they are, well, it is a, it is a self storage place, so there is rows of the storage and so um this one of them is going in a records room type thing."" [Agent] ""OK Yeah"" [Customer] ""It is one of the storage places and so it is going to go in there then the other one is going in the um Uh, we have a residence on site, so it will go in that house type building."" [Agent] ""Excellent. OK, so, so that thank you. That actually usually the hardest thing is to uh figure out how to label them that, you know, that we are dividing them up. So that is perfect. So alright, so what we are going to do is I have to get my sales enablement team real quick, but first."" [Customer] ""OK. Well, and I am not ordering it right now, Jared. I am just getting information to give to the owner."" [Agent] ""Yeah, no, we, we basically, the way, the way I would do it right, is we would set it up I could set this install up for a month from now"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""It does not matter at least this way you can get all of the info I can get the account generated because right now there is only that one account I will have to generate the other two, right for the, the record for the record room and the the uh the residents on there so we have that we could be ahead of the game so when you get back"" [Customer] ""OK. OK. But what if we decide not to go this route?"" [Agent] ""You can simply cancel. There is no contract that that you are not bound to anything."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Uh, it is about customer service. You are, we make sure you have a good customer experience. We are not bound to anything no contracts Everything's month to month, but either way this will save the time because we have to generate the, uh, the accounts anyways, so."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So this way No, no, no, you do not, you do not get charged anything until after there is an installation."" [Customer] ""I will not be charged anything, billed anything. OK."" [Agent] ""That is it, and even that is bill, nothing's out of pocket, right?"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So I am going to, I am going to put in the, let me put the serviceability ticket in while I got you here."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Alright then then we will we will do the ticket and so they could generate the address and that is the way to go. Julia, can you spell your last name for me please?"" [Customer] ""Moore, M XX R E."" [Agent] ""Not easy enough and the XXX-XXX-XXXX that is your cell."" [Customer] ""XXXXX"" [Agent] ""Alright, that is just some poor handwriting on my part. I apologize. XXX-X. OK, alright, and the zip code there again was?"" [Customer] ""Um, up in Flagstaff is XXXXX."" [Agent] ""XXXXX there we go, yeah, I, Arizona. I have been to LA I have been to uh Vegas. I have not in Arizona yet. That is high on my list."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""I want to get to, uh. I want to get to Sedona. I hear Sedona's, you know, beautiful and Jerome and everything over there. Got to get to that."" [Customer] ""Yeah, just do not come in the summer."" [Agent] ""I, I, you know, I, I I said that to someone else They are like, oh, you know, it is not. I am like, listen, dry heat or not, XXX whatever XXXX is XXX I do not care what you say. That, that is crazy. I can not believe that is real."" [Customer] ""Yes it is."" [Agent] ""And but then some of the parts that are elevated, they are, they are not as bad. Is that what it is?"" [Customer] ""Right, yeah. Flagstaff does not get that as hot. White Mountains does not get that hot, so."" [Agent] ""OK, alright, see."" [Customer] ""It is doable. There is places you can live and survive."" [Agent] ""Alright good that is what I am right good I am learning here because I am."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""Yeah, alright, so"" [Customer] ""Now Jared, I am going to go backtrack again um. We are not and I know you just want to get us in the system, but we are not I am not positive that we are moving forward in this direction so I just do not I question even setting something up right now"" [Agent] ""I, I understand, and that is what I am saying, but this way, I mean it, it is, it is the easiest way to go and then you can have something solid to, you know, to show your, uh, you know, your boss or whoever else has to make the final decision."" [Customer] ""OK. OK. OK. OK, and then back to our original account when you said our speed is XXX. I am showing on our bill and I am not a tech person it is XXX/XX MP."" [Agent] ""You got Yeah, no, it is XXX, yeah, that is what I am saying. I said I have not, I have not seen lower than XXX."" [Customer] ""OK. XX, OK."" [Agent] ""Yeah, yeah, so you are actually the lowest I have seen in ages, so we can upgrade this one, bring this one up to snuff, OK, so you will be getting a lot more bang for your buck on this one and then the other two will be set up on new promo pricing, um, which those, I mean, will be."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Uh, I mean those will probably be in the XXX range, um, each, so I mean they will they will even be less on this one."" [Customer] ""OK. OK, yeah because um our maintenance manager got a different price so I am anxious to hear what what it is going to be."" [Agent] ""So like I said those are the. Those Well how much did they offer you on the price?"" [Customer] ""Well, he was quoted XXX, but if you can come in lower, obviously that would be better for, and for X gig of internet speed."" [Agent] ""Yeah, well, well, that is is that with phone? Yeah, this is one gig of internet as well was was that also a phone? Because I just that is the internet."" [Customer] ""No, it is just"" [Agent] ""Yeah, so the"" [Customer] ""Yeah, what these are is these are um. My, the owner reports to them as internet access points or connections."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Um, we are putting in a big camera system so we need the Wi Fi to be able to carry to, throughout the whole property"" [Agent] ""Uh huh Absolutely. Well, this, this will ensure that this will be able to make sure that room is covered."" [Customer] ""OK, oK.""

[Agent] ""Alright, so I am going to get my enablement team just to generate the address and then I am going to come right back to you, conference you in just so you can verify that you know one's going to be the record room or and one's going to be the residence, right?

The residence, yep. Yes ma'am. Where is that going to be located? Like is it in the back of this building, I mean of the property or? Um, uh. That I, I, I am not sure. I am not the right person to I am down in Scottsdale at the home office so I am not up here"" [Agent] ""Mm We can do that one later if that is easy both at once we could, we could do the rec room now and then do the other one later if that if that is easiest."" [Customer] ""I can um. So I do not No, I, I, if I want to do it all at once, so this may not be a good time."" [Agent] ""Absolutely."" [Customer] ""I may need to get um call up there to get location since this is um information you need so you need the location for the records room and the location for the."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""We just want to know what the the resy property is on the um on the building that way we can set it up for you."" [Agent] ""Yeah, it is like it is like basically they need to be labeled like you uh to the left or or but you know that type of thing you know they just need a way to differentiate you know, where the connection's going to be"" [Customer] ""Well, I have no idea so I am going to have to um. I am going to have to call up there and find out, so I am going to be, I need to ask them specifically where in the residence the this is going to be."" [Agent] ""Oh No, where is the residence adjacent to the building? Like the like is it to the left of the storage facility? Is it to the right?"" [Customer] ""No, it is, it is within it the the whole storage facility um is a big property and the resident is among that so is the office."" [Agent] ""That Mhm."" [Customer] ""So it is all together, it is not, it is not separated."" [Agent] ""OK And so yeah, we just need to know and that is that is what we are trying to figure out just the proper way to label it."" [Customer] ""I am not sure how to answer that. Well, when you the entrance to the property, you have the um. The main office I see that um. So the office is XXXX East Industrial, the residence is XXXX East Ind Industrial. Does that help? OK. So the X. The residence is here they are wanting to because I see that at XXXX is for a customer here we have an active account for the residential services. Right, but this is, this is something different. This is the, the manager of this, uh, um, self storage lives on site, so that is her residence, so she has her own personal for her own internet we need another connection at this residence site in order to be able to connect all of our cameras around the property"" [Agent] ""OK. Actually I think I might have a I think I might have a suggestion that might work for this if we do just the rec room you might just need static IP for the cameras"" [Customer] ""Well this is all for the cameras. This, this the whole reason why we need these two connections added to these accounts is to be able to install this new camera system."" [Agent] ""Yeah Mhm."" [Customer] ""Mm"" [Agent] ""OK Kayla, how would you suggest we just uh for the labeling?"" [Customer] ""Well, the only thing that is making this one is a little different is because the, the XXXX, yeah, mhm."" [Agent] ""There is a residential already there. OK, so, so basically we would, we could set up the one for the rec room, OK, and then the, the residential."" [Customer] ""And when you say rec room, this is a records room. It is just this one of the storage it is one of the storage units."" [Agent] ""Records, that is what I am saying records. I am, yeah, I am, I am sorry, I am just abbreviate the records room."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so we could do"" [Customer] ""I just did not want you to think it was a gym or some, you know, conference room, which is, it is one of the storage storage units."" [Agent] ""I got you. Yeah, I, I would suggest we do that because otherwise because the only way to do it at the residence we would have to speak with them and then set up a separate business connection they would have to give the OK so that that is actually a separate thing."" [Customer] ""Well, hold on, hold on really quick Jared. Let me look at something else really quick here because I am not sure if they have like that looks like more more than one part of the storage and then the one that I am looking at it says self storage technically it is labeled XXXX so it looks like it is different from."" [Agent] ""Sure."" [Customer] ""The first one that I did build um."" [Agent] ""Mhm. So the other one's a different address."" [Customer] ""Yeah, and there is, it is not actually uh now that I am I am looking at the property there is no actual. House label, you know that the whole thing is labeled this."" [Agent] ""Yeah"" [Customer] ""So I feel like we we can be OK with this one, I will just put it in as commercial."" [Agent] ""OK OK."" [Customer] ""Because if you look on the outside of the building and they are labeled with two different addresses here. If that makes sense."" [Agent] ""What you said?"" [Customer] ""Kayla, are you looking at a map of the property? Yes, ma'am. I am looking on Google Maps. OK, OK, so you can see where the office is? Um, OK, and then to the right of that. Um, is the resident and office and then that Vicky Street, if you go down that street halfway through that, um, block of storage buildings there, the one, the row that is facing Vicky Street about midway is where we want that 3rd. Um, connection. Yes ma'am, so when our techs go out, um, do you have like an IT guy or something of that sort. We have a maintenance manager which he would work with them. He will be on site?"" [Agent] ""OK Excellent."" [Customer] ""OK, yeah, I would just put a number that way he can work with the the tech as far as because I I do understand what you said I see everything here just so there is no confusion with the text I will put a number so he can call and actually speak with Yeah, he definitely needs to be present when the techs are on site. Yes."" [Agent] ""So we will make sure we set this up and we will, we will get it all going so everyone could, uh, coincide, you know, get in touch with each other, make sure everyone's on the same page. It is the best way to do it."" [Customer] ""Yes, yeah, OK, so for this one. Here for the XXXX you can use this account. Let me know when you are ready for that one, J."" [Agent] ""I am ready."" [Customer] ""Alrighty, that was going to be XXXXX. XXX XXX"" [Agent] ""XXX awesome alright I will set these both up Thank you very much, Kayla. I appreciate your time."" [Customer] ""No problem. Thanks Taylor. You are welcome appreciate it. Have a good night. You too bye thank you."" [Agent] ""Thank you appreciate your help on everything."" [Customer] ""Yeah.""

[Customer] ""I would like there to be."" [Agent] ""Or you still you are burdened with taking care of it. Should we put another name on there?"" [Customer] ""No, just I just want, you know, it would be I think easier if um somebody on site has the authority. Um, To do stuff cause they are the ones that are up there. I am down in Scottsdale."" [Agent] ""Got you. So, so is there any name I?"" [Customer] ""And I could add somebody and then you could always take them off if that is a no no."" [Agent] ""We can add someone later. Oh yeah. Yeah, absolutely I could, I could add someone now or we could add them later, not a problem."" [Customer] ""OK. Let us add now."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""It is um Leslie, L E Z.

[Customer] ""OK. Um, F as in Frank, D as in David. At Cooper Companies.net."" [Agent] ""Alright, that is the one we have."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""And what I will do is I will make sure I email you over there because I do not have a direct line, so this will be the best way to do it."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""You need anything you can simply email me we go from there Makes things a lot easier. Alright, and then I just make sure like I said, you get this promo pricing."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""I know that is important."" [Customer] ""How long does that last for?"" [Agent] ""The problem with this one for the gig is X years if you have a good payment history, uh, you know, you call in towards the end Optim's all about customer appreciation. You have a good payment history they will extend it for you."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Alright, now I am going to need a X digit access code for this one as well. Do you want to use the same one?"" [Customer] ""Yes, please."" [Agent] ""And that was"" [Customer] ""XXXX."" [Agent] ""All right. Excellent. Alright, so let us get you. Let us get you set up on this one. And then, and then also like when you get with your tech guy and then he decides, you know, you need like static IP or anything added you could simply email me you will not have to worry about calling in or any of that anymore."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Even if it is something else, even this tech, you know you email me I will live transfer you to the person just to try and save you the trouble So now you have at least a direct."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Alright, give me one second I am putting this through now. And then the the FD email at Cooper companies you will get the whole thing right there to outlining the whole install so if you need to change anything real simple you just email me. Now do you guys have mobile or tablets for the business?"" [Customer] ""Um, I think they do."" [Agent] ""OK. Because we just teamed up with T-Mobile, so we are using our networks along with theirs and. Uh, if you bundle a mobile or a tablet line, you get a $40 discount on the internet price. So that XXX, that XXX will turn in XX and then if you do auto pay it turns into XX."" [Customer] ""OK. OK."" [Agent] ""Alright, let us get this. Internet Bring that Alright, just give me one second. Now on the day of install, it would be best for them to call you or do you are going to have a better number for them to reach like your IT guy?""

Well, we do not have any service with us now at all, so it is not going to affect anything in your billing cycle with, you know, as it pertains to your current company."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""You may want to reach out to them because, you know first thing you want to do is make sure that you have a successful installation, right Make sure we set everything up the way you need it to your liking and it is working the way you need to work before you cancel anything."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""The only thing that is going to, you know, stop working from bright speed on that day are the phone lines because we are going to bring them over when we activate to this side. So as of June 2nd."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""You know, if you, if let us just say Bright Speed bills you from the 1st to the 30th, you will want to call and ask them if they prorate or if they are going to bill you for the whole month, you know, things of that nature."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""OK, so I am going to send you an email."" [Customer] ""Mm."" [Agent] ""mhm I am going to send you an email with the email you are going to send me a copy of your Bright Speed phone bill, and the last thing you need to do with me is called third party verification."" [Customer] ""Uh Yeah, so sorry, what then would it be better if we installed it?"" [Agent] ""This is an automated system that verifies that you are giving us permission to retrieve those numbers, OK? Once you complete that, you are all set to go. Your account number that'll be associated."" [Customer] ""Um, China started in May."" [Agent] ""I mean, that'll be up to you. Like I said, we, the next available days if we if you want to do it in May."" [Customer] ""Um, yeah, sorry, if you can change it."" [Agent] ""OK, so we have we have Thursday or Friday"" [Customer] ""In May it is possible if they do on Thursday."" [Agent] ""You want to do Thursday? Between XX and X?"" [Customer] ""And it will not affect our numbers at all. It was just everything will work fine."" [Agent] ""Everything will work fine between now and that day on the twenty-ninth when we come in to install that is when the numbers will switch over to us."" [Customer] ""And can we still receive calls when during the end this year or?"" [Agent] ""There may be some downtime, you know, your phones will work , you know, up until the numbers are ported you know, at all the, you know, once we in between, I would allow at least for an hour of downtime in general"" [Customer] ""Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah, cause I do not know if Bradley does um. What you just said and we do not want to, you know, pay for the whole month just so I get it canceled so."" [Agent] ""No. So like I said, we could schedule it for the 29th for now if need be, right?"" [Customer] ""Uh Mm"" [Agent] ""If you find out Bright Speed does not do that, then you can call, we can reschedule it for the 2nd. But at least you will have your order placed. There will be no there will be no interruptions between now and then We do not, we only contact Bright Speed on the day that we come out to install."" [Customer] ""Yes, OK."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""And then I also have another question with this one. Um, Is there like a price, uh. Uh, increase, is it like a price lock thing we can do? You can just lock the XXX."" [Agent] ""This is a price lock."" [Customer] ""It is OK."" [Agent] ""It is, it is priced out for XX months though, it is a XX month offer. After the XX months, right? Depending on what the other promotions are, if we have a renewal option, you can renew it at that time if they have a renewal option, if they have a better promotional together at that point, you can enter into that."" [Customer] ""Uh huh."" [Agent] ""If you do not like any of the deals moving forward you decide you want to cancel, you are not in a contract You are not in a contract during the XX months either so you have the freedom to do what you want the entire time"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah.

Uh, I think they would approve it I want to make sure and, um, like I said, we, you know, me and the, the, the technician was talking, he just did not know all the figures, so you know, he is the one saying that I need to call and and double check and everything Yeah. Yeah, so Alright, let me run it by search book, uh. Y'all should have my email account. Then this I have HNLAC XXXX@gmail. That is correct. That is the church email that is correct so uh. Yeah, alright So this is how we do these. Uh, would y'all, uh, just I need say like one day next week and let me run this by the church board to see if it is been approved or not, OK, alright. Yeah So this is what this is how we usually do it, Jim, just because we have everything so we can keep the promo and everything. I am going to put you in for a date for an install and it could be, you know, X weeks from now. It does not matter, but at least it gives us time, you know, for you to speak to the board, right? I am going to send an email to the church email right now just so you have my contact because I do not have a direct line, otherwise you will have to call in then you will have to do this all over again and and we do not want things changing on so Yes. OK. Do you have access to the email now? Alright, yes Yes sir, I am going to um. Oh Looking at them on freshing it. I got it. Jerry Nichols. Alright, that is me. Alright, so you got my, so you got my, uh, email. That is the best way to do it. What I will do is I will put you, I will put you in for an install for Friday the 30th. Yes. That is still X days from now. So you have plenty of time to talk forward, OK, if. Yeah. If for some reason they decide that you know they want to change anything or they want to go higher because we could still go to the XXX speed if they wanted to upgrade we still can do that. All you have to do is simply email me or if they want to push out the date into June simply email me I can do that as well. OK, alright, we are looking at basically one month. Oh Yeah, so yeah, I am going to give you a recap. So you are upgrading to the XXX internet, OK, it is XXX a month. Huh? It will go down to XXX when you do auto pay. Yes, so we, we do auto pay right. OK. Excellent. So that is 1:10 and I waived any installation fee and right now we are holding Friday the 30th, XX to X because that is the only spot we have available that day. OK, alright then I, I will talk, I will talk to him this Sunday uh I will talk OK. Exactly. Yes sir, first of, uh, right after the holiday. And then Oh yeah, perfect then so on that day, the 30th, XX to X, about a half an hour before I put your number the XXX-XXX-XXXX for the tech to call when they are on their way. OK, so he has to physically be here when you do the uh uh provision update? Yeah, they are going to do that. They are going to, it should be, it should not be difficult. It should be pretty in and out, but they just have to do, they have to hook up their uh their computer to the modem, do all that, uh, computer nonsense, but you will be up and running after. OK, uh, yes sir, I will talk to him this Sunday. Alright, so I am putting that in. You are going to get another email from Optimum, so you will have something physical to show them as well. Yes sir. Alright, so that is going through now. I got you set up so you are right now we are set for the 30th Any changes, anything you need, uh, simply email me. Um, another question, do you guys have mobile or tablet phones for the church? No, uh, we have X computers, uh, is what we run, I mean, it, and as far as that no, sir, not, not yet, we are a small country church Understood. Well, the reason I am saying is if you guys chose to add a tablet or a mobile line I can give you additional discounts of $15 on your internet uh price now that you have, um, the $300 speed OK, alright then I, uh, what would they need? I, I mean, I am I will definitely, you know, inquire with them what would they need to do that? Uh, well, they, they either need to bring a compatible device or they, um they can purchase a device if they wanted to finance one. OK OK, OK, alright then, so if our musicians wanted to get a tablet, uh, for, uh, what they are playing and everything, that that is a possibility then. I mean, they have new iPhones, they have older affordable options. They have some options that are like $4 a month for a brand new phone. So we have something for everybody. Mhm. Absolutely and then when you add that line, you get a $15 discount on the Internet price so that $110 would go down to $95. OK. OK, alright. OK, uh definitely let him know. So there is options all over the place. So I know it is a lot of information you are going to have to bring over to everybody, but if you need anything like I said simply email me. Yeah I would do so I appreciate it. Alright sir, thank you very much. I appreciate it you have a great weekend and uh thank you for choosing Opel. Yes sir you have a blessed holiday. You too sir bye bye. Uh OK, that is good."""

[Customer] ""I was like no"" [Agent] ""Yeah, that is, I mean, unless you have a pretty big system, uh, I mean, I mean that is a pretty big office type thing, uh, I mean it, it really as a matter of preference, you know, it is how it is being used, so I mean that is why what I suggest like."" [Customer] ""No."" [Agent] ""Or anything you are not bound to anything with us, you know, so that is why what I suggest is we do this at least I could put you in now even if it is a few weeks from now you could keep this promo and you do not have to worry about, you know, calling back in or anything like that. I could email you because I will be a single point of contact because I do not have a direct phone line. Uh, do you have access to your, uh, email now?"" [Customer] ""OK. Uh yes, I do."" [Agent] ""Alright, I just shot you an email let me know if you got it, OK?"" [Customer] ""Hold on. Yes, I did receive the email."" [Agent] ""Excellent. Alright, so what I usually do this is since you have, you know, you are waiting on approval just to hold everything I could set you up for something I could set you up for like the 16th or later in the month just so we hold everything together and then once you hear back you could simply email me if you need me to move up the date or you need me to push it out."" [Customer] ""OK, that sounds good. Can we do, let me see, uh, how it works with the phone line."" [Agent] ""Alright We need what?"" [Customer] ""XXX, my husband also says that we have.

[Agent] ""I have X to XX for a window, XX to X, or X to X for a window that day."" [Customer] ""Hm, let us do this. Why you do not put something together because I need to discuss that with my husband. He is out of the office right now."" [Agent] ""Yeah. Well, well, that is why I said this is the best way to do because you are going to get, I am sorry to interrupt, but this is the best way to do it you are going to get an email from Optimum, and it is going to outline everything and break it down so it is going to make it a lot easier to show your husband."" [Customer] ""Um. Let us see how, how, yeah. Mhm."" [Agent] ""So even if you decide you guys, hey, I do not want to do it, you simply email me we could cancel"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""That is no problem. I could put you out further in the month like I have, I have you know, the 23rd of, you know we could go to the end of the month so we have plenty of time"" [Customer] ""Sure."" [Agent] ""It is very easy to move it up as well."" [Customer] ""Uh, well, that sounds good. So let us say E effect, uh, internet service, static IP, and do the call for filings."" [Agent] ""So X phone lines?"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""OK, let me get."" [Customer] ""Unless uh well, yeah, we have X desks here."" [Agent] ""Hm."" [Customer] ""I do not know if we can have only X telephone you can ring in all the telephones"" [Agent] ""And like a phone, well, they do have a system like that, but that takes a little bit longer to provision."" [Customer] ""It is something that can be done."" [Agent] ""But what I will do is I will set you up just so we have this. That is something that takes longer to do. We, you know, we could get set up later, but, um, let me just set you up you said for the few lines now then we will go from there"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So it is XXX."" [Customer] ""OK, that sounds good."" [Agent] ""OK, so even with all that we are still at only XXX with all those lines. I am sorry, when you said X lines, correct? I apologize."" [Customer] ""X, yeah."" [Agent] ""Yeah, OK, so that was with X lines, so. Give me X 2nd. You Alright Alright, so it is a, OK, so let me just get that. So even with XX, that is, that is one too many, even with X lines we are still at XXX, so that is still considerably less than that the phone that you were paying previously the internet, so you are still way ahead right there"" [Customer] ""Mhm.

[Customer] ""At any given time, um, I know I have a lot of people they are using Wi Fi, but, um. I guess depending on like the type of router that you well. I can have any An internet connection I guess you can have up to what many connections up to XX or something like that, but. I am, I am not going to have that many you know, just not even, I do not think, I do not think XX, I do not think XX at any given time, you know OK, well, let me start with the one gig for you, James, because I mean you are going to have multiple things going on at the same time, multiple people, it is for a business, it is important. But not, not intensive like that though. Not intensive like that, you know, one gig. I, I, but just that is what I am saying, OK, you tell me what the one gig is. What speed did you have in mind? Uh-huh. OK, so the, the, the X gig there would be XXX with autopay and paperless, XXX without autopay and paperless. Yeah, just tell me OK, now go below that, oh, OK, now the one under that. The one under that. Let us see, should be the XXX. Because I just want to see what is going to, you know, work for me. I just, you know, and if I need to upgrade, I will look, I, I will actually go to the next tier, but I just want to see what, you know. Just I want to price these, you know, you said XXX, so what is below that. Right, yeah. It is the XXX which is XXX with autopay and paperless. Um, and then we have the um. OK. Then we have the XXX. The XXX there. Oh, what is that? Would be XXX. Now these prices though James are only good for you when you first sign up so I, I would hate for you to go to just say if you are just trying to go the cheapest route you are not really concerned about the you know if it is going to actually perform the way you need it to, you know, the right, but, but if you, but if you upgrade to the XXX to the XGB, you will not be at these prices that I am giving you now. Mm, let us see. I am sure it will, you know I go ahead, go ahead, I am sorry It will be more then you are, and then you are looking at another, uh, an actual appointment teic have to go out there and upgrade the equipment in order for you to get faster speeds Mm. Really? Yes sir, um. Really, mm, they, so they, so you can not just flick a switch and actually from XXX to XXX to a gig you saying somebody to come out and give me. Yes sir. Different equipment in order to get a faster speed, is that what you are saying to me? Yes, James. So with the X gig you get a XX channel modem. With the XXX, you get a XX channel modem then with the gig I mean then with the XXX, you get like a XX channel modem Mhm. Mhm. And now, so that is not just giving me a modem and I can just plug it up. Somebody has to come out and and and you know it is an appointment concerned. Yes, yes, we have to go out there and activate it correct. Mm. OK, so that is business, OK, so that is business now I was looking at um. Mhm. At an ad that said that you had like an introductory. I do not know if that was residential or something or, but it was much lower than that. And that is what made me say, oh shoot, you know, I am, I am, I might look into getting them. OK. This call. Right, is this um an actual apartment or or is this like what kind of? Well, this is, this is, this is an apartment. This is an apartment I have best good consulting is my business That is, you know, it is my business I can, you know, I would think, go ahead So So you are going to be working out of this address this is your home Yes, yeah. You are in apartment XXX. OK. I just want to make sure just because, because I do not want to burst your, your bubble. So if this is a resident, is this, if this is a residential address, then yes, you can have residential services with the business you would put under the business name, business information you probably it at the end of the year with taxes purposes, um, you know, being that it is a residential, you will be sharing it with amongst everybody here at the apartment complex, uh, with the business. Yeah. Saying what? The Internet signal because we have the main, the main line comes in through the nodes. It is either, it is either going to be a residential node or business node. So we are not going to be like, you know we are not going to have a business sharing the signal with somebody's home It does not work that way, uh, just because we, we, we invest more on the business side because that is how you, you know, you actually make money. So if it goes down, you guys could lose thousands of dollars versus a residential that goes down, it is, you know, it is it is not, it is not built that way. You know, uh, but you do have that, you do have that option though since this is a residential, um, address. Mm Mhm. I just want to give you some of those key points, something to think about before you make that decision. OK, now, hm. Yeah, because I know that I do not know, mm, being down and that kind of stuff, I am not really too keen on that, but um, oh, so if I did residential, what would that be? Mhm. But you are not the residential side so you could not tell me, right I would have to Exactly, exactly. So the prices that I gave you comes with the Internet service, it comes with the equipment, uh, it actually has a backup too as well, so that is good to know too. The backup is if there is ever any outages with the Internet service, it is going to switch over to a uh cell phone signal. Mhm. So you will always be connected. OK. Mhm mm. And then once the issue is resolved they will switch back to your main source. Let us see, OK. Yes, the X, the XXX, uh then, you know, just information for you to know, James, uh, the XXX is a X year is a X year promotion, the XXX and the and the X gig is a X year promotion Hm. Mhm. There is no contracts with us. OK. You can make changes at any time. OK. So again, I am just giving you information to know. And that is where that is for all three paid, right? Exactly, yes sir. That is OK. OK. It, the one that is different is the X is the XXX that is a X year. Right. Now what did you see on TV? OK It was like a, it was either XX or XX, like, you know, and it was not on TV it was actually on uh It was actually on the internet so but um that is what I sort of like introductory, you know, know bring us your business or whatever or not your business, but yeah, your business, but bring us, you know, you come to us and this is what we can do for you, you know, uh, that, that made me like, you know, because I was looking at Verizon, you know, I mean, I am a T-Mobile business customer. Mm. Let me see what I can do. Mhm. I am going to have lunch with them. And I do not like I want to get Internet service. In, in, in, uh, at XXX Green and I am I am my lease, I am going to be there May 1st I did not want to go to T-Mobile I did not want to use T-Mobile because I I do not know if I I did not like the fact that they had like a, it was like a wireless. I guess a wireless router and nothing wired coming into the house or whatever so I, I do not know, I am not really too, too keen on it, you know, and I just want to, yeah, I was not going to use them, so I went to Verizon and they, you know. Right. Right. They, they showed me something so I, I was going to go with them then I saw The Optimum, I said, hm, and I know that Optimum and Verizon, they are the ones that service, you know, XXX Green, and I just, you know, like, OK, let us see. You know, So let me see what I could do for OK let me see I am looking into something. So I got Verizon's price. I appreciate that information. What if I do something like this with you? Give me one moment. I am trying to get as close as I can to that dollar marker. Um, what if I do like the $500 for you I opt you out with the backup If I opt you out of the backup, it will be uh $90. It will be a X year promotion and that is what you sign up with autopay and paperless. And it would be the XXX megabytes per second. Installation on that. Yeah, that is still, that is still more than what I I would be getting That is, that is still more than what I would be getting with with Verizon, so. What speed? XXX, it was XXX of Horizon. It was XXX. XXX, yeah. Yeah, and they wrote me up and everything, you know, they sent me a quote and all that kind of stuff, so I mean I have all that with them, but I just saw, uh, Optimum. I saw that I saw your ad I just said, hm, you know. And being being the optimum and the ride in a service XXX green, that is why, you know, it is what we, you know, want to see, want to see what you guys could do, that is all. Right. I am trying to work with you here one second here. Mm. Alright. And I do I have to lease the motor for you? Um, so like for example this is a X year promotion, so those for that, so for that for that X years there, there will not be at least a charge for you on rental. After the X years, it would be. But after X years you are going to charge me for the modem? Yes, it is $15. So I have X, so I have X, what did you say it is XX what? XX. Hm, $15. Mhm. Uh-huh, so I have X years to go get my own modem is what you are saying. After X years. Mhm, yes sir. Uh-huh, I see. Yes sir, plenty of time if that is if that is what you want to do. Mm. No, yeah, I am just, yeah, if, if, if you hit the right dollar amount and it was $15 I do not know, yeah. I know that Verizon So look, how about this? Uh, they said Oh, what, what?

I did not want to spell it out because I normally give the, the, the, uh, phonetic, you know, the codes, you know, I mean the letters, you know, as I go along, but I did not want to do all that if you already knew how to spell it. So Bessica Consulting.us. U S not come. Because I do, I do business, uh in different, you know, areas Africa, Dubai, all that kind of stuff, yeah Got it. The US. Nice and name of the business? Mhm. Just the XX I am assuming, yeah, that is it. That is a good consulting. Oh, that is of the LLC. I am sorry yeah, so yeah, the LLC And then the tax ID or EIN number. Yeah, XX XXX XX XX OK Hello? Yes, I am here. Just one moment. OK, then yeah, OK. And put everything together. Mhm. So I can just confirm with your date and time. Yes. Now while I am putting this together, another way to save money, James, uh, we do offer cell phone service. We are using T-Mobile towers. I do have a plan, unlimited talk, text, and internet for $45. You can keep the same cell phone device, same cell phone number. There is no contract with that too as well. The reason why I wanted to bring this up is because. Uh, with the X gig internet that you are signing up with, um, if you get the cell phone service at $45 you get an extra $40 discount off of your internet. If you do the math, it would be $5 extra dollars you get cell phone service So you know $80 for the autopay and paperless plus the X so it is $85 that you would be paying for internet and cell phone. Oh wow. Mhm, you can keep that. And I have to lock that in today? Um, I mean, yeah, to get it, uh, to, to get it today, yes sir, yes sir, to get it today you can, yeah. I would have to Mm. Mm. Wow OK I use it for you or? For a loved one or whoever you, you know, employer, you know a person, whatever Um well Mm and I have the same number and the same I have the same number in the in the same uh phone the same number, same phone. And you will be underneath the business name and business information. Exact yes sir, exactly, um, as long as the phone is paid off, is the phone paid off? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, the phone's paid off, yeah. Oh perfect so it is probably like a newer phone, um, we will send you. It is a default, it is a default, yeah, Samsung default, yeah. Got you. Got you so I will ask for the EIN number for it. I will send you uh the information uh you will get an email. You already have my number. I am sorry, uh, the IMEI number of the phone. Oh, OK, yeah, yeah. Sorry about that. And then um. Mm. You so you get the, you get an email, uh, we will see the SIM card, it should get to you within, I would say anywhere from X to X days. And then you will follow the instructions to activate your phone and then boom you will have our service. Mm, uh. Uh. Mm. Oh. Yeah, that would be much that would be much better. Um, So you need the IMEI right now. Uh yes sir, mhm. Because you, you said that you send me a SIM card and. That SIM card is not going to get to me for for a few days you are not going to disconnect my service today Right. Exactly, we are not. You will you will still have working services. Mhm. And then once you get the information it has instructions on how to activate it and then the switch would actually happen, so you will never really be down honestly. OK. Yeah, we make it pretty, we make it pretty easy. Uh Yeah, but, um, uh. Yeah. OK. You know, I like the sound of this. Mhm. Wow Hm. Hey, wow. And then so what you are saying is that. It would be $8085 and so I do autopay and once I do autopay, it will be $80 and I will have uh my cell phone service and internet, you know, uh gigabit service. Yes, so the way it starts off, it is, it is going to be um. Because uh you are not going to do the auto pay and paper this with me today, so it is going to be $85 today, you know, that is what I am going to be quoting you for the internet service, right? Mhm. $85 and then you are going to sign up for the mobile for $45 and once all that becomes active, uh, you get a $40 discount on your internet. Right. And when is that so. So, so it just depends. Oh, OK. Yeah. It just, it just depends on you on when you set up auto pay and paperless. So it could either be XX at the end of the day with the auto pay and paperless or it could be XX if you do not set up auto pay and paperless. But either way, I mean, you sort of, still a great savings there and it is and there is no contracts with it. That is what I like about the service there. So when you write, so when you, when you, OK, we are going to, well I because I gave you my EIN and all that kind of stuff, uh, I just did not give you the IMI number, but when I give you that today when you write it up, you are going to send me like a, I guess, you know, confirmation or contract or whatever, um, not a contract because you do not do contract, but you are going to send me something in writing stating what we discussed and stating. It is just laying everything out how much everything is going to be correct? Correct, uh huh. OK, so I am not going to be paying a cell phone and internet. I am not going to be paying more than $90 at any given month. And now if I actually do the auto pay, it will be $85. Right, correct. Yes. Yes sir, give me one moment, let me check on something. OK, so I am not missing anything. No, you are not missing anything. Yeah. The only thing that you will pay today. It is because of the cell phone and it will be the activation. Which is going to be like XX plus tax so XX bucks is not change Are you going to bill me for that? You are going to bill me for that, right? Because I am not. No, not for the cell phone. Activating the cell phone today. Right, not, not for the cell phone service. I can not do that. That is the only thing that you will, that you will pay because you are initiating, you are agreeing to move forward with the cell phone service, so we are it is, it is going to happen. Right, right. That is why the activation fee is required. But it is not going to happen until you actually send me a SIM card I am activating the phone, am I correct Where when, yes. It is Because I mean as soon as we send it to you you are going to you are going to you are going to activate it. I mean you are not going to just hold on to it. Why would you do that? Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I do not want you to say, so you said X to X days I am not going to be at that address just yet That is what I am saying to you that I, you know, like, I am OK, well, I am not going to be there just yet. Oh, I got you so. Understood James, so your tax ID or slash EIN number is, is, is associated with another uh address, right? Yeah, right now, yeah, right now, yeah. OK, hold on one second. But I do not, go ahead, go ahead. You know what? I bet, I bet what I am going to find out. I bet they are going to, since you have a newer model phone. I bet we are going to email it. Yeah. I bet we are going to email it to you, so you, you are still going to be fine. One second. Email it to me the uh email what to me? The SIM card. Information. You are going to, it is going to be E soon? Yes sir. Because you got a newer phone, right? Hmm, cause I have a Yeah, yeah I, I believe I have a SIM card in my phone right now You said you got a. That is fine. Because I, I mean, I have that, I had this phone since what, what, what, XX, no, no, XX, I believe I got it in XXXX in in like September XX I thought that I put a SIM card in here I thought that I had a SIM card that they sent me. When they sent me the phone, I thought I entered it inserted a SIM card. It is a Galaxy ZXX. And they only have one newer phone come out since this because this I have no problem with this phone. It is, it is perfect it is, it is, it is thing it works fine, but that is why I never because I normally upgrade every year to a new phone. Mhm. There is only one new phone that came out, the ZX X, you know this is the ZX X, so But an e-card, I do not know. I do not, I do not, I do not know, but I, I do not, I do not know if I need it. This should tell me once I get the IMEI number from you. One moment, I am trying to get that far. Oh hold on. Mhm. OK can I have you on speaker because I am just actually pulling up uh. By about age to look. Are you calling me from your cell phone number now? You hear me? Yes, I can hear you, James. Yeah, I am. Yep. Are you calling me from your cell phone number now? I am. OK. Yes I am. Alright, one moment, the XXXX number. That is right, XXX-XXX-X, yeah. OK. Alright, IMEI number. What, uh, what is your IMEI number? You got it. Oh, I thought you, I am looking for it. I am looking for it. Take your time. Let us see. OK, you ready? Yes, I am ready, yes. Hello? OK, XXXXX. XXX. XXX XXX. XXXXXX, but you know what? Right below it, it says ESM. The EMIMI IMEI, they are two different numbers. OK. So which number do you prefer? Give me the the EA number. Let us try that one. OK, I will give you that right now. OK, XXX. XXX XXX XXX XXX Got it. Galaxy ZX X, that is what it shows perfect. One moment. Now you are not going to disconnect my number today, right? No, no, no, sir, absolutely not. OK. Yep, it is uh eSIM compatible, so yes, you will get an actual email, so you are good you are covered on that one. So we will not be sending it to the same address uh huh. OK, now OK. So what, so what goes on now? What, what, you know, what do you, what, what is next? Um, let us see, so it is showing that monthly, I am, I am trying to pull up some taxes for you just a second. Alright, so the monthly will be XXXX for the mobile portion and then was due today is only $20.53. OK, now what is it now you said the mobile portion. Mhm. So now when you send me the bill, when you send me a bill for, you know, uh, internet and internet and phone, what is it going to be? What is what is going to be my bill? like on, on, you know, a month. So it is It is going to be two separate bills because we do not want you because we do not want to interrupt your cell phone service because nowadays, you know, that is how everybody communicates now one reason is emergencies we are not going to, so like if you fall behind or whatever happens with your cell phone, we, we do not want to interrupt your, your, your, your cell phone service because of that. So it is going to be two separate bills, OK? So at the end of the day, let me add this up, so $85. Looks like there is X cents of taxes, so XX. And then plus XXXX. equals XXX minus. XX, so you are you are looking at $92.76. And this is what, yeah, this is what this is without you signing up for autopay and paperless on the internet part. OK, now. Now if this is broken up now, how, how, how are you charging me because you know minus XX, what is the XX coming from or what you know what is happening So the minus XX is going to be on the Internet bill. OK, so the internet bill is going to be. Um, it is XX, so and, and then if it is going to be XX, yes? XXX. Mhm. Yes. OK, OK, alright, so I could do that, huh. He said Right? Yeah, and you are going to write that up, right? and then Yes sir. You are going to. And then you said that uh May 1st between May 1st and May 5th. OK. Yeah. See what I got. So May the first is a Thursday like you said I see that. Yeah So I have that. Oh you did not believe me, oh man. No, I got you. Uh, so I have that day available the 2nd, the 3rd, the 4th, which the 3rd and 4th are Saturdays and Sundays. Looks like we have both days available and then May 5th Cinco de Mayo. Yeah. Uh monday. Oh you, XX you are not going to be you are not going to be available, huh Uh, not me, not on that day. I am, yeah, I know, you give me a tequila, huh, huh. Something like that. Yes sir. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand. I was your age at one time, man. It Alright. I am I am XX, so I do not I do not do that no more Oh well, I was your age. I am, I am XX. You said you do not drink no more. Oh, OK, you still got me. No, sir, I do not drink no more. No, I am done. OK, XXX, OK, well, you are going to be doing something. Yes sir. Yeah. You just, I heard you when you said it so you are going to be doing something, you know, you got a shorty something something, a shortywp or something Oh, for sure, for sure. Um, I will probably, I will probably just grow here at the house, have family over. On the weekend, yeah. OK, oh, so you, you, you are not in New York or whatever. No sir, I am in Texas. Oh OK. XX, man, so you, yeah, oh, OK. Well, you got Cinco de Mayo then the next month you got, um, what will you be celebrating Juneteenth Juneteenth, uh Um, I probably will, honestly. I have not really got that far yet, as far as my planning goes. XX, that should be a given man. But yeah, I am sure. Yeah. Juneteenth was originated in Texas, man. Right. So you, do you know about Juneteenth? Not too much. I got, I got friends that, uh, they always uh cook out too as well. Oh OK. OK, OK, so you you do your research, you will learn about Juneteenth. Yeah, we are, we are real big and grilling. Yes, sir. Yeah, yeah. So as, as, as far as the days the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th, what day should I reserve for you? Again, you can always call back in and move it around as you see fit. OK, well, the, I would say this, oh man, I want to say the 5th, but then. I know Tuesday I will probably definitely be available on the 6th. OK. Yeah, um, so probably the 6th. You got it Tuesday. Just to be, you know, just to be safe you said that I can actually call Absolutely. And, and, and change it, yes, but you can, you can pencil in it for the X. Yes. Got you. OK. So the 6th, uh, Tuesday, uh, you want me to reserve X to XXXX to X? Um, XX and X. XX to X right. Yeah And so the bill will be broken up. It will be, so I always pay the XX no, wait a second Hm. You said that I am trying to understand again what what what what bill I am going to get. The bill that you are going to get um is right, right, as of right now, you are not going to get anything about the internet. We are not going to bill you we are not going to charge you anything because you do not have the service The only thing that you are going to be paying for is just the cell phone service and then once the cell and then once the internet is, is active, is when we will tie everything in a bow and put it all together for you. OK, but OK, and I understand that um. And that is when you will see those and then that is when you see those savings. OK, but the savings will be because you just said that I will, I will have to, you said the the bills are separate and it is like a. The XX X $85 and then XX. OK bye. $40 something dollars and you said they are separate, right? XX. Right. XX, but so, so now once I am getting those savings, what will the bill be? So as of right now it would just right as of right now it would just be the XXXX because that is just for the cell phone because you are going to get that within within within within a week from today. I know you said mine is $40. Right, you are going to activate the the the eSIM so you are going to just have cell phone services with us. Yeah. So you are going to just be charged a XXXX and then once the installation is complete. And how long do I have to Mhm. How long do I am sorry, I apologize. Go ahead, sir. I am sorry. No, go ahead. How long do I have to activate the eSIM? Um, that is a good que I mean, as soon as you get it, that is, that is what I would do. Because, because I know that if, if, because I know that um I am probably going to be billed, my, my bill for um T-Mobile is on the 10th. I mean Mhm. And once they get me for this month it will be for what it will be for the next month so I do not want to. You know, get the EastM on the on the 13th or 14th or 15th you expect me to Activated right then when I just paid another month of T-Mobile. You know what I am saying? Right, but should they uh retro it back for you? Because we are going to take over that telephone number. Oh T-Mobile. They are not going to, right, they are not going to own that number anymore. You know, they do not own the number, no, but I am saying I am, I am paying for a month of service for them now. We are on that number. Got you. So whenever you disconnect because that that that account should go dead once you activate our our eSIM. And I know that, but I, meaning that I, meaning that, that means that I will actually be. Wasting the money that I paid for that month. You know what I am saying if I am paying that month for it for that service. Oh, there is, they are still going to charge you regardless. Uh-huh. So they are going to charge you regardless. Well they charge me the XX. That is That is when my bill comes in. I am not going to say, oh, do not charge me anymore because I need the service. And you are not going to send me the ESM on the before the um before the 13th or whatever I mean and they are going to charge me on the 10th. Got you. Let me find out, see how long you have with the ECM. That is a good question. I never had that question asked. Mhm. I am definitely I am definitely serious about this, you know Because they are going to Yeah, they are going to because they are going to because from what you are telling me they are going to charge you regardless if you disconnect they are going to charge you for for a whole month regardless on when you disconnect the service yeah. They are going to charge me, yeah, they are going to, they are going to charge me my they are going to charge me my monthly bill, and they get that on the 10th. Mhm. And get that on the 10th, you know, so. Yeah Mm. Yeah, they, they, yeah, they get it on the 10th and I do not want to pay it on the 10th. And And then I get your ESI on say even the 15th. I could get your EIM on the 15th and you expect me to to connect it on the 15th, that means. I have XX days of service that I am not going to get because I paid you guys. I activate it with you guys you see what I am saying Mhm. Mm. I am waiting for you. I am sorry? No I did not know if you, if you were waiting for me to say something or whatever. I did not know, OK. Oh no, I am I am waiting on to get a response from my mobile team OK. To see, like, uh, once we send you the, the eSIM, how long do you have with it, um, to activate it. Mhm. I am counting on you, man. I am, I hope you got this. I have never had optimal service so I am hoping that your service is pristine Oh yeah. I could tell people the best experience is your own experience, right? Um, you, you know, like they say, oh, it is good for you, but it was not good for me. Yeah. Uh, the good thing is there is no contracts with us. So, I mean, that is, that is, that is the way out for you, you know. Mm. Um, but yeah, am not am not nothing like it. We are, I feel like we are the best in town. You know, we do not, we do not have to, we do not have to lock you into a contract and hope things work out, you know. OK. So that is what I like about it too. I, I personally have our cell phone service I personally have our internet service Oh, OK. Oh, do you? Mhm. So you have never been down. Never been down and I go hunting and I go fishing, so sometimes I am, I am in the middle of nowhere. OK. Sometimes, and I still get, and I still get signal here. Oh. Something efficient, uh-huh. Yes sir. OK. I guess I asked the question of the day, huh? Yes sir. Mhm. Alright, so while I am waiting for them to answer me, um, I am going to go ahead and reserve May 6th between XX and X. Mhm. I have your cell phone number here, of course, as a courtesy call. OK. Mhm. OK, yeah, so they are, they are telling me that they do not, they can not say that they are still going to still charge you for that full month even if you disconnect them, you know, before your bidding cycle ends with your mobile carrier. So what are you saying? So if you, if you just want to hold off on this, Mr. Simmons on the mobile part until you find out. Mhm Mhm. Uh, with your, you said you have T-Mobile, you may want to call them and be like, hey, if I go to another carrier and, and, you know, put the number over to them. am I going to get charged for the for the time period that my cell phone's activated with y'all or is it going to be charged for the full month regardless? And then you can pinpoint on when you want to activate. Well they are not because they are not going to know. I am not going to. Uh, they are not going to know. I mean, if I, if I actually, I get charged on the 10th, and if I get the SIM card like say on the 15th or whatever. They are not going to know they are not going to give me a a credit, are they? What you saying that they are going to give me a credit? I would think they would you know I am not T-Mobile Yeah, yeah, OK, well, yeah, well. You know because that that is how that that is that is how that is how we would do it for you. You know, that is how I assumed that that they would do it because you do not, you do not have it active with them. So how, so So So wait a second. So now, so if I, I go through with everything with you so my next call should be the T-Mobile to ask him that question Right, because I am not. Because I can not, I can not. No, no, no, I, I understand that, but what I am saying I am just playing it out so. I Well, I just try to give everything up because that like I, I try to, I, my mind works quick and I, I just forget, so I am just, I have to do that because. You You said that I would now. If I do not do it with you today or you said to hold off, you told me to hold off, so if I do not do it today, I will not be able to get that deal, right? No, you will you will What I am going to do too is I am going to shoot you my card. So whatever you find with T-Mobile later today, you can always email me back and be like hey Danny, they told me I am going to, you know, that I will receive credit. Can you please call me back so I can, you know, uh, start the mobile today then I will, you can then I will call you back Or if you need to wait till, you know, the end of your billing cycle with them, you can always email me back and be like, hey, you know, call me. I am ready to set up services for the mobile whenever you are ready. Does that make sense? It makes sense I mean I am doing, I am talking to you today so I am just like, you know, mm Yeah. want to set it up because I mean I do, I do want the service. I want both. I want both I want the savings, you know Right, well, we, the, the, the, the one thing we have not said. Hm. Is how much you are paying with mobile.

So they, I know everything, so it is easy for me, you know."" [Agent] ""Yeah. Yeah, it is interesting that you say that because we do all our packages now come with a new failover service because we have people in your area that have issues with weather and with you know having that. So what what the backup does is it allows you to maintain services even if there is an outage for up to X hours, phone and internet, so you will not be missing, uh, any sales and things like that. So, uh."" [Customer] ""Uh, the thing is I do not need the backup one. I just need the internet."" [Agent] ""OK, that is fine. OK, well, that is fine. I mean, I, you know, because you have intermittent things and people like I said in the Texas region, especially uh in the Tyler area are taking advantage. But if you do not need it, hey, you know it, you know your business. Now I wanted to ask you how much are you currently paying um for your internet package?"" [Customer] ""XXX"" [Agent] ""OK, so this is what I was going to tell you because I know that you, you know, you said you had the XXX. This is what I would like to do for you. This is definitely what I can do. So I have our gateway promo."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""It is going to give you the XXX internet.

I can give you the XXX internet. It is going to cover your POS systems that you have, any cameras that you add, any Wi Fi that you want to share with your customers, or even if you decide to do DoorDash in the future.

Um, there is a one time install of $100 if you sign up for autopay, uh, you will get a $5 discount so you can get as low as $120 just by signing up for autopay Um, I can, uh, I am just trying to see when I can get a tech out to set that up for you, and we also have additional savings with Optimum Business Mobile if you wanted to get a cell phone as well, but without the cell phone, without the auto pay, it is just XXX and um like I said I just need to know from you um who is going to be on site because we can uh come over there and install services.""

[Agent] ""Right, it is XXX plus plus taxes, so whatever the taxes are going to be in your area, that is going to be calculated, um, so keep in mind I do not take any money from you and you do not pay the tax, so everything's going to come on a bill and it will show you the XXX and whatever taxes are available in your region because it is based on your state and your town and local things like that so we do not make the taxes, but the, the taxes are added based on uh the area of the business.""

So one time set up fee of $100 which is billed to you, there is nothing to pay today or to the technician you want to go with the gigabyte"" [Customer] ""Um, I do not think, I think that might be too much. We probably tried the I think there was a XXX megabytes"" [Agent] ""Oh, it is XXX."" [Customer] ""That you guys have available um online that I saw for $60 a month. We do not know if that is still available."" [Agent] ""That is is um the, the, the minimum offer would actually be XXX megabytes and that is $60 with autopay, but that is very little internet, it is like $300 over $30."" [Customer] ""Oh,"" [Agent] ""If you want though, we could do XXX megabytes, which you can do for. I know XXX megabytes would be $100. And that is a XX month offer versus a X year offer."" [Customer] ""Mhm. That is a X month."" [Agent] ""XX months is how long the rate will be good. It is not a contract, but it is longer, you know, if you did the, even if you did the minimum offer, that is only good for X year."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK."" [Agent] ""After one year, the rates will increase."" [Customer] ""I see. I see. Let us try that one first and then if that does not help then we can always increase the megabytes, right?"" [Agent] ""You, yes, you can, but it is more expensive to increase on the back end than it is to take a, you know an offer right now"" [Customer] ""Oh, OK."" [Agent] ""But it is up to you if you want to try here, mhm."" [Customer] ""Cause I do not know, I was not sure. I do not know how much internet we will be needing, um, cause it is a brand new business."" [Agent] ""OK Right. Uh, if it is X, if it is for cameras I would recommend at least XXX megabytes You know, even if you do not need the gig, I understand cause you are not using it for anything else."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""You said maybe some TVs in the future, but if you are looking at X cameras or so, things of that nature, even if you decide to add, you know a TV or two in the back end I would not go any less than XXX megabytes"" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK, OK."" [Agent] ""That is my recommendation."" [Customer] ""Let us do that Yeah OK."" [Agent] ""OK, you get a longer deal with that anyway. You get like as far as your savings go, it lasts longer at the price of $100 than it would for the $300. So in the long run it is more bang for your buck. Give me one second.

So it looks like someone disconnected that account last week that is why it is not working. Oh, it is disconnected. Oh, you disconnected it. OK. Um, so, All right, maybe he wants to, uh, you know, disconnected maybe he wants me to start my own I mean we can set up your own account. What kind of deals? Huh? We can set up your own account at that address. OK, that how much is your Is it, is it going to be it it. Uh, well, first, is it, is it going to be under the same, it is the same business name Medex RCM? No, it will be under my name, Canwell and TS now. And is it going to be a different tax ID? Yeah, because it is going to obviously be mine then. Right. Are you able to, just so I can make sure and check, are you able to verify what the X digit access code in this account was the last X of the tax ID Oh no, I will not, because that is not, that is his. I do not know what it is. Right, what, what is, and what is his name? His name is Anton and his last name is, first name is E H. Uh S H A A N. Uh-huh. And the last name is B U T T. OK, OK, so yeah, OK, so let me see. Um, Yeah, so as long as it is under a different name, it is under your name, under your business under your tax ID, we could definitely set up an account there under at that if you are still in that suite suite one. Suite one, yeah. OK So, um, how much are your rates? Uh, so did you want the same stuff as what you had previously? Yeah, pretty much. Uh let me see, let me see what was here before. So MedEx was that his company Deon's? Yeah, I believe so. Got you. Could be his brothers, I am not sure though. Right. That he was my, I was dealing with him I do not know where maybe he has a partner So I, I, I, I guess my question is like, um. If you are currently in that suite. Uh, was your business just using this account and, but it was, it was just. Yeah, yeah, he let, he let me, he let me use it, uh, but maybe he closed it because he wants me to do my own, but he did not tell me that. Mhm. That is why I was trying to contact him. He was not responding he is not around, but now Right. No, I understand. I just want to get an understanding of what actually was going on. So the name of your business is what? C A N W E L L M T S OK, so you were, so essentially you are running your business under that name you were just essentially piggybacking off of his internet for for MedEx LLC Yes, yes, he allowed me to keep uh the internet for a few months. Uh, Right. And I thought he would still, but randomly it closed. So, like you said. Right, so, right, so he, he just, he just connected the account, um. You said it all. So What I am going to do he was paying XXX bucks for XXX speed internet I can get you a way better package, um, because, because you are setting up a new account, um, so let us get started. Oh, OK. OK. The only thing is you are going to be offline for a couple of days because I have to send a tech out there to to install a new a new modem and all that stuff. Did he take all the equipment out of the of the suite? No, still around. Although he, although he still, he still have the router and everything, right? Yeah, he is still on the router. Well, he is going to have to return that somehow because you are going to get a brand new, you are going to get a brand new um. Brand new equipment and all that stuff. OK, you are saying it is like XXX. How much do you, uh, what is the, uh, the rates? What is the deal you have? Um, so, um. So tell me a little bit about your business. uh, what do you do on a daily basis? How do you use your Internet mostly? Uh, I have to send in for my, you know, high clothes. I have to do a little research, you know, uh, I have customers that buy promotional items from, you know, like I, I do a little bit of artwork to create, you know, things like that. Mhm. Right, Got you. OK, how many, how many employees do you have? That is what I do. Like how many computers are in the office there? Um, well, I have like uh X temporary employees like they. Mhm. Uh, as seasonal, you can say, uh, it is very, it is basically me and then maybe X or X more. Got you. OK. There is a television, uh, on in our lounge area, um, but like X or X maximum devices. OK. Mhm. Got you. That TV does that belong to you or does that belong to Mr. Butt? It belongs to him, but he gave it to me. He said I can use it. He said he can you can use it is he just going to Yeah, he said he told me certain things certain things he took he said that the the the one in, in the lounge, he said that I can keep that one OK, um, all right, so are you interested in any sort of as part of the package here, are you interested in any sort of TV service along with Internet? And all that stuff. Yeah, whatever there was, what would you have? Well, they did not have TV on their account, uh if you are interested in TV, obviously we can Oh, you know what? They did not have TV. They just have like a YouTube and stuff, sorry. Like streaming? You are right, yeah, streaming. OK, right, but for you, would you want actual TV cable service for that TV? Not really. I do not really, uh, I do not really have it. I thought he did, so I was just wondering I guess he does not Got you, OK. I mean. Understood, uh, but you, you, you will probably use it to stream and all that stuff, right? Yeah, yeah. OK, OK. Uh, I mean, if it is a huge difference, I do not really need it, honestly, but if it is like a few dollars, that is OK. Um, What Right, well, it really depends if you would like, obviously you can stream you have your streaming services, YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, whatever the case I will just compare that. Obviously, you know, um, your TV just connects to the internet. But if you wanted like actual TV service, you know, if you wanted to be able to watch certain news networks in the lounge, if you wanted like ESPN or sports or things like that, then yeah, you would need, you know some sort of uh cable package OK, tell me the difference first. Sure. Alright, so let us kinda get your profile going and then we can talk about packages. Um, So let me get your name one more time, and your first name. Canwell, C A N W A L C A N W A L Kanwall. And your last name? M S I M I M T I A Z. You said I N as in Nancy? No, M as in M as in mother. Yeah. So MTS. And the best phone number for you? XXXXXXXXXX Mhm. Mhm. XXXX that is Highway and suite one. Somelandia. And the name of your business was, it was Canwell. C A N W E L L M T S L L C. Mhm. M as in mother, T as in Tom, S as in Sock. And Canwell is like can, like a can, C A N W E L L, one word. Mhm. Got you. But your first name is spelled C A N W A L, correct? But yeah, yeah. OK, great. That is a little different. Right, right, uh. And the company name, similar or different. No problem, um, are there going to be any other authorized users on the account besides yourself? Mhm. Well, my employees might, but let us just keep me for now. If I need to add, I can ask for you. Got you. Yeah, no problem. And what is the best email address for you to send to you? Uh, I have my personal one then I have my business one Which one would be better for you? Whichever, whichever works better for you actually. OK, uh, since this is going to be a business I will give you my business one Sure. C A N W E L L. Mhm. MTS at gmail.com. Mhm. That is simple enough. You have no idea some of these emails I got. And uh are you going to have any sort of um. Any sort of cameras at the office, printers, fax machines, things like that? There is one camera. Mhm. Got you and then uh your tax ID do you have that on you? Oh my, my, you know what I will give it to you XX-XXX. Mhm. Mhm. XXXX. I think he is reinstating the optimum. He, he just responded to me. Is he? OK, we will try to call them, so I, you know. I mean he he does not have to like if you want to just kind of do your own thing that is already disconnected I can get you a better deal if you just want to break off from him and not even have to deal with him anymore, uh, you know it is probably in your better interest just to to set your own set up your own account. What is the deal. So, OK, give me the deal and then maybe I will just uh I will think about it cause he, he actually, you know. Sure, so. Um, I, I would not, I was not even paying extra for that, so, but the fact that it is security reasons, that would be fine, uh, but that is, that is, I will, I will, I will think about that, uh, when I, when you give me the PIN. Right. Right. And like, and like the reason is, you know, like, yeah, so. Without getting too personal, he is messing with your business, right? You know, he just deactivates. He says you can use his internet because you are in that suite, and he had a uh old account there and he just turns it off without telling you and then you can not get in touch with him, you know what I mean? So like it just seems like, you know, any sort of little scenario that may happen, he could just go ahead and turn off the internet because it is under his name whenever he wants to. Mhm You know what I mean and that is not, that is not good for you as a business owner. That is true. You know what I mean? Yeah, that is, yeah. So like, so you know, even if he wants to reinstate the account, I would just tell him no, it is fine I can I will just get my own, um. And things like that. So what I would recommend is we can do our, our X gig triple play. So that is XGB of internet. It is XXXX megabits per second as opposed to XXX that. You currently have right now. Um, it would come with a, um. Mhm. It would come with our business connection back up which is a backup modem so what happens is in any event. Your main internet were to go out. This backup modem automatically turns on. Mhm. And so you will not lose out on any connectivity throughout the day. Mhm. It lasts up to X hours you can continue to work if your main internet goes out And then it also comes with A dial tone. So you could use it for a business phone you can use it for a fax. Mhm. Um, and things like that, so if you were to do that package. You are looking at. You are looking at the same price, um, 1:30. So you are getting X times more internet, you are getting a dial tone for your phone for the business or for a fax or whatever the case may be you are getting that business connection back up, that backup modem essentially for the same price as what he is paying for just XXX speed internet So you are getting a way better deal you are getting a way better package, you are getting way better internet X year price guarantee There is no contract here with Optimum. Um, so like I said, it is in my in my opinion, it is in your best interest to set your own account up, um, to not even have to deal with that anymore. Because what happens if like because you said you may have got into a little argument with your landlord and then he turns off the internet like you want to deal with that again? Uh, not really. Uh, we do have a really good understanding I do not know why, because I had a, what happened was I had an accident I have not been coming to the office Mhm. Sure. I just came back and he probably thought that it was useless for him to pay for internet. Mhm. That is probably the reason, honestly. Right. Sure. You know, cause I was not in the office for a couple of months. Right, um, so. So, so he probably paused it because it was you are supposed to pay so he probably did that. Well, like he disconnected it all together. He did not put because you are able to pause an account and keep it active, um, but it is disconnected altogether, so, um. Oh Oh. All right. So yes. Well, uh, OK. Yeah, I understand what you are saying. Can you give me the, the rate, the price, did you give me the price? Yeah, so essentially it is the same price. XXX you get XGB instead of XXX, so you are getting 3.5 times the internet you get the dial tone you get the um the business connection back up that backup modem in the event, you know, there is an internet outage Oh, dial tone, does this, this, um, does he have a dial tone? He did not have a dial tone. He was just paying XXX for just internet by itself and slow internet for that matter. So I am giving you the fastest internet that we offer, it is X gig with the dial tone and the um. And that back up. The what? The backup modem. OK, oK. OK, um, $130 a month, right? Yeah, that is what our autopay and paperless billing discount of $5 so you get a $5 discount when you enroll in autopay and paperless billing. Otherwise the plan is $135. So you know if you want to save $5 a month just you know put a credit card on file and uh you know it is auto pay and you get paperless billing so your bills will get sent to your email as opposed to getting paper bills mailed to the office. Mhm. OK. Right, right, OK, you know, uh, I am going to think about this one night, see what he does, and then myself to figure out what is best for me. And then I will get back to you on that by tomorrow, OK? So what I would like to Or you can also reach out if you like. Uh-huh. Yes, so what I would like to do is um. Uh, what was I going to say? So in order to guarantee the price. We should Schedule an appointment. We should put you on the schedule. Uh, if you needed to cancel that appointment, it is totally fine. Like I said, there is no contract here, uh we want to get you on the schedule in the event you decide to do this route Our our schedule does fill up quite quickly, um. And it is already, you know, uh, a week or so into the month of April so if you wanted to just kind of lock in the price, get you on the schedule, and then you can kind of see what your landlord does so that way if he decides to just, you know, keep it the way it is you are already set up and ready to go. OK. Um, would you want to just. I, I can schedule it, but if he comes , uh, you know, what, what, what, what are you going to like if I do not, I have to call before, right, to cancel So yeah, obviously you would call before the install date to to cancel the appointment. Yeah, oK. Alright, when, when are you scheduling it? Um, so let me. Pull up my calendar here. I apologize, can I have your tax ID one more time? I, I do not know where it went. XXXXX Mhm. Mhm. XXXX. Mhm. And um While I am putting this together for you. Can you provide me with a X digit access code to put on this account here like a PIN number? Just like a random PIN number? Well, it is something you can remember, you know. OK. XXX X. Thank you. So if you decide to call up and cancel, they are going to ask you for that number so just kind of remember that, OK? OK. Alright, hold on one second. Um Um I Oh I am not I I. So are you able to work right now? Like how are you guys working right now? I am not able to. I am, I am I am like not working right now Right, right, right, right. I am waiting for his response. He said he might call them you know, he is doing Right, you might call. Uh, hold on one second. So I went to it. Oh it is working. Just a few minutes, Ms. Mia. I am sorry. No, no I know, I think I. Mhm Mhm Yeah Um. right now. Hello I And. OK. You said XXXX for the access code, right? Yeah. OK great. are Just waiting for my calendar to pull up right now. I Yeah. Yeah. So I can actually get someone there as early as tomorrow if you need a couple of days I can get someone there on Thursday I have Friday available. And then it goes into next week. You can do it tomorrow then. OK. Do it tomorrow because if I have to cancel, I will probably cancel the night evening when, when he decides what he is doing, if he is not doing it, then uh I will just move forward, so I do not want to waste time. Uh Mhm. At least, at least you have someone tomorrow, yeah, OK, OK, I got you. So if it, yeah, yeah, if he, they do come tomorrow, it it starts right away, the internet. Yeah, as soon as they install, uh, your internet should is going to be working, so you can work. Mm You know. OK, $130. I also had um hm that is uh. And you can also uh You know what? Yeah, go ahead. Um, I was saying you can also save an additional $40 a month if you bundle in your mobile. So if you were to switch companies on your cell phone and bring it over from your current company to Optimum Mobile. Um, we connected to the business account here you do get a $40 discount on your internet bill, bringing that $130 down to $90. Mhm. And uh the cost of your mobile one is only $45 for unlimited data, talk and text on the T-Mobile network uh so we did partner with T-Mobile for our mobile service so it is kind of like you are with a T-Mobile customer but obviously you are getting billed from Optimum, um, we did partner with them so you can also, you can always do that as well, um, if you. I have like X lines with them on this. You can do that too, yeah, you could bring over all X lines. Each line would be instead of $45 a line, it would be $30 a line as long as you bring over your current devices so you do get a $15 discount when you bring over multiple devices and you still will get that $40 off your Internet account here. Well my uh Bill with the three lines, uh. So yeah, so, so theoretically speaking, everything works out your cell phone bill will be $90 plus tax then your internet bill would be $90 plus tax $30 a line. So it would be $180 altogether. Uh, you start to receive the $40 discount on your internet bill after about after a billing cycle too, after the mobile ones are activated. Mhm. Um, Obviously for the first month or two it is going to be, you know, the $130 and the and the $90 for the cell phones and then like I said after the billing cycle or two, you start to see that $40 discount come off of your internet account bringing that down to $90 so be $90.90 dollars. Oh, OK. Yeah, so Yeah, it will be the T-Mobile T-Mobile towers in every state. All right. That sounds better, I think. And another thing is the service is still T-Mobile if I go like to another state or whatever OK, and so like what are, what is this cover like the features of they give me. You know, they have a like a magenta plan where I get like So, so essentially it would be, so it would be um unlimited data. Uh Uh, so it is kind of, yeah, so kind of just like the magenta plan where you get unlimited data but it is like it is capped at like XX or XX gigs, um, before they throttle you so it is the same thing. Unlimited data? Um, and then you get unlimited talk and text. And then you also, the only thing that is different from say the T-Mobile Magenta is like um some of the international features so if you travel abroad, I know with T-Mobile, a lot of that, a lot of that, you know, um international internet and calling is kind of included in that um we uh with Optimum it is an add on so we still offer it. Yeah. Uh, but we can add on for like if you are going away for a week, you add it on to your account for a week so you can make calls and, and browse the internet if you need it and things like that, uh, so that is that is the only that is the main difference between the two. What is the, how much is the add on? Um, it is like it, it, it is based on you can either do like a daily rate or you can do like um a weekly rate or something like that. Yeah. Uh, I am not sure about the daily rate, uh, I am not sure about the daily rate, but say, but say you are going to to London for a week, um, you could put on the you could put on the international package which allows you to browse the internet, make phone calls, send text messages, um, I think it is like $60 or something like that for the week. Oh OK. OK. Mhm. Oh, OK, OK, alright, but I do not really like to, yeah, OK, yeah, like, but I will have to call and activate that before I leave, right? Obvious, obviously when you, obviously when you come home and. Yeah. Yeah, before you leave you call and activate it when you come home you call and take it off, um. That is how that, that is how that works. Mhm. Do you travel abroad a lot? OK. Sometimes, sometimes, yeah. Got you, um, So yeah, so Yeah. Like maybe twice or twice a year, I do. OK. All right. I Yeah. Uh, I know a lot of the times, you know, uh, especially in Europe, you know, there is Wi Fi everywhere, so you may not necessarily need to do an international calling package, um, when you are traveling, um, because obviously if you have, if you have an iPhone, if you connected to the Wi Fi hotspot, you can always, you know, send your texts, iMessages, and things like that, um. Uh, so just, just food for thought there, you could save an additional $40 here when you, when you switch your mobile lines over and come over to Optimum Mobile. Uh, we, yeah, we also offer that discount on some of our other plans too, like if you were to do the $500 speed plan instead of the gig, you still qualify for that same offer but rather than a $40 discount, a $20 discount, so it is a little less, but you still could take advantage of that of that bundle, um, uh, feature there. OK. OK, oK. Alright. All right. Uh, that might be a better option then then I get, uh, you know, everything like you explained on the optimum, um, the of the uh of TV, the internet, and So yeah, so the, so the, yeah, so the, so your, so your optimum internet plan will be the internet, the X gig. The line. The um the dial tone for a phone or fax or whatever the case may be and the backup, uh, the backup modem, the connection back up for the TV you would just um there is no TV service, you just connect your TV to the Wi Fi you can stream Netflix, you can stream YouTube, you know, um, whatever, whatever streaming services, you know, you have uh Mhm. Yeah. Mm OK, OK. Oh, OK. Yeah, right, right, right, um. Um, so that is how that works. OK. Alright, so. All right, then you, what do you know what time they, uh, I mean, OK, so then if we talk about, yeah, like, yeah, go ahead. So it is up to you. So I have. So I, I have X different time slots for tomorrow. I have X a.m. to XX a.m. I have XX a.m. to X p.m. I have X p.m. to X p.m. XX a.m. to 2:00 p.m. would be better. OK, great. So, uh, uh, when I want to switch from my phone service to optimum. Mhm. When, when do I do that? Just, uh, get a, uh, you can do whatever you want, um so you can um Mhm. We can do it all right now if you want, you know, if you want to reach back out to me in a day or two, you can do that as well. I will send you an email. OK. I do not have, I do not have a direct con I do not have a direct phone number, so when you are ready to circle back and, and switch your phones over, just, uh, send me an email. Mhm.

If you decide to come over, they have to be unlocked so you may have to make a quick call to your current company with this AT&T and Verizon and make sure they are unlocked. If you are already with T-Mobile. Then you are good to go. OK. Uh, do you know Yeah, I know you know what? I have an insurance on my phone. I lost my PIN. Mhm. Uh, been dealing with it, you know, there is a pen in my Samsung phone. Mhm. So maybe I, I should get that. I pay insurance and never get a chance to. Yeah, so, yeah, so, so get, so get a new phone. Get that. I do not know. Um, and then, um. Mhm. And then after you get that new phone, just um. Reach out to me via this email, yep, OK, so hold on one second please. Yeah, like then touch, yeah.

[Customer] ""I bet yeah."" [Agent] ""OK. Alright, and what kind of business is this?"" [Customer] ""It is a gift shop."" [Agent] ""Gift shop excellent.

[Agent] ""Are you have TVs or anything streaming?"" [Customer] ""No, should not have, uh-huh."" [Agent] ""OK. Now do you have mobile for the business?"" [Customer] ""I do. Mhm."" [Agent] ""OK, uh, because, uh, who is your current carrier?"" [Customer] ""Uh, Verizon."" [Agent] ""OK, well, because we just teamed up with T-Mobile, so along with our network along with T-Mobile, uh, so what we are doing for business customers is if we bundle the, uh, mobile if you just add a tablet line, you do not have to change anything of yours if you do not want to You just simply add those we could give a discount So that is why business is expensive."" [Customer] ""That is why I try to offer offer everyone uh as much savings as possible, you know. OK, well. Uh huh I appreciate that I do, I already have one right now, mhm Alright. Alright, perfect. Alright, so I am going to need to generate a four digit access code for the account. Uh, it can not be like XXXX XXXX or anything like that, uh, but you just something you will remember. Uh-huh. OK, oK, uh, let us make it XXXX. OK. Alright, should be good, OK. So is this your first business? Um, no, I actually have another one. OK, just say it did not seem like your first rodeo. OK, now. So how much do you have optimum there as well? Uh, no, um, it is in a different town. Oh, OK, and how much are you paying for internet there? Mm. Uh, you know what, I do not know because it is actually a Hallmark store and they, they take care, yeah, they, they contract all that out with internet and their security services and all that kind of stuff, yeah, and the phone. OK. Got you. OK. You know this one's different and it seems a bit more of like a mom and pop. Are we doing internet and phone are we getting a main line there as well you can do everything via mobile Being mobile at least for right now. Yeah. I Exactly now how big is the space? I will see how it goes. Uh, it is about. Well, that is a good question. It is about, it is got two little spaces or big space in a smaller space, so you want a total space, uh, that the total space that the store is in, I am guessing is about. OK. XXXX square feet. OK, so it is a little bigger than I thought. XX to XX. OK, well, I just want to make sure I have enough coverage, you know what I mean? Yeah. so I want to know like, so like if you are in the back of the store, you know, you still have Wi Fi type of deal you know what I mean Well, yeah. Exactly. Yes, I do. And the other question I, I have for you is that this is actually a two-story building, um, and the second story is just empty and it is not part of the business or anything like that. Mhm. It is just an empty space. OK. But will that impact um the ability to get a good signal? No, no, it should, it should not affect anything really what happens with these if it is like concrete walls that'll affect it, things like that you should, you should be fine, especially you are on one floor OK. OK It is really, yeah, I just want to make sure you have enough. That is why what I was going to suggest like a XXX internet is like basically like small office like. One person in office, I was going to say go in the middle with the $500 because uh you are not doing any gaming or anything like that but at least you have the options if you want to play music or something like that, you know, the $500 will cover that whole that whole space and the $500 by itself it is only $105 a month goes to $100 even once you do the auto pay. OK. Sure. Oh, OK, so it is $100 a month, yes, uh. And most importantly, Yes. But most importantly it is going to keep your point of sale, you know, from, you know, timing out or anything like that, you know what I mean? Most importantly, you know, keep things moving functional in the store. Yeah, and what kind of, um, well, you know if you can answer this or not, but when there are disruptions of service, is it easy to get a hold of somebody and how does that work because I know the local office here just handles residential. Well, it is very much. Yes, well, with us business takes precedence without them. So if there is an outage, you know, we are coming to you guys first, you know, we also have, uh, an emergency connection backup. OK. Uh, it is a, it is like an LTE system, uh, so if your internet goes out, if this kicks on, keeps you up and running, uh, very much like how your, uh, your mobile phone goes from like Wi Fi to data, that is what this does, and this will keep you up and running in case like there is bad weather, something like that. Mhm. OK, oK. And that is part of the service that you are talking about. No, that is, that is an additional one that was $30 a month, so that would be on top of this because that is a separate device. OK, yeah, I think Yeah, I understand. um, and let let me ask you this too, if I already have a router. Mhm. Do, can you use my router do I have to use optimum Uh, no, you can use it. Well, the one we are going to bring you is it is a modem router and all in one. I mean if you would not choose to use a router from that, that is up to you then you will have everything right there in the one device from us OK, um, and I know that, um, I, will I need any other, I, I am this is I am not an IT person so like I know how to I know how to operate my phone Well, ask away. I want to make sure you are good. OK, so will this reach up the back room OK? or is there. Are there other things I have to have to make that? From what you told me that that is that is why I said to go with the XXX speed like that the bigger bandwidth from what you told me this should reach your your space just fine. Work on the back OK. All right. OK, so what was your name again? But there is no contract. My name is Jared Nichols , but just so you are aware, there is no contracts OK. So if you need to upgrade or anything, you could do that any time. All right. So what I usually suggest, absolutely if you need, if you decide, hey, say your business goes viral, you need to add mobile phones, you need to upgrade to a gig, you know, you need whatever you need, you can send I will be your single point of contact, so I will email with you so you will not have to call in you know go through the whole thing all over again Or I can switch service or. OK. Mhm. OK. All right. Do you have access to your email now? OK. Do I have access to email? Yes, and what was your name? Are you going to send me something with your name on it? Yep, I am going to email you right now because I, I do not have a direct line so I am going to just email you because that is the best way to do it and it is my name right on there too. OK, oK. And so how long um this uh $100 a month that you quoted is that is your best price for the $500? Yes, so that is the best one. That is good for X years, even though, yes, there is no contract, and if you have with everything with iPhone too, you know, if you have a good pay history, they will always extend any everything. For X years. They are very good with it, um. OK. Yeah, they are very, very uh customer friendly. And how Like what kind of timeline once I make this decision are we looking at as far as installation? Well I am going to tell you right now just to make sure because what I suggest with everyone is just to make sure we do not lose the promo then so we do not lose time yeah I always put in for at least a tentative uh install date just so we do not lose the time because I only have one space available now for Friday and then we are into Monday OK, and you are talking about this Friday. So on the day Yeah, which would also I have time out there. I know you said if, if we are not there I could push it out a week or two, not a problem at least this way we will not have to do everything all over again, you know what I mean We are all set up. OK, and is Is there a cost for installation? There is a one time installation fee for $100 that I was going to. Do they ever waive that? And that is rolled into the bill. Not, not on that usually on the install because it costs us to roll a truck as well. So that is what to say. Say that again. It, it also costs us to roll, uh, roll a truck and get you installed as well. So it is, I mean, if we set this up, you know, now and, you know, put it out I can always put in a request for the supervisor to see if that is something I can get waived. OK, so. I mean I have no, it would not, you know, no harm in sending a message. And if I, OK, and if they can not waive it and if I choose not to have it installed, is there any problem with that? No, that is why, that is why I emailed you already. So that is why I say if we put it in, say for next week or the week after and you say you change your mind, simply email me and we will make the adjustments. OK. That is not a problem. OK, um. So it would be safe if you want to just put in for the 18th just to hold the space because we only have one spot on all these these days. Well, I am, I am I am trying to think if it is been hard lately, um, today is the 8th, is that correct? OK. This is Tuesday 19 10th, so you are talking about Friday the 11th Is there a time frame slot? XXXX to X is the window. OK, let me look at my calendar. Can I? Hold on please. Absolutely sure. Well, unfortunately I have an appointment at XX o'clock on Friday that will probably last a couple of hours. OK, oK, yes, so that puts us in that puts us in Monday, no problem Monday is the same XX to X window Um, OK, hold on, let me double check Monday just a second. Not sure. That should work. I, I have an appointment at 9:30 in the morning. It will last an hour and it will take me an hour to get to Aurora from there, so there is no way I could get here before about noon. OK. So that is what I was going to tell you on the recap because so for we are going to do the gig internet now let us see it is $105 a month goes down to $100 with the auto pay one time installation fee of $100. So if they. Now on the Monday for that $112 window, about a half an hour before the techs and the call XXX-XXX-XXXX let you know they are on their way. Yeah. Well, the problem is if they call me at 10:30 to be here at XX, I can not be here. OK, so I am going to call. You see what I am getting you. I am putting out um, I just put call one hour before I just put in the notes in right now. Uh, OK, and that might work if again if they come call at XX, I can not be here until noon is what I am getting at. Yeah, well, that is what you got to tell them tell them right there on the call and they will make the adjustment. So if they come. OK, so that would work. Alright, so we are talking about the potential for installation on Monday for XXX, whatever that. Mhm. Mhm. X megabits, yeah, XXX megabits, yes, yeah. Measurement is OK for $100 a month, is that right? Yeah, XXXs XXX goes to XXX once you do the auto pay. OK. They give you $5 off doing auto pay. OK, so Well, yeah, well, I will start without the autopay, OK? OK, no problem. Because I do not, I want to make sure that is going to work before I do that because it is hard to undo autopay sometimes and um and then you will see about waiving installation since we are scheduling today, right? Of course. Yes, so I am going to I will send a message. Yeah we once I put everything into the system, I could send a message. Uh-huh. OK. That would be great. Alright, so we can do that now did you get the email from me? Oh, let me look. I am on the phone, so hold on. Not yet. Well, it did not get sent back to me, so let me double check. No, it did not come through. OK, let me double check, make sure I did not spell something wrong. Uh uh. Hit send receipt on my end. OK. So I am kind of famous sometimes I will leave the and off on the dot com and just write dot CO. And you spell your last name again for me one more time. Yeah, my name is Vivian V I V I A N B R U N E R at Yahoo.com. OK, so I did have it right. And there is no numbers or anything after it is just your name? Mm mm, just my name. OK. What was your name again though? Jared Nichols, that is who the email is going to come from. It is going to come from Jared. Nichols at Optimum.com. OK, I will work again. No, it is not there. Mm. It downloaded the boatload of them, but it is, there is no sharing in there. Mhm. Yeah, I put I just put the account number and optimum on there Let me, let me just. Mhm And so I am going to put this through so we are good for the Monday uh now just before we lose the space. OK. And then you are going to get another email from Optimum outlining everything. So you have the personal greeting for me then you will get another one from Optimum OK. OK. Nothing has come through yet. Very interesting. So not definitely not getting kicked back on my end, which is which is important. There it came. There is one from you. Yeah, perfect. Alright, so then that is the best way. OK, so what did you say again? I am sorry I had the phone away from my ear OK, so that is the best way to get a hold of me so now you got that. So if you have any questions, simply email me and we will go from there. OK. OK, and will you let me know before Monday if they are going to waive installation? Yep, I am going to send a message on it now. OK, that would be great, um is there anything else you need from me, Jared at this time No, that is it. Nothing, nothing out of pocket. All right. Everything's in the bill so you are good to go All right. I appreciate your help. Thank you. Alright you have a great day. You do the same. You too bye bye. Bye-bye."""

[Agent] ""I want to make sure we get you set up properly."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Mhm."" [Agent] ""OK, now I am also going to need a X digit access code that you will remember when you call in to protect the account."" [Customer] ""Um, uh, XXXX."" [Agent] ""Alright, so we are just doing, so we are just doing Internet. OK And I will be paying for internet at the other, uh, at your other areas."" [Customer] ""Um, I just have home internet.

[Customer] ""Um, well, I have had, I had the business at another location actually around the corner from where I am now, but they provided the internet."" [Agent] ""OK Got you. Understood. Alright, so, so very so with this one, you know, if you are just doing, I would suggest you are going to have that many people potential with phones or even logging into the internet or, you know, you are going to have, uh, you are going to have phones, you are going to have laptops, your wireless printers, cameras, you know, once you have all that connected, it is best to go with probably the gig speed internet."" [Customer] ""Mhm OK, um, that is kind of a lot."" [Agent] ""The gig speed internet with one phone line is only XXX a month. It goes down to XXX once you do the auto pay. Yeah, no contracts or anything."" [Customer] ""OK, alright, so you said XXX a month?"" [Agent] ""So that and that price is good for X years. Yeah, XXX $120 when you do the auto pay one time installation fee of $100 which is rolled into the bill."" [Customer] ""OK, and the OK, and how soon could they get it installed?"" [Agent] ""I am going to get you. I am getting to that page right now. Waiting for that to open up now on the day on the day of install it is best for them to call the XXX-X number?"" [Customer] ""Because I Yeah"" [Agent] ""OK Now also with this, if you bundled a mobile or a tablet line I can give you a $40 discount on the price of the Internet."" [Customer] ""Mm, but how much would a, a tablet or mobile be? how much would that add to the bill?"" [Agent] ""Well, well, it depends on what plan you whether you bring a device you already have or you get a new one, you know, so they have obviously new iPhones."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""They, they have even affordable phones or some like X to $6 a month, um the lowest plan is like $15 a month So you would have another line for the business as well. But then most importantly you still save on the bill."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""We we live in, you know the tri-state area Everything's expensive you know what I mean I try to get, you know, mention all the savings you can get it."" [Customer] ""Right, right, right. I might, I actually, I, I might actually take you up on that affordable phone."" [Agent] ""Yeah, then we do that like I think they have one's like a Motorola, Samsung, either one of them, and it is actually, uh, it works out great, you know, and then like you said, you have another line for the phone."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, so one of the staff members there. Mhm."" [Agent] ""I, I actually did get someone there tomorrow."" [Customer] ""Right. Oh perfect."" [Agent] ""OK I, I have X windows before them."" [Customer] ""Um, could it be before because I do not see patients and so forth. I could, uh, X o'clock if you could get someone there tomorrow tomorrow morning, tomorrow morning is perfect."" [Agent] ""I have X to XX and XX to X for the Windows."" [Customer] ""Mhm. We will take, we will take X to XX."" [Agent] ""XX OK. OK, so just in a recap, so you are getting the the X gig internet with the one phone line's $125 a month. It goes down to $120 with the auto pay."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""There is a one time installation fee of $100 rolled into the bill."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""The tech is going to come tomorrow."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""The X to XX is the window. About XX minutes, half an hour before arrival, they are going to call XXX-XXX-XXXX.""

[Agent] ""All right perfect yeah it looks like we have services available for you guys um."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So it is yeah, so we have many options, right We offer TV, phone and internet. Uh, what services were you interested here at this location?"" [Customer] ""Um, the, the, the least expensive one for now because it is my first time opening a business, so I do not, internet is definitely number one."" [Agent] ""Mhm Yeah, definitely, um, now how many phone lines?"" [Customer] ""Phone, definitely TV I am debating about, but if that is part of the deal, I will go with, but very high speed internet for sure. X."" [Agent] ""Just one? OK, alright, so you do get a discount, OK um, I will give you a price with internet and TV Uh, and phone and one with just the internet and the phone."" [Customer] ""Mhm"" [Agent] ""Um, with the TV, it varies, right?"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""The price, it all depends on the channels that you go with. Are you interested, like just the basic channel line up or are you interested in something that has a little bit more than news and sports?"" [Customer] ""Um, just the basic, you know."" [Agent] ""Alright, perfect."" [Customer] ""Maybe I may not need TV, you know, I may not need TV because it is a business and it is."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so I will, yeah, I will give you, yeah, I will give you a price for both, and um, yeah, you could decide which one you think would be better, uh, so with the discount I can get you, uh, you would get the highest internet speed which is the X gigabyte and the phone line, all equipment and fees, everything included, uh, you are looking at a monthly rate, it is going to be about, let me see, uh, are you going to do automatic payments?"" [Customer] ""OK. Um, yeah, I should."" [Agent] ""OK, alright, all equipment and fees, everything included, it is a monthly rate of XXX a month."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Total."" [Customer] ""1:30 a month. OK."" [Agent] ""And if you go ahead and add the TV."" [Customer] ""Um"" [Agent] ""Yeah, so with the TV, all the equipment and fees, it comes out to XXX. So it is about $65 to have that TV."" [Customer] ""Oh no, definitely not. Yeah, cause I am not going to be, you know, I was just, it, it was part of the bundle, I probably would have TV is not a necessary thing and knowing how these kids are just fucking"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""If they are there, cause I only have one little one."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Yeah, everybody streams nowadays."" [Customer] ""Yeah, so I am into video games and stuff, but TV is not, I mean, uh, internet, I am sorry, the TV stations are not really a thing that they are looking to do, cause half the time in my house, I, they barely look at TV. I am just seeing them doing everything else but watching regular channels."" [Agent] ""Right, yeah, no, that is true."" [Customer] ""So that may not work for me."" [Agent] ""Yeah, and you could always add it later if you need to."" [Customer] ""Um, Yeah, I probably can have it if needed. I probably would, um I am more interested in having the internet with the high speed internet and the telephone line And uh so my question is um I am looking to open business May 1st, correct?"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""I mean, um I am looking to open um this May 1st, so I am going to do my my warning of course I want to have a phone number in there So do I have to wait till May 1st to do all the installation and stuff for it to be activated, or how does it work?"" [Agent] ""Um, yes, so when the tech goes out there and deactivates the modem, you know, that is when they start billing you, uh you do not pay anything today to the tech They are going to generate a bill cycle and send you the bill later with the due date. That is when you get the phone number."" [Customer] ""Mm. Mhm. Oh, OK, so I mean my business is going to start on May 1st. Is there any way that they can install? Or no?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, definitely, yeah, what, what day do you think?"" [Customer] ""It I go to that."" [Agent] ""Yeah, what day do you think would be best to send somebody there?"" [Customer] ""Um, well, I do not have anything there, um, right now, no computers, nothing, so of course I have to set those things up first before I actually, um, have you guys installed I was wondering, um"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""I do not know I could do the phone number because I probably have to do it after."" [Agent] ""Yes, so, um, what I recommend, right, is, um."" [Customer] ""Mm. Mhm."" [Agent] ""Your your business officially opens the grand opening is May 1st?"" [Customer] ""Correct."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so I would recommend like have the installation like a week in advance. You never know. let us say something goes wrong you know, you just want to be safe"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I always recommend have it done like a little bit earlier."" [Customer] ""Mhm. But would I be billed for that last month for the whole month of April?"" [Agent] ""No, they, they, they bill you. So let us say for example, um, you get the installation on April 24th, that is literally only one week before May 1st, um, you know they generate a bill cycle for you, so your, your billing would start on the 21st and end on the 21st."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Mm. Oh, I see. I got you."" [Agent] ""Mhm No, yeah."" [Customer] ""It is not on not on May 1st. OK, that makes sense. OK, I understand what you are saying."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""OK, um, so therefore I may have."" [Agent] ""Yeah, that is just an example you could always reschedule it also so let us say if you want to change it, you could always reschedule it."" [Customer] ""I see. OK, so let me, because I have the warning guy coming in to to redo the awnings, and of course I like have the phone number on there, so I would have to call in that with him and find out, you know, how long is that going to take and see if I can, you know, put those two together, like match it up, like, you know, get the installation and get the awning with the phone number listed because I do not want to start the awning and I do not have a phone number."" [Agent] ""Right, the, the reason, yes, so the reason is, um, you know, the number."" [Customer] ""To put on it."" [Agent] ""Is only XXX. Every company is like this. They can only guarantee it once it is installed and active and you make the test call and you know it is officially turned on because there is always that, you know, 0.1% chance that something could go wrong and the phone number has to be changed, you know, it rarely happens, you know, it is very rare, but it is a possibility."" [Customer] ""Yeah, OK. Mhm. Yeah, but I want to take that chance. I do not want to be that 1%."" [Agent] ""So we do not, yeah, yeah, we do not want to give you the phone number um and you know something happens so we always recommend you have the phone installed, make a test call, make sure it is working just so you could put on advertising or your sign and you know there is no issues."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Mhm. Yeah. OK, so, and this $130 is that the best you can do? Is it, and is it, you know, is it changed for, you know, per year? Is it fixed? How does that work?"" [Agent] ""Um, how long are you going to be here at this location? Do you know how long your lease is for?"" [Customer] ""Um, I am, it is like a more month to month, so it is going to be from what I have told is like they, they are locking me in for like about X years."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""And um hopefully, you know, we will continue um unless they sell the building."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Oh, OK. Yeah, I can make it for X years. The price guaranteed for X years, and, uh, before the X years is up, you would just call us and get a new promotion, but we are on a month to month also, so you could always cancel or change it at any time."" [Customer] ""OK. OK, alright, so, and this is the, is it, do you have a direct number or is that I have to call back the X-XXX number and uh. Go through the post for you again or do I have a case number?"" [Agent] ""Um, so when are you looking to, uh, submit an order to have it saved because you could save everything now like I said, you could always change the appointment"" [Customer] ""Um, Um, let me see, because it is not, I, because I want to finish a tax season, so I know I have a couple of days my head is like so screwed up, not that your problems, mine, but um, let me see"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""If I can get because I have to get all the furniture in and all that stuff too, shit."" [Agent] ""Yeah, because I can, yeah, because I can, uh, yeah, because I can help you out, right? I have a free installation, it is, it is worth $100 available for today and I, I can save it for you guys you could always change the appointment, you know at least you have the free install saved"" [Customer] ""Well, I do not have anything there, not even a piece of equipment in there, so, um, if I look to do the installation, I could probably do that maybe on the 24th."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Yeah, or you could do it, you know, the week of the of the 1st you could do it like a day or two in advance, you know, you could always change it or reschedule it at least you have the offer saved for you"" [Customer] ""Yeah, the reason is because of the awning. That is why I am concerned because I need to get a phone number in there. That is my problem."" [Agent] ""Oh, OK."" [Customer] ""So I do not want to um, I do not want to Um, do it on the May on May, and business is open with someone else's phone number in their business contact."" [Agent] ""Right, right, yep. Yeah, totally understand. Yeah, so I just need a little bit of info."" [Customer] ""Um, Yeah."" [Agent] ""I will, I will save it for you. Um, I used to need the company name."" [Customer] ""Um, would be HHS. Accounting services."" [Agent] ""Mhm"" [Customer] ""Now, when you pass by you are not going to be there because you are wanting to so I am not there until May 1st."" [Agent] ""Yeah, yeah, no, we are not going to send anybody there now it is just uh to save everything for you, um."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And it is H for Harry, H for Harry, S for Sierra, accounting services."" [Customer] ""Correct.

[Customer] ""Um, Yeah, I have to talk to my husband first because he is the one that is taking care of all of that. He just told me to make a phone call, so I am just doing that."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""If you can give me a number which I can call back I could schedule, I would say attentively the 24th, but just not confirmed yet because I have nothing there I have no furniture.

Yeah, that will be the mailing address as well. Alright, and then. The XX on invest over there? For this account we have to create a X digit pin number. We call this an access code when you call in we have to verify it. What would you like your X digit access code to be? Mhm. It is XXXX. XXXX OK. Alright, so now I just want to ask you some questions regarding how you are using the service to make sure I get you a plan that fits those needs and helps your business grow. Mhm. As far as the internet goes, what type of devices are you connecting to the internet? So it is going to be registered, like, you know, it is in the store. Mhm. So it is going to be POS registers, pumps will be connected to that, a computer. I said two computers, uh, locking machines, stuff like that. So, yeah. OK, so registers, uh, plural like multiple registers. Uh, right now it is one register. But in the future you will have a couple more. Uh, one latte. Yeah, so let us say you can do X registers, lottery machines, couple of computers, uh, DVR system. All right. Any cameras? Uh, Uh, we have a separate connection for that. OK, um, any TVs in like a break room or office or, or in the sitting area or no? No. No, OK. And how are your customers going to just a couple of computers, OK, how are your customers getting in contact if they, if they need to reach out to the store? OK a couple of computers. Are they just walking in or are they making, are they calling in or how are they getting in contact? So we will like to have our telephone. OK. You know, like a phone number? I got you. Is it just one that you are needing or multiple? Just one. Just one? OK, let me see what deals we have going on right now. Just bear with me one second, OK? Uh Mhm. You said just one number. And let me see what this does. Can you hear me talking to myself, Mr. Sam, just do not judge me, right? You are fine you are fine Just do not judge me. I do. And then You sound busy when you called in. I deal with that all day long. There was a ton of background noise. You sound super busy. Yeah I mean we we are in process of like construction and getting this thing done so I am just running back and forth from the inside and out of the building Oh. Well, I see that it used to be like a Valero. Hey, I mean, the best, best advice we can get is, yeah, so the best advice we can get is from ourselves, right? so. I see this used to be like a Valero. What changes are you trying to make to it? Are you trying to expand it or what is going on? So it is still going to be over there, but uh the building was really small when we got it and it was closed so we did. Huh? Expanded the billing, made it bigger. It is small. I see it on Google. That is a small building. Oh my gosh, you can not even turn around in that building. Oh, no, that, that is yeah that is the problem I mean. Yeah, this one, no, not, not anymore, yeah, we have. It is like double or triple the size now, so. Yeah Good because you can not even turn around at all in that store that is small. Yeah, it was really, really, really small win about it. I It is a good area though. So, but now it is like. Yes it is super busy. Alright, let me see what we have going on with our promotions with the with the bundle deal. And so, Um, I also do want to get you a backup internet connection as well that way you can still process payments if there is ever like any maintenance going on on the lines in the area. Mhm. OK. So let me see what that looks like, um. Mhm Yeah, because we can not afford like interruption of the internet because all of, uh, all of our credit card transactions and everything there. Oh With this, with this traffic area, I, I believe it like you are, you are in the main part of this road, so I understand. Yeah. Um, so we do have a one gig on special. Um, so if you have POS machines, if you have cell phones, if you have multiple computers, the lottery system, DVR system, and then some connecting, um, you do not have to worry about the bandwidth, um, being overloaded, dropping, you do not have to worry about that. Mhm. It is a X year promotion. Mhm. There is no contracts. Um, it does give you a backup connection in where if there is any maintenance on the lines or any outages detected in the area, it will automatically boot up to a wireless connection that way you can still process payments until that issue is resolved and you get that dedicated voice line that the tech will provide on site. Mhm. It was XXX, but I was able to put a discount on here and get it down to XXX with auto pay or XXX without auto pay. OK, so, uh, how the backup, uh internet works? So like we have to switch to the wireless or turn on the wireless device or how that works? So you do not have to do anything. If there is an outage due to whatever reason in the area, um, then the system will automatically boot up to it and once the issue is resolved, it will go back to your main source of internet. Mhm. But you do not have to do anything. OK, got you. And uh No, you good. How soon were you, I am sorry. How soon were you needing to have the service installed? As soon as possible. Oh, OK, well, no pressure, thanks. Mhm. Because I know we still have like a couple of weeks ago. OK. You know, Let us see what we can do. Uh, for to start the store. So, but if we get the internet, then, you know, I know next week our lottery guys will be here so they can work properly, so. OK. We, the earliest date that we have in Terrell, Texas is showing Monday the 14th we have Tuesday the 15th Monday the 14th, it is then. Monday the 14th, now there is going to be a standard install fee, um, that is standard, it is $100 but that is billed out if you do take care of the first payment in the month of service though, you do get a $10 credit on your next bill. Mhm. Did you want to take care of that today? OK. Uh, what I can take. Can I take care of it on Monday? Like because I always have my bank accounts and everything for the company. Yeah, you Yeah, yeah, if if you make the payment before the tech comes out installed, you get a $10 credit on your next bill. If not, then it is just billed out to you. You are, you are fine. You are good. Yeah, just just just just bill out to me. That is it, because I know I have so many files in the phone. OK. If I start looking for my bank confirmation right now for the store, it is going to take me a minute. Mhm You are fine. I will not do that to you. You are fine. Um, one other thing before I submit this um you get an email confirmation Um, we do offer mobile service for business if you have mobile service currently like everyone else you switch over, you can save an additional $40 off your internet Would you be interested in that? So here is the thing. Mhm. So, I just moved from Indiana and I have my Indiana number XXX, so nobody answered my call here because they think that is a spam call. Oh. So what if I want to add like a cell phone line, like a Texas number to it? Yes. It is a brand new number. If you want to, if you want to add a brand new number and, um, and if you do not need a device, it is just $45 a month for unlimited talk, text data and X gigabytes of mobile hotspot, um, we actually do have a promotion we get two lines for the price of one, the two lines for $45 and then you also get $40 off the internet. So what, what is? Mhm. Mhm. Uh, I will be, I will be good with this one line. OK, then yeah, it is just $45 but then you also get $40 off the internet, so essentially it is just $5. Uh, a month with taxes. And what about the phone? Like, obviously I will need to on the phone if I want to add it up, add this one on. Um, It it depends on what type of phone you want. Do you want like an iPhone do you want a more affordable, um, and expensive phone What iPhones are there that we can get? Uh, we have we have an iPhone Let me go to it. Give me one second. Let us filter by Apple. We have a special on our iPhone XXE. Um, normally it is $600 a month, but with this promotion, give me one second, let me make sure it is not trade in required. Mhm. No, that is a trade in. So it is going to be $600 full payout, but if you want to finance it, it is as low as $16.64 a month on top of the monthly total. OK, and like if you want to go for XX Pro or something like that? Yeah, we have, um, XX $1000 for the phone if you buy it out. If you finance it, it is as low as $27.75 and there is no interest on the prices that I am quoting you either. Um, we also have the iPhone XX Pro Max as low as $33.31 with financing or an iPhone XX Plus, um, as low as XXXX cents with financing. So for financing, like, do I, do we have to pay anything today or? Um, more than likely you will have to pay the taxes on the phone, um, and then a $20 activation fee, but that is it. Mhm. So, let me get back on that one, you know, like if I want to add a line of phone, uh, then I can always do it, like, or do I have to do it today? Mhm. Yes. You can always do it. I will email you the promotions that we have that way you can look it over and then decide from there and if you want to move forward with it, just let me know I will coordinate a time to call you back OK. Yeah. Um, but let me do this full recap for you that way I can submit it and get this over to you, um. OK. Now if you do not enroll with auto pay today it is going to be $5 more when you receive the email, but once you do enroll in autopay, it is just $5 back to what I quoted you, OK? OK. Um, so we are going to be set up service for um XXXX Westmore Avenue, Carroll, Texas XX,XXX. Mhm. It is going to be a X gig special has your Wi Fi modem router combination with the backup connection, internet, and it has one dedicated voice line that the tech will provide on site. Mhm. It is $185 a month or $180 if you sign up for autopay after you have been installed with a one-time setup fee of $100. Mhm. It is billed out for you. We will have it on schedule for Monday the 14th between XX and X, and I will have your cell phone number XXX-XXX-XXXX in the comments for the tech to call ahead of time if they have any issues with locating the property. Yeah. Mhm. OK. How does that sound? Oh, that sounds super. Alright I will see you talking about we have already discussed it. You are fine. Alright, so I have this on schedule for you. Yeah. I will send you an email as well just with the mobile discounts if you want to move forward, let me know, but if you have any questions about the install, just reach out to me via email I will coordinate a time to call you back, OK Mhm. Mhm. Oh, I. Alright, thank you, Mr. Sam. You enjoy the rest of your day, OK? Thank you for choosing A one. All right. Thank you so much, ma'am. Mhm. Mm bye bye. Bye bye."""

And being that you rely on internet service for your home source and your business source, you also have what we call the backup internet too as well. So there is any outages with the internet there in that particular area, it is it is going to automatically switch over uh to the backup internet, which is a cellular internet. And then once the issue is resolved, it is going to automatically switch back for you."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So you technically do not have to do anything. At that point, but this ensures that you have internet throughout."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""There is no contracts, OK."" [Customer] ""Now OK, I know, I understand. I am sorry to cut you off. So the reason I am. Uh, considering canceling Verizon is, um, when I first built the home. Um, there, I have, because I have several TVs I have surveillance, I have Stereos, there is a rack that Controls my. Um, my TVs, my cameras, my networks, um, throughout the house, so one thing that they had done, the company that installed, um, and we were never able to actually be able to connect the Verizon router."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""To Where I would be able to use, say for instance my cameras there was always an issue um if I called up Verizon technical support um to find out exactly"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""You know, I was going through issues they would say listen we can not even see that, um."" [Agent] ""Oh wow."" [Customer] ""We can not even see you have yeah, we can not even see that you have service So I bought my, my, my tech guys over here, they switched it over, um, you know, to the Verizon router, then, you know, there was issues with my alarm."" [Agent] ""Uh, do not worry about that."" [Customer] ""There is always issues with the internet there is also always issues with the TV"" [Agent] ""Something mhm."" [Customer] ""The TV freezes like quite a bit."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Um, I do not know what that issue is, um I have had technicians over here And it just continues to stay status quo, so it is good that you know I mean yeah it is a big headache so now I know from you guys um you guys do not use uh TV boxes correct?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, sounds like a headache. Well, with this program that I am signing you up for is going to be the Internet service. Um, so you can stream on those TVs."" [Customer] ""Oh"" [Agent] ""And um and then what I could do for you, uh, this is going to also in this package that I have you with comes with our protection plan so everything what you just said is going to be covered so you are going to have a private number to call."" [Customer] ""OK. Mhm."" [Agent] ""So if there is ever any issues with with a particular device not working you know with some settings like you said like your cameras or your TVs, you would have a private number to call for actual help for that and if we need to go out there and assist you, we will we will go out there at no cost to you."" [Customer] ""OK. Mhm mhm. Got it. Now, as far as because I just know from my father-in-law has Optimum and he used to have a box and he went and turned his, you know, he only had one TV but or two TVs he went and turned the box"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""In and got some other device that is behind his. TV and now he just is able to stream all you know all channels is that the same thing?"" [Agent] ""So right now I got you settled with just internet service so there is no actual TV cable slash I, I, I think, I guess I misunderstood you on that, Mr."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Williams."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Um, I thought maybe you were just looking for internet service. I can add uh a pack."" [Customer] ""No, no, I am looking for both. I am looking for both."" [Agent] ""OK, so."" [Customer] ""I mean, obviously, my internet is, is very important I need to have fast internet"" [Agent] ""Very Absolutely, and I got that covered."" [Customer] ""Um, because I do, I do a lot of, yeah, you know I do a lot of Zoom calls"" [Agent] ""Yes."" [Customer] ""I do, you know, quite a few, um, meetings, Zoom meetings on, on online, so I do need like what is the fastest that you provide?"" [Agent] ""I got you with the X gig which is the fastest there."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Yes, sir."" [Customer] ""Um, so what, so now, now, yeah, so what are we talking about with TVs?"" [Agent] ""As far as your. With the TV services, um, each TV would have to have a cable box. Um,"" [Customer] ""Really?"" [Agent] ""Yes, sir. If you, if you did not want that, then I am sure it sounds like your TVs are smart TVs, so then you can just download the apps on those TVs yourself. And help with that in that private."" [Customer] ""So is it do not you guys provide, are not you guys doing away with the, the, the TV boxes because I remember I call or or is that only um that is not a business account that is a. That is a personal account because I, I remember when I called in about a month ago they did say listen you only need one box then the rest you can stream"" [Agent] ""Was Mhm. Mm That is not quite true. The, the you need that has the box is going to get you all the channels then the streaming is just something like a just like a different service, so you can still stream You can download Paramount, ESPN Plus, uh, Netflix, whatever you want."" [Customer] ""But what I am trying to do is minimize like, you know, I want to be able to go on and just get every channel, you know, from one."" [Agent] ""Right. Right."" [Customer] ""You know, I know they have that, you know, in in the city it is Spectrum they have that because I have several apartments in the city that there is no boxes it is just strictly, you know, I log on to the account I can bring up cable service"" [Agent] ""Understood. Uh, so, no, that is not offered on the business side. Um, I believe what you are talking about is, um, they call it, uh, TV on the go. So like you can uh download it on like on your phone. And then you can stream it to your TV. So you will sign into your account."" [Customer] ""Yeah, no, I am not looking to do that."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""So what do they offer on the residential side?"" [Agent] ""I each TV would have to have a box and then you will have the app where it is TV on the go."" [Customer] ""So what does my father-in-law have then?"" [Agent] ""Or you can stream Um, what is his address so I can check it out."" [Customer] ""He does not have a box. XXX Daisy Road in Manito."" [Agent] ""XXX Daisy Road. What is the zip code there?"" [Customer] ""Correct in Madison XXXXX."" [Agent] ""H"" [Customer] ""Um and. You Yeah"" [Agent] ""Appreciate your patience. It will be just another moment."" [Customer] ""Yes"" [Agent] ""Alright, here we go. So yeah, he has TV services he has equipment he has a box"" [Customer] ""He definitely does not have a box. I will tell you that for a fact. He just got all the uh equipment over there. You just put a TV on uh over his fireplace there is no box anymore like a box meaning."" [Agent] ""A physical, right."" [Customer] ""You know, a square box."" [Agent] ""Yes, sir."" [Customer] ""There is no square box there yeah there is nothing there anymore."" [Agent] ""I understand. Uh, maybe he has it behind the TV I do show he has equipment He is being charged monthly for it. $14 "" [Customer] ""Yeah, he does not have a box. I mean, unless it looks like like the hotspot, like a small like cube X by X, then if that is what you guys consider a box. Um,"" [Agent] ""We do not have a X by X."" [Customer] ""Because he does not have a box. There is got to be something that you have."" [Agent] ""I did not know."" [Customer] ""I mean, I am not making it up, you know what I mean?"" [Agent] ""No, no, you, I know you are not."" [Customer] ""Like, that is what I am trying to eliminate. I am trying to eliminate. The issues that I have right now and the issues, some of the issues right now that I have, I am not saying that I am against having boxes, but it is a lot easier if I am able to just stream."" [Agent] ""Right. If you did Mhm."" [Customer] ""I know from Spectrum in Manhattan they are able to do that. There is no boxes everything is based off of a, a modem"" [Agent] ""Whatsoever."" [Customer] ""Um, and you just log in, you turn the TV on, you log into an account the, the, the guide comes up, so everything is there Um, there is no individual apps that are downloaded, none of that kind of jazz, um."" [Agent] ""Understood."" [Customer] ""So, you know, I know for a fact my father-in-law does not have a box because of the fact that where the TV is, which is above the fireplace, um, there was no physical area for the TV uh for the box at all, um, because, um, Best Buy had told them, told him about this, and then he went and turned in his actual box he was able to get"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Um, it is just streaming. It is just streaming."" [Agent] ""I understand what you are saying."" [Customer] ""So I am kind of I am I am confused that you guys would not. Um, You guys, I mean, he has the same service so. You guys do not offer anything like that?"" [Agent] ""Correct."" [Customer] ""Nothing?"" [Agent] ""Correct."" [Customer] ""I, I, I do not know. It does not make any sense to me. So what, what do I, what do I, who do I speak to to, to find more about that? Maybe this is something that recently changed."" [Agent] ""I know there is nothing like this on the on the commercial side. I can get you over to the residential side, but I I assure you I show I show that he has a box on his account"" [Customer] ""Yeah, why do not you get me over."" [Agent] ""It is a mini box, but he has some sort of physical device, a mini box is what is what it is showing here, but he has it."" [Customer] ""I Oh, what is it? What is the What is the mini box?"" [Agent] ""It is a physical device that is attached to the TV. There is a HDMI cord, a power cord the cable line"" [Customer] ""OK, so it is the mini box."" [Agent] ""But it is still a box."" [Customer] ""So it it it is a X by X box, correct?"" [Agent] ""It is still equipment. No, it is not a X by X box, no sir, it is going to be bigger than that. I would say at least a XxX, something like that he still has a box"" [Customer] ""I mean, XX to"" [Agent] ""He still has a physical box."" [Customer] ""And how is that service run? How is that service run?"" [Agent] ""Uh, with the power, there is a power cord, there is a cable line and an HDMI cord, and that is how it is ran. And then it is, you know, it, it uses, uh, there is going to be online apps that you can download if your TV was not a smart TV."" [Customer] ""Yeah. Yeah."" [Agent] ""But there is still"" [Customer] ""And if it is a smart TV then what?"" [Agent] ""Then you just click the then you do not need to download any apps. That you just have the, the."" [Customer] ""So it works just as regular cable service."" [Agent] ""Exactly."" [Customer] ""And is that offered on the business side, the mini?"" [Agent] ""No, sir."" [Customer] ""Yeah It is not"" [Agent] ""Correct, it is not."" [Customer] ""And what is the reason behind that?"" [Agent] ""Probably because the functionalities, uh, with the business is going to be just straightforward, um, on the residential, the minis, there is apps, uh, it is going to be random using the internet."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Uh, so it just has more functionalities, more things that you can do."" [Customer] ""What on the residential side?"" [Agent] ""Correct."" [Customer] ""I am meaning what more can be done on the residential side? I am just trying to understand this to make it."" [Agent] ""I would have I would I would have to get you over there, um, I I do not I do not handle residential I do not, I, I can not set up an installation so I do not have the details."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""I can only help you with the commercial account."" [Customer] ""So what is better though? What is like as far as Internet obviously the Internet's coming from the same company, right? You guys are providing it whether it is business or residential, right? So you can get the one gig on the residential side. What makes the business different? I mean, it is just there is a business side and."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so Right, right, so the business has its own private line vers , and then the residential has their own line, so you are in a neighborhood, right So everybody in this neighborhood, uh, with the residential accounts has his own node meaning that is where the, the source is coming from and it is ran through the neighborhood and into the house."" [Customer] ""OK"" [Agent] ""So with the business side and again that is the, that is the traffic that is going to be on that line. So on the business side it is probably just going to be you. And so you have your own dedicated line so the the experience for you is going to be much faster for you. And it is more secure because it is going to be for a business set up."" [Customer] ""Got it. Mhm mhm mhm."" [Agent] ""And then of course uh diving into that even deeper uh you get to use uh a tax ID a EIN number for it at the end of the year for tax purposes you can use a business name yeah so right."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Yeah, I can write it off. Yeah, which is great. Alright, so tell me, tell me what, what is, uh, what is the, um, what is the services look for like on the TV? I mean, is it still, I mean you get a box, OK, fine, but is it still the same set up like as far as like channels so on and so forth the same or the availability or no"" [Agent] ""You Um, so, good question. So on the commercial side, what is not available is premium channels like HBO, Showtime, and Cinemax. It is not, it is not in that, yeah, it is not in that channel lineup, but you can still download those apps if you, if you wanted to."" [Customer] ""Yeah I do not need any of that. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course, um, OK, so what are we looking at as far as price point? I appreciate you explaining this all to me. I am, I am, I am new to the business side, but my accountant had told me, why do not you, you know, since you have so much going on at the house and you do a lot of business at the house, why do not you just use that, you know, you can write it off, so why not do it, you know, um."" [Agent] ""Yeah Exactly."" [Customer] ""So tell me uh about the TV."" [Agent] ""And then there is, there is, there is no, uh, also keep in mind there is no contracts, OK? So, uh, right, uh, so let us do it like how many TVs do you have total?"" [Customer] ""That is even better. So XX. X, so I have X downstairs, I think, wait, XXX, yeah, X downstairs and One is for, so X, yes, X TVs."" [Agent] ""X TVs, so each TV if you want to have the exact same amount of channels."" [Customer] ""Actually, actually, I am so sorry. I am so sorry. Add one more because there is one in the basement, X TVs."" [Agent] ""X TVs. So if you want to be, uh, so if you want if you want to have access like the same channel set up on, on, on all these TVs, um, like you know what you are used to to have a clicker, you, you would have to have X boxes."" [Customer] ""Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. Mhm."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""OK, that is no problem."" [Agent] ""Um, and then I."" [Customer] ""I do not care about the boxes, it is just I did not know if this is the reason why I am having so many problems, you know, with the current Verizon, you know, you would think, you know, everybody goes to Verizon and you know, the internet is so good it is, to be honest with you, excuse my French, it is shit, it is garbage and I pay a lot of money, you know, um, I do not know if it is because of the area I am in."" [Agent] ""Mhm"" [Customer] ""I remember when I first came in. Um, it took a little while for them to get in here I have, I have always had Verizon It was better in the city. Um, but I tell you it is been X years of a nightmare, to be quite honest with you."" [Agent] ""Hm."" [Customer] ""And especially, you know, with the internet too, you know, you hook up more than one device and then, you know, slows it down and then, you know, I can not access certain things and it is just a nightmare, so."" [Agent] ""Right. Um, so I am going to quote you with our preferred package which is the biggest package."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So you have, you have all the channels that is that is what I like to do uh with customers and then as time goes on if you want to down if you want to scale it down you can do it, you just call us and be like hey I only want these handful of channels and then we will see what channels um those uh those channels come on as far as the packages goes and then we can rearrange stuff like that unless you know right off the top of your head what what actual networks you got to have."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""I can I can match it up to the package that we have."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh. Now, um, most I would say like the basic channels I mean like, you know, obviously like all news channels like CNBC, Bloomberg TV things of that nature is that common"" [Agent] ""Yeah, so that is going to be like CNBC you said Bloomberg"" [Customer] ""Yeah, it is all like, you know, CNN they are all like on Verizon. I do not know what they are with, you know, um, Optimum, but like CNBC, so there is like a whole. I would say CNN, CNBC, NB MSNBC, Bloomberg, CSPN, CSPN X, CSPN X, like all these news channels like Fox Business, um, I need those."" [Agent] ""Understood, so that kind of puts you in the a step down from our preferred so I can do that for you."" [Customer] ""Now also wait XXX more one more, uh, and I definitely need my."" [Agent] ""So let me, uh huh. Uh"" [Customer] ""Um, my yes network, I do not know if that."" [Agent] ""Yeah, we got it."" [Customer] ""Come comes OK so that that comes OK perfect yeah other than that I mean you know I, I, we do not really watch premium channels I mean obviously you can not get them I will download them on the app um just tell me the difference in price from the premium package to the step down that you were just about to tell me."" [Agent] ""All right, cool, cool, cool. OK, one second. So it looks like there will be just a $15 difference, OK. So get you with that and then you said X. TVs."" [Customer] ""I am going to I am getting"" [Agent] ""OK, X TVs, X boxes."" [Customer] ""as well. Uh"" [Agent] ""Right So right now the TV alone is XXX."" [Customer] ""Just the TVs."" [Agent] ""Yeah, it is just the TV alone."" [Customer] ""Wow, expensive."" [Agent] ""And that is what our preferred and there will be a $15 difference, it will be $15 less with our with our value."" [Customer] ""Um,"" [Agent] ""Um, let me see if there is something I can do for you, William, OK? One moment."" [Customer] ""Yeah, no problem."" [Agent] ""You do you have a name for your business?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, of course."" [Agent] ""What is the name of your business?"" [Customer] ""It is called Vassilios. D A S I L I O U S. Advisors What is it? V A S I L. OS L IOS? I am sorry.""

[Customer] ""Yeah perfect."" [Agent] ""Alright."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""And ATVs, yeah."" [Customer] ""Let me ask you this, uh, is it based off of the boxes, the equipment itself, because there are only XX. X TVs out of the, out of the X that are used. I am just waiting to hook them up. I have to have my, my, um, so I do not know if that makes a difference, does it?"" [Agent] ""Oh, OK. It will, it will, yes sir, it will."" [Customer] ""Now would it be possible like when I, when I, when and if I decide to because they are in my kids' rooms and I am not getting they are you are very young so I am not going to be putting any boxes in there yet so um.""

[Customer] ""I mean, I guess just a basic just so when people come they can look at their registry to see what race they are in things like that we are all I mean we are only like I said we are we are, we are only race on Sundays and so we, you know, we are looking kind of because I could like something that we can shut it off in the fall and and and then when we are.""

[Agent] ""OK, so if you go with the X gig internet with one phone line, you would be looking at XXX a month. $115 if you go with the XXX speed you will get $20 off this price you would be looking at $95."" [Customer] ""OK. OK, and that is with one phone line too, the XXX it was it was like a half a gig."" [Agent] ""You have a gig correct."" [Customer] ""OK, so was that considered like the is that that that would be considered the basic?"" [Agent] ""Yes, I mean, uh, since it is a race thing and I know you mentioned only once a week, but since the difference is only $20 you can even think of going with the gig, but again that is your call, you know, if you want to start with $500 and later upgrade to gig you can do that also."" [Customer] ""OK. Yeah, yeah, no that that. OK, yeah, I just want to bring the options to the, the board because literally we are, we are there during the week but we are working and we only race on Sunday so like we would use it for, you know, us to set up the computer and we can get the race information from people and things like that and then literally after the season like our last race is the first weekend in November and then we are not there until, you know, we do not start racing again until the last weekend in April.""

We do not have the high speed with the fiber."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Right? And"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""And something's going on with the line outside. Something was going on with the line outside so tech came here yesterday Replace the uh replaced the wire, I guess the wire had some water damage done to it."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""And then With what he did. Um, One of the other offices in our building got knocked out. So now, someone came from Optimum just now to, to take care of their problem and knocked us out."" [Agent] ""OK, so your internet is out right now."" [Customer] ""So, like, uh, so our internet is spotty. It is like, it is not moving. It is not moving. Very, very slow and we are just like, we are we are we are we are we are we are."" [Agent] ""OK. Well you guys only have XXX you only have XXX megabytes Well, how many devices do you guys have connected to the Internet?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, quite a few PCs here. Quite a few PCs."" [Agent] ""Have you ever considered upgrading your internet?"" [Customer] ""Let us talk about it."" [Agent] ""Two things you are in a fiber capable area, so, you know, we offer speeds of up to X gig. How many, you said quite a few PCs. How many PCs?"" [Customer] ""XXXX maybe."" [Agent] ""You should definitely be on a gig. Your internet is probably, well, I understand. I see the water damage thing that they fixed You guys should be operating with a gig versus XXX megabytes"" [Customer] ""Alright, Rashaw, what do you got?"" [Agent] ""Give me one second, let me take a look."" [Customer] ""I am going to place you on a brief hold. I am not transferring anywhere. Just give me a few seconds. Let me take a look and see if there are any offers available for you, OK? I am here. I am here. Thank you. You are welcome hold on. Thank you for your patience, Gussie there. Hello? Sorry, I had you on mute. Sorry about that. No problem. So you do qualify for a promotion. Hey. You can upgrade to a gig right, which would take you fromXXX/XX to XXX,XXX Your area it is not a fiber area yet. Those points are unavailable you could still max out on your internet Um, services would include failover as well, which means if you have internet ever goes down, you know, it, it backs up so that you still have access for up to X hours and so it can come back up services include protection and support. It will be an additional $65. It is free for the tech to come out and swap out your modem. It is a XX month offer no contract is required That would fix everything, especially if you are running with XX PCs off of over XXX megabytes, your, your your spottiness is not going to go away, new equipment or not, you know tech visit fixes the wires, you are still going to experience that with that many devices on that little internet Oh, I only have X devices in my home and I am operating over XXX megabytes and that is, that is my house, let alone a business. OK. Got you. OK. I can have a I can have somebody out there tomorrow to to set it up. Oh And what do they do? There is no charge for the tech visit. Basically they are going to switch out your modem, right? and then give you a gig modem which is going to bump you up to XXXX megabytes instead of XXX megabytes. Mhm. It includes back up and support and includes protection and support, but it does require for you to get a new modem. OK. OK. Um, and what will our new bill look like? It will be a difference of $65. The new monthly rate instead of the $250 that you are paying right now it would be $315. The bump up to 3:15. Yes. OK. No contract. No contract XX month fixed rate, that is correct. Interminate at any time. You can upgrade, downgrade, cancel, or in different. There are no penalties. No penalties. What would you say XX months, you say that? It is a XX month fixed rate, which means your rate will be locked in for X years unless you unless you make a change. Oh Oh, X $65. There is no change in price for XX months. That is correct. It is a XX month offer. What will it go to after that? It is a promotional. It depends on what the discounts are. Um, they have a renewal option in X years, you could probably renew an option. They have a better deal, you know, you can enroll in that as well. Unfortunately we do not have a forecast of what the XXXX, XXXX deals are. They do not roll those out that early for us. Well, what, what could the potential, what could, what could it be potentially? Like, uh, potentially if let us just say if they give you a step up rate sometimes they will do like a step up offer which means they say, OK, well we are giving you this type of discount, you know, you are going to see a difference of $15 on your bill. Your bill goes up $15 or something like that or $10. Oh, something like that. OK, alright, OK. Yeah, it is not like they, they do not just rip the promotion away and then your bill jumps up $400 or something like that. That does not, that does not happen, but. OK, oK. And because it is not a contract, let us just say you do not agree with it, right? So So, wait a minute, so there is no fiber outside? You can upgrade, downgrade, cancel or different there are no penalties It is this new modem's going to be still coax? It will still be coax only because like as I am looking in your area, the fiber ports, there is fiber wiring out there, but they, it is not ready to go. You know it is not ready to go where they are like offering it where they could say, hey, give them a fiber deal otherwise I could give you the same deal with fiber. Fiber ports are not available at at the address as of yet which means that you would end up getting a failed install in That would be even more contiguous, of course. Oh, I do see the wire. I do see the wire out there the optimum guy told me the wire is right there Yeah, we get that all the time. Like on sales on the sales end, trust me when I tell you the techs are infamous for saying, yeah, the wires right here. Alright, alright. I know a guy who has fiber running all up his block. If it is not ready, it is not ready. The sales team knows when it is ready because it will tell you. Fiber only give this guy a fiber deal, you know, and then sometimes when we force the issue, right, because, you know, we do not want to disappoint the customer what ends up happening on the day of install when it is a 5th install, what does the customer do? OK. Mhm, mhm. Why do you guys have to waste my time and tech can not do it? and he said it is still not ready the thing or it is ready, you guys got to do something like I will go with take the gig when fiber is truly ready, they will start sending you direct literature. They will like Optimum will call you and say. Yeah Yo, you want to do fiber? Right. They will send it to you. Right Right. So do not always go by what these techs say because these techs say, you know, I am not saying that they do not know what they see, but they do not know what the offer grid is they just know I could plug this into that. Got you. OK. All right. Got you. OK, what is on, let us go. Alright, so I have tomorrow between XX and X or X and X, which, what time would work best for you? XX and X. What is the best number we can call we are on our way? Uh, my cell XXX. Mhm. XXX Mhm. XXXX I will have them call XX minutes before they um before they arrive, OK?

Call45,"[Agent] ""Thanks for calling Optimum for Business now offering Optimum Mobile. My name is Dina. How can I help you?"" [Customer] ""Hi Tina, my name is Kristen Antonelli. Um, I am calling from Capeli Salon. We currently use you guys for, um, our internet we do not use you for phone Um, we have been using Verizon. I do not really know why all the time we have been having issues with the phone lines so I wanted to look into if you guys do digital service, um, to maybe switch phone to you guys"" [Agent] ""Sure, like you are looking for like the actual handsets themselves."" [Customer] ""Well, yeah, I mean, we have handset, but I guess what I am trying to figure out is the issue we have been having with Verizon is I guess they keep telling us that we have like old copper wiring and that they keep, I mean, we have been losing our phone lines for days at a time, and they keep coming out to fix it but they just basically are like this is going to keep happening unless you switch over to digital voice. So before I do that with Verizon, I thought, well, we have been, you know, we know we have a good internet with you, so I wanted to see what services you offer for that, you know."" [Agent] ""Right. Sure, and then to have our phone service so you do not have to switch over to like a digital system you can have because our phone service goes through the cable lines, whereas their service goes through the old traditional telephone lines is that OK."" [Customer] ""Right, so that is what I figured so that is why I wanted, I figured we do not actually have to switch handsets and everything, so I wanted to find out what that looks like."" [Agent] ""No, you do not have to upgrade to like a hosted system. How many phone lines do you have, ma'am?"" [Customer] ""So we have X phone lines right now."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Do you want my account number?"" [Agent] ""I think I have it. I am waiting for it to populate it. Is it XXX South Washington ma'am?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, that is it."" [Agent] ""Yes, so you would be able to bring over your X lines and then let me just verify here as well. And um. Look for your access code just before I start talking to you pricing. I just want to verify something with you for account security. That is crazy to not have phone service for you. You guys are a salon, um."" [Customer] ""So, it is a day. It happened like a month ago, it happened for over X days, and then we are, we are a salon, so like we depend on our phone system for appointments and yeah, it is not like we are just, right, like we are not just like a random place that wants to have a phone line, like we need our phone lines for business."" [Agent] ""You need your phones, yeah, that is, that is what I was thinking because you needed to book appointments and. No, understood, um, so you can may I have your four digit access code, ma'am?"" [Customer] ""Yeah. God, I do not know what it is. Um, I am assuming it is XXXX?"" [Agent] ""That is a great um guess so."" [Customer] ""OK, yeah, that is my husband, so I am doing it for my husband. So I would imagine if he did it, that is what it is."" [Agent] ""No, it is all good."" [Customer] ""I might have even said it a long time ago. So."" [Agent] ""Let us see what we could do here. So if you were to bring over your X lines. And then with our phone lines you get a lot of the same features you get with the Verizon service so you have unlimited calls anywhere in the US, Canada, as well as Puerto Rico."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""So you get all of your calling amenities, call waiting, call forwarding, caller ID, enhanced voicemail, XXXX directory assistance would be included with that. And then you guys have also a XXX speed internet."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""We do not even sell that anymore. Um, you could definitely probably use the speed upgrade there. Bear with me."" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""I tell you what it would be for the X lines. And the X lines, ma'am would be $200."" [Customer] ""OK. I do not even give a, I do not care what it costs as long as it works."" [Agent] ""And No, it, it would work, um, and we would contact Verizon, ma'am, to let them know that you are switching over."" [Customer] ""Cause I think yeah, I mean, just like right now I am paying X."" [Agent] ""So while the switch between Optimum and Verizon is being made, there would be no downtime or lapse in service. I understand that the service is not working the way you want it to there is no interruption because you are so"" [Customer] ""OK Yeah, yeah, yeah, so let me ask you a question. I, I had kind of like did a little bit of this homework through like a chat, you know what I mean, on Optimum to kind of see like to get this information that you are giving me, um, so they had mentioned that like you make an appointment and then somebody comes to take a look at your equipment and everything and like make, you know, to see what you need is that how it works?"" [Agent] ""OK. Mhm. So I mean we do not have to do a pre-survey because you already have the optimum service so no pre-survey is really needed if that makes sense."" [Customer] ""OK. All right, that is fine. I just sort of was like, you know, I do not want to find out we do not really have what we need."" [Agent] ""Yeah, no."" [Customer] ""And then like I said, I just do not want there to be downtime in between um, you know, just for that reason, so"" [Agent] ""No, of course not, and then we schedule around business needs, so what happens is when we put the numbers in the system tells us the first available Verizon port date, but then you could tell me what works best for you because you are the customer if that makes sense."" [Customer] ""OK. OK, yeah, OK, perfect."" [Agent] ""So we work like you know, on your time I mean, I would recommend upgrading your internet speed since we are coming out."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""I am just see if I could put you like in a promotion or something, hold on, because you have like a XXX megabits download and XX up, we no longer even sell that, um."" [Customer] ""Yeah. OK."" [Agent] ""But you guys have probably had service with us for a long time I am assuming so. Let us just see. Sorry, I am just looking at the offers in your area."" [Customer] ""That is fine. I appreciate it."" [Agent] ""No, thank you for your patience."" [Customer] ""Yeah, no, please, if you knew the amount of hours I spent on the phone with Verizon in the last two months of my life, you would you can not even imagine"" [Agent] ""Well, that seems kind of, uh, you know, wild just because, you know."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""You are a business um."" [Customer] ""You know, I think the, the biggest issue with them too is like, I guess where we are, they do not actually offer files, which probably would be kind of equivalent to how you run our right, like you want to run our internet service there."" [Agent] ""Mhm. So, fiber, yes, I got you."" [Customer] ""And so we, yeah, yeah, yeah."" [Agent] ""So they are not really offering that. Let us see."" [Customer] ""No. Which seems crazy, but I guess they just do not they."" [Agent] ""Yeah, let us see. I mean, that is, you have a XXX, maybe we could put you like give a half a gig, so it is not so, you know, much more than what you are paying. I am just taking a look."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Has this internet been working out for you the speed?"" [Customer] ""I mean, the internet works, the internet is working out. My issue is I do not know if by doing the phone lines, if that, if that starts like interfering with the internet, in which case, I do not want that to be a problem, like, because"" [Agent] ""Well, no, our phone lines go through the cable, so it is not the traditional copper lines."" [Customer] ""OK, OK, so that should be fine because I mean the biggest thing with us is, you know, we are a big salon, so we have, you know, we have like XX employees who, you know, have their phones connected and again they are not sitting there, they are working, so they are not like sit all sitting on their phones at the same time, but we also have like a guest Wi Fi for our guests."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""So if they are getting their hair done, they might have their laptop, their computer, their phone. So I certainly do not want anything less than what we have, but if you think we could benefit from more, I, I have money to work with a little bit here because I already was already spending $260 a month with Verizon just for phone lines that do not work."" [Agent] ""Got you. Oh Lord. All right, let us see what we could do here. So then bear with me. Yeah, no, we need the phone lines to work. I, and I get it because you have the old copper liner saying that, so that is probably the, the what they are using to try to upgrade you, so to speak."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""That makes sense?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, and I am just nervous, like, I do not, you know, regardless, I mean, I just do not, they are sort of like, oh, then we are running on this digital, and it is kind of like a phone line, you have to get new phones. And I am like, uh, you know what, I do not, it just feels like too much change. If we can do it with you there is not a lot of change, I am happy"" [Agent] ""That is what I am trying to."" [Customer] ""I kind of do not know why we will ever had like X. Services to begin with, but this, um, you know, it used to be my husband's father's business, you know, for XX years before we have had it for like X years. So I think he just kept things the same until it was an issue. I am like why do we have two different providers"" [Agent] ""Maybe it was just the way it was at that time."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I think at the time when we, yeah, I think at the time, I do not think Optimum had they were worried the phone, who knows? I do not, it does not matter."" [Agent] ""Let us see here. Mhm. And so I can put you before even adding the phone lines that I can put you in a speed upgrade with the XXX so you get half a gig, you will be at XXX megabites download"" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""XX megabits upload, so uh you would be at double the bandwidth that you have because right now you are at XXX down XX upload, so you would actually go to half a gig, OK then you would also get a connection back up so say if there is optimum services out"" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK. OK. OK."" [Agent] ""Or like we have an outage, you have a failover that kicks in and that would provide business continuity."" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""So you still be able to process credit card payments in your salon."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""You also get some protection."" [Customer] ""Right, right."" [Agent] ""So say if you needed assistance setting up your networking or your TV, you need to repair. It is like having your own personal geek squad at your disposal, and it does cover device replacement as well."" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""The the cost difference on your bill would be $40 and that is not talking about the phone, that is just the speed and the backup and the connection."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so that, you know, it makes it kind of makes sense."" [Customer] ""Great."" [Agent] ""So almost like, you know, you are saving a little ahead of the game here and then with the because of the upgrade then you do not pay for the the porting of the numbers it is free because uh we are doing an upgrade here so there is no charge for that."" [Customer] ""Yeah. Right."" [Agent] ""There will be no charge for the text to come out and then do you know the X Verizon numbers or do you need for me to look them up?"" [Customer] ""OK Uh, I do I do, hold on"" [Agent] ""Who is more amazing than you then?"" [Customer] ""Wow. Hold on, I, I could be lying to you. I know, I definitely know. X of them or X of them."" [Agent] ""Um, I might be able to look them up for you if you give me the main number."" [Customer] ""So I can tell you what I definitely know so the main number"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""The main number is XXX. XXX-XXX-XX"" [Agent] ""Let me take a look."" [Customer] ""That is like the main number."" [Agent] ""Go take a look here. And I can not tell what you pay or anything. I could just see what they are charging you for so to speak."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah. It does not matter. I will tell you what it does."" [Agent] ""Hopefully. Hopefully I am able to see it cause sometimes it uh. Let us just see him."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I mean right now, cause I am looking at my Verizon bill. It does not say the other numbers. I know X of them, and I could probably call and find the other X because one of them is probably for the credit card processing or maybe not even because that is probably going online now. One of them is for we have like an ATM machine, so I think that goes through a phone line."" [Agent] ""Yeah, the ATM does usually go through a phone line."" [Customer] ""Yeah, and, and the 5th X probably was the credit card line which we probably do not use, honestly."" [Agent] ""Alright. So what I would recommend then you could still bring over all of the numbers and then if you decide that you want to drop a line drop it with us versus switching providers and canceling the phone line at the same time."" [Customer] ""That. Yeah, yeah, yeah."" [Agent] ""Does that make sense? Because then it is like two pending changes on your Verizon account and you want to make things as seamless as possible because I, you are already having issues, so I want to make it like."" [Customer] ""Yeah, totally. That is, yeah, that is totally fine. I get that, yeah. Yeah, yes, that sounds perfect. Yeah, that sounds great."" [Agent] ""As easy as possible and let me see I am running the number now so let us see what numbers it pulls from the CSR. And the primary number again is XXX-XXX-XXXX correct ma'am?"" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""Just wanted to verify that. OK, so let us see here. Oh, it does not allow me to pull any of the other numbers. That is interesting. So you probably could if you are at the salon, you could probably maybe call from that line to see."" [Customer] ""I was going to say, well, I will give you the other two lines that are definite phone lines if you want them."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""OK, so this line X is XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Line X is XXXXXX. XXX X"" [Agent] ""XXXX, so XXXX correct?"" [Customer] ""Yeah. Now let me, can I actually put you on a call with me because I am, I am not actually at the floor."" [Agent] ""Sure."" [Customer] ""My husband's there. Let me see if we can get them to so I just put you on hold for one second."" [Agent] ""Absolutely and if and we get disconnected for whatever reason this is the best contact number, ma'am?"" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""OK, I just want to make sure."" [Customer] ""So hold on one second, let me see if I can do that."" [Agent] ""No, no worries."" [Customer] ""If, um, so I know that the the two numbers obviously I know that there is XXXX I know there is XXXX. I know there is XXXX. Do you know the other two number lines anywhere? Do you know if Devani has them? Uh, let me see, I know one is definitely for the ATM, but I do not know what that phone number is. Let me see if we have it written down. You probably have it somewhere."" [Agent] ""And it is not listed on your Verizon bill, ma'am?"" [Customer] ""Uh, it is not. I, I, that is what I, I actually have it in front of me thinking they would all be on here."" [Agent] ""That is so weird."" [Customer] ""It is very weird."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""It only just has the main number on here. Let me see, hold on, because that is what I figured I am like, oh, I have the bill. I am sure it has all numbers, but it does not. Yeah, I know there is X like line numbers. Right, me too. I am looking through Nikki's phone book to see if they are. I mean, I worst case scenario I guess I am going to have to call Verizon and get them, but yeah. I just figured if you might have them there. I do not see it in here. Hold on, let me ask him real quick. Is my, my father-in-law is not there today, is he? Um, No, OK, I was like, I feel like maybe he would know, but that is what I asked you because the numbers that I am probably looking for are the one for the ATM and then the 5th line is I would imagine is probably the old line we used for the credit card machine, but now we do not use it for the, you know, now it goes to the internet, you know what I mean."" [Agent] ""Oh, so then you do not need it. You probably just need X lines then."" [Customer] ""Right, right, right, so like you said, I do not know if I should drop that or what I need to do."" [Agent] ""OK, got you."" [Customer] ""Sorry, I have somebody else on here Izzy obviously. Um, let me see if he knows the ATM number. Just I am just going to put you on hold for one sec. Alright, thanks honey."" [Agent] ""Sorry, I did not mean to, you know, jump in."" [Customer] ""No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that is totally fine. I just did not, she was probably like, what, what was that? That was fine."" [Agent] ""Who is that lady?"" [Customer] ""Who is at your house with you? What is going on? Yeah, I do not think we are going to need that 5th line. I think like I said, I am pretty sure that that 5th line is just with the old line for the credit card."" [Agent] ""Yeah, and especially if you are processing through."" [Customer] ""He said we do not have it written down anywhere. OK, alright, that is fine."" [Agent] ""Did you want to just do a new number for that then, ma'am?"" [Customer] ""I will get it from Verizon. I just. No, I do not think so because like I said I can get it from them because I do not want that to become like a, I mean I guess it just call me if you need me."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Alright, thanks honey you can hang up thank you bye."" [Agent] ""Sure, do you want me to call you back to get it or you tell me?"" [Customer] ""Um, Well, What do you think? I do think it is going to be an issue if we I mean because those three numbers are the only numbers that we use as like phone lines that anybody, and the truth be told, the only number we put out there to customers is XXXX and the other ones just are like rollover lines, yeah."" [Agent] ""Yeah, the others are like roll over, yeah, that is why I was saying if you wanted to just get a new number for the ATM you could as well."" [Customer] ""So let us do that. Yeah, let us do that and just mix the other two cause I really do not care."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Cause nobody's going to use it as a phone line."" [Agent] ""So did you want to just do uh so did you want to do X lines or X lines if you are going to do away with the other line you do not need it."" [Customer] ""It is just, as long as it is not going to be an issue. Let us just do, yeah, let us just do X because I mean the credit card machine runs through the internet now."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""I think back in the day, like I said the business is over X years old, so probably that this line had to be just for the credit card machine."" [Agent] ""You have that line and you can always add a line too if you decide that you want to add a line if that makes sense what I am saying?"" [Customer] ""Right, that we need it. OK, that is fine."" [Agent] ""Yes ma'am. And then once these numbers are ported over then you can just discontinue the Verizon service completely to make sure that they are no longer charging you."" [Customer] ""OK, perfect."" [Agent] ""Yeah, for some reason sometimes I am able to see what is on your bill, but for some reason it is not allowing me to pull it and it is so strange that they do not have them listed on the bill somewhere. A little"" [Customer] ""It is weird, right? I am like, because I am looking even at my paper bill right now going like, why would not, it does not even actually say, it just says your solutions for business bundle includes basic internet for X years, which I think that is just like we do not even use that internet I it is like DSL."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""I think it is just been on here for a million years because we have literally been with Verizon."" [Agent] ""Oh, so you are double paying for internet as well. That is interesting."" [Customer] ""Yes, yeah, like we, cause we have literally been with Verizon for over XX years. I am not even kidding you. And then it says X additional lines unlimited to your bundle price there is no lines, like there is nothing else It does not tell me what there is."" [Agent] ""Oh, that is interesting."" [Customer] ""Weird, right?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, usually it, it is somewhere usually in the body of the bill, but."" [Customer] ""Yeah. I would think so too, but it is not."" [Agent] ""And I am just going to repeat the number that you gave me back to you um, so I see XXXXXXXXXX then I see XXXXXX-XXXX And then I see XXXXXXXXXX, is that correct?"" [Customer] ""Mhm. Yes, yep."" [Agent] ""OK, I just want to make sure. With the XXXX being your billing telephone number."" [Customer] ""Right, being the main line and then the other ones being roll over, yeah."" [Agent] ""Uh Understood."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And then I am just running the numbers through our CSR to see the first available date that Verizon would release the lines to us."" [Customer] ""OK perfect."" [Agent] ""Um, So the first available date they would release the phone line to us ma'am would be the 21st, which is a Monday. I do not know if Mondays are a good day for you or."" [Customer] ""That is actually perfect because Monday is the day that we are actually like closed for business we only take like"" [Agent] ""Oh perfect."" [Customer] ""So that I was actually going to say, if we could do a Monday, that would be amazing."" [Agent] ""So I could do Monday the 21st I can do X to XXXX to X, or X to X, ma'am"" [Customer] ""Um, let us do XX to X, please."" [Agent] ""And then I can have the technician phone prior to coming out. Should they call the salon or a mobile? What is the best contact?"" [Customer] ""Um, Call, I would have them call the salon because they are coming out to there and somebody's there at like XX in the morning, so I think that is fine."" [Agent] ""OK, so the XXX-XXX-XXXX numbers that is no phone."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""OK, and then I just see the email because I want to make sure you have a correct email. So we have info at Capelli Hair Salon LLC.com."" [Customer] ""No, so this, so I, I was going to say, can you help me with this? Because same thing, this is like so old."" [Agent] ""Sure, what is that?"" [Customer] ""So can I give you an updated email?"" [Agent] ""Absolutely."" [Customer] ""So it is Antonelli, so it is going to be A N T O N E L L I. GIO like G O."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""XXX At gmail.com."" [Agent] ""At gmail.com, so this is going to be so this is this is where you should get a confirmation from Optimum then."" [Customer] ""Brilliant."" [Agent] ""So what I did is I actually added that as the primary email associated cause that that other email was not even in."" [Customer] ""Great."" [Agent] ""Um, It is weird. It is like it was not even in the primary email field."" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""Let us see."" [Customer] ""And then, I do not know if you can help me with this we can do this different time I am not really sure I feel like I am completely, I think I was online the other day on the optimum thing now, I do not know what I did"" [Agent] ""Sure, tell me."" [Customer] ""I I might have changed the password, now I forget it. And now when I am trying to change it, like, say, hey, I forgot my password."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Uh, I am, I am not getting it. I do not know why. I do not know, it keeps telling me everything I am putting in is wrong so I do not"" [Agent] ""So that I would have to probably get business class advanced on the line too because I am not able to see your portal um but bear with me."" [Customer] ""OK, OK. Right, that is what I, I did not know if that was your department or not."" [Agent] ""No, no, but I can get you to who can assist you with that because so this way you can have access so you should be getting a what we call an electronic letter of authorization to that Antonelli email that you gave me."" [Customer] ""That is fine, that is OK. OK."" [Agent] ""That is just going to confirm the X numbers that you uh gave me."" [Customer] ""Alright bye Yeah."" [Agent] ""Basically it is just saying you are, you know authorizing Optimum to become your local, your long distance, your regional, all that good stuff You just want to like check the little box and you know click the terms of use if that makes sense, but nothing physically takes place until we send. Somebody out on the 21st. So up until then you will have Verizon of New Jersey as your provider if that makes sense, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK, perfect."" [Agent] ""And then I just want to actually, um, even the upgrade of the speed does not really cost you anything."" [Customer] ""Yeah, perfect."" [Agent] ""I just want to go over everything with with you because it is actually less now since we took away a phone line. So you are what we are adding to your bill is $200 OK, and what that consists of is the X lines, X of which were porting, and one would be a new number which would be for uh the ATM machine, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And then also we would be upgrading your speed from XXX."" [Customer] ""OK, OK."" [Agent] ""Megabits download to a half a gig so you are at XXX megabits download and XX megabits upload, which is more of a business class speed you guys had a XXX speed which you know we have not sold in some time you probably, you know, like you said you never had like a need or looked at the uh speed here"" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""And you would also be getting a connection backup, which is very important."" [Customer] ""OK perfect."" [Agent] ""So say in the event that there is an optimum outage, the failover would kick in. You are still able to process credit card payments. So it is a backup system. It is not meant to use as a primary, but it is a backup."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah."" [Agent] ""You guys have two internets now, but I am not sure you are using it in that manner as like, you know, I think it is just because you had that Verizon service."" [Customer] ""OK, great. Yeah, I do not think so."" [Agent] ""I do not think you are using what."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""You have like that, but just so you know, sometimes customers will have two internets as, you know, because you are a salon. If one goes down and the other one kicks in as a backup, but we offer a backup and it is, it is less."" [Customer] ""Right. Right."" [Agent] ""It is built into that promotion that I gave you, so you get a a backup then you do have the premium protection You get the advanced troubleshooting, which is like having a geek squad at your disposal I did not charge you a fee to have the Optimum technician come out OK, so your total monthly reoccurring bill would be XXX, and this will be in a confirmation email."" [Customer] ""Thank you I really appreciate that so much."" [Agent] ""You will probably get the porting email first. The confirmation email sometimes could take up to XX hours to come through because of our server, but it is going to go to that Antonelli email that you provided me."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""With, OK, and then I am also going to give you, uh, yep, perfect, perfect I am also going to give you the best contact number in case you do need to call in, make any changes, support"" [Customer] ""Yeah, I, so I just got this this beginning sign. Yeah."" [Agent] ""I would like to provide this number it is XXX."" [Customer] ""Yes, oK."" [Agent] ""X,XXX,XXX that is going to be the best number to get you into the commercial sales department, ma'am."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh. Excellent. I really appreciate it."" [Agent] ""OK, and in case you want to know who you spoke with, my name is Dana."" [Customer] ""You have been so helpful."" [Agent] ""I am the only Dana here, OK?"" [Customer] ""Thank you, Gina.

I hope you guys, you know, continue because you guys have been in business for a long time, you know."" [Customer] ""Thank you so much. We really appreciate it."" [Agent] ""No worries what I am going to do now is I am going to get you over to tech support to obtain your login information or reset, I should say So I am going to get business class Advance on the line to assist. Just so you are aware we do offer mobile service for business"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""I do not know um if you know that we offer mobile if you guys were to bundle your mobile, you could actually save $20 a month They are switching over to the optimal mobile, so we have unlimited plans as low as $45 a month, talk and text, and then the network that we are utilizing is T-Mobile so we are part of the largest XG network So there is added savings when you bundle your mobile with your business account.""

[Agent] ""Alright, allow me a moment. I am going to get tech support on the line to assist."" [Customer] ""Alright Thank you.""

Is that, is that a month to month is that a contract It there is no contract month to month the price is locked for X years, which is good That means that uh even with tariffs or anything like that, uh, you know. Yeah, but what about if we can not, I am just saying just in case, what about if we cancel before the X years? I do not want to have to pay. Yeah, there is no cancellation fees there is no contract I do not want to. OK, there is no cancellation fee, OK. Yeah, and do you have the payment information on uh available? No, usually what um what we do, well, when I set up these accounts basically they set them up through the tax ID and then um we are billed and then we set up the auto pay as soon as you give me the account number we go into the online page and then we set up the account as soon as it is created. OK. Oh OK, so on the bill right now you are going to see $105 once you know the auto pay is set, uh, you get a $5 a $5 discount OK. Got you OK. Um, we will, uh, there is an install fee. It is a one time, it is $100. It gets applied to the bill, not on site. OK, and that that can not be waived?

[Agent] ""Do you know the name of the business that was that uh that was there prior to you guys?"" [Customer] ""No I do not. There is no signs left saying who was there."" [Agent] ""Mhm. OK, probably have to just update that um because I do not see like any suites that are like XXXX, they are like all like XXX, XXX, but I can just add it. A suite one."" [Customer] ""Alright, and I can, I can, um. I can email the property management company to and ask them who was there before if that helps."" [Agent] ""Mm, no, that is fine."" [Customer] ""I can just go ahead and put it in as building X. I will, I will update it here on the system, um. OK. OK, let me see this is a gig market, so up to one gig. I am going to ask you a few questions about the business that way we can build the right package for your business needs. OK. And do you guys need phone services? Yes How many phone lines? We currently have hold on. Where does it say that on here? We currently have XXXXXXX phone lines and one is a fax number. And One is fax. OK, so X, is it X total with the fax line or X with the fax line? XX total with the fax line. And are we reporting these numbers from your current provider? Now let us see XXX. XX X XX no X total with the fax line sorry I miscounted it was on there um, is that possible? Yeah it is uh the thing is they have to stay active with your current provider until we come out there to install the services. When do you need the services active? We have access to the facility in May we have to be fully moved by July so we are going to be in both places until that time Oh, OK, so then in that case because you are going to, so it is overlapping. Because the phone numbers of their landlines, they can they are assigned to an address so they can only work at one address at a time. One place or the other so we will have to figure out how we when we port them. Yeah. Um, what I would recommend to do is get you dummy numbers for the new address, and then when you are ready to pull the lines you can just call us we can place that order Alright, and I will have to ask my boss. I, I am assuming that is what he wants to do because the way that they have it set up now, and I do not how it is going to have been I do not fully understand there is multiple lines. And they are not to be assigned I think it is just how the the phone system works. Mhm. And we have looked um I need to do some checking on uh there is a different phone service that our phone provider uh suggested that we look at too. Oh, OK then you guys have a BHV service which is a business hosted voice. How many phone numbers is the total? Um, It is XX total phone numbers that I see on the bill that we are paying for today. But they are not just regular landlines, right? They are like the ones that are the business voice system. No they are, they are hardwired phones, but I do not, I do not know if they have, I know one is definitely a fax number and I do not know if the other X are to be able to have enough lines because we have XXXXXX or X people in the office. Mhm. And I do not know if it is so that everybody can pick up a line. I am not 100% sure about why it was set up this way. It is probably so they can roll over in case of the uh somebody's calling and somebody is not picking up they can just go to the next line that is available. Yeah, do we we will still need to do that? You can still do that. So about the Internet service, how many devices are you running off the Internet? OK. Um So it by device let me just make sure I am on the same page, computers, phones, um, printers you are looking for all of that? Mhm. Well, not like the exact amount, but like somewhere between maybe like XX. I will have There is probably XX to XX. Because do the do the phones there is let us see we have XXXXXX. XX PCs we have a copier that uh is also set up as our fax machine then we have um a printer for construction drawings, the blueprint Awesome, OK, that, that tells me, um, that tells me enough here. So what I would recommend for you guys it is the X gig, so you are going to need the high speed internet regardless because if you have more than X devices connected to the Internet, then we recommend a high Internet speed that way you do not have any technical issues with your services such as slow speed or latency or intermittent service um. And and then our the IT guy that helps us, he said we need one static IP address. OK, OK, I can definitely get that done for you, absolutely, um, let us go ahead and set up your account that way I can give you. The price on your monthly cost. Because I will have to bundle everything together um, what is the name of the company OK. RFJ Associates. That is the legal name of the company we have a a doing business as name too um I assume you want the legal name. Um, we can do whichever name you want to do, ma'am. Does it either one is fine. OK, and then do you have the tax ID? Uh, federal or Connecticut? Uh, the federal, please. OK XXXXXXXXX And then who is going to be the primary user for this account? Mm, rich Jago.

Does it for auto pay you have to hook up to a bank account? Mhm yeah or or a card. Or card, OK, and we will just do the pay by check. OK. And what was the preferred date for install? Um I was over there the other day they are still doing sheetrock. So Let me look at the calendar for May. As long as you have electricity we can hook it up. OK, um. Why do not we say Monday? Uh, no, I will not. I am going to be away on the cruise that day. Um Let us let us say Monday, May 19th. OK.

Uh, no, not Bermuda, sorry, it was a big place, um yeah, X days out of New York, so easy Oh my goodness. Very easy. Yeah. I live in Texas, so. I have never done a cruise. It is something that it is definitely my bucket list for me to get on a cruise, I have to drive all the way to Galveston, which is like X hour drive just to get there Uh, yeah, to drive like for me to get to New York it is about an hour a half or X hour and XX Yeah, that is not bad. Uh, or, or, or the other option is you fly to San Juan or Miami or somewhere and just a lot of logistics. Mm. Mhm. Yeah. But it is a great value for the money. Cause Uh, which cruise are you going with? We are going with Royal Caribbean. Oh. We have done celebrity as well and uh. Mhm It is nice because you do not have to worry about anything.

Uh $148 with taxes, but if you set up auto pay, you do save $5 so we bring it back down to, yeah, and you can set that up any time. Installation is only a one time fee of $100. You do not pay the tax. We actually bill back to you and John I also give like a $10 discount I, I told you that before, and this also comes with the connection backup system, which is great because if in case there is an outage, OK, that system will pick up and your and your credit card machine, that booking device that you have for like booking and credit card machine will always stay on and then when our if our system comes back on."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Then it will it will go over to our system, so I love that, OK, so you should have any issues with that, and that is valid at $30."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So I am glad I am able to put that in for you on that promotion. You have my email, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""If you need, John, this is another thing that they can offer you.

Unlimited talk and text because you are taking one gig service with us so if that is something that you want to do, maybe you have an old phone and you want to try it out, let me know because I can set it up for you."" [Customer] ""OK. So, so you are saying it, it, it would be, it would be an addi it would be an additional how much for, for the phone line."" [Agent] ""It is super easy. So it is, so the business cell phone is a $45 plan after X months you get a $40 credit on your account, so it really comes out to be like $5. That is an unlimited talk and text."" [Customer] ""Like a like a like a one time thing."" [Agent] ""No, no, each month, you, yeah, like a month, yeah, each."" [Customer] ""For a monthly fee? Oh, each, so each month will be.

[Customer] ""Um, I think it is X camera."" [Agent] ""X cameras. OK, now, uh, OK, are you doing like a static IP address or you just keeping it just strictly cameras so you could check?"" [Customer] ""Uh, what does that mean? I do not understand."" [Agent] ""Um, the static IP is, is a, is an individual like a a safe connection so you could check it out so it is a designated connection. Um, so that is why that is what some people use when they are running cameras, but if you are looking, you know, for, for the business side, you know, if you are looking to run cameras, a lot of the people that do this in the city, they get the XXX speed internet to make sure they have enough, um, and that is the best way to go and with business, if you bundle a mobile line I could give you a discount on that price as well."" [Customer] ""I do not want the I do not want the movie. I just, I am not going to come over."" [Agent] ""Understood. Well, I just, I just want to give you the option of all the savings.""

[Agent] ""Yes Absolutely, yeah, it is, it is $100 to back out of our driveway."" [Customer] ""Well Yeah"" [Agent] ""We live in we live in New York It is expensive you know, so So that is why uh we can do that. I can set you up the the $300 internet is $60 when you do the auto pay. And it is a tax write off for the business."" [Customer] ""That is not going to help me. That, that, uh, and so can we get it for um the quote that you are getting before? Can I get it for cheaper than $60?"" [Agent] ""Oh"" [Customer] ""So what, what my What my husband really wants. He wants to stay home and watch the cameras there."" [Agent] ""OK, well there is nothing there currently. And this is this would be new pricing as well so this pricing would be good for a year as well so you are getting new customer pricing on this."" [Customer] ""But I, I, um, my husband just came out about an hour ago and they were quoting him $50 and I told him let me go and see what."" [Agent] ""And Maybe"" [Customer] ""And I told him let me go and see."" [Agent] ""And it is possible maybe they were giving some sort of discount on the residential side, but in business for $300.65 dollars is basically the minimum for the XXX speed. It goes down to $60 when you do the auto pay."" [Customer] ""So you give me"" [Agent] ""But if you want like."" [Customer] ""So give me the, give me the."" [Agent] ""Uh,"" [Customer] ""Give me the resident of X."" [Agent] ""Well I do not work in the residential department. I do the business, but that is why I would say."" [Customer] ""Oh, what the thing you want to say."" [Agent] ""Now, now, with this, like I said, if you bought, if you added uh a tablet line or just emergency phone, you do not have to pay for a phone even if you have one laying around. I could give you a $15 discount on that price then you will be down to $45"" [Customer] ""OK, so let me go to the residential because sometimes my husband is over there anyway. Most of the time it is in there. So let me go for the residential."" [Agent] ""It is both Well, but now in just in this, just so you know uh, with Optimum business takes precedence so like if there is ever any outages or anything, we go to businesses first So that is why we usually do it that way, you know, so I mean I hate to see, I, I do not know what they got on the residential side, you know uh I know that this is the floor for us is the XX and $60 for"" [Customer] ""OK, Yeah"" [Agent] ""Uh let me, if you want, uh, let me just take a look, see if there is, you know, anything that changed with that is, that is as far as I, that is as far as I got, I believe."" [Customer] ""So what I am just looking at the residential side."" [Agent] ""So"" [Customer] ""Let me, let me go to the residential side because we are retired we do not have that kind of money $10 that is it. $10 we can say."" [Agent] ""I know it all adds up I try I want to just make sure I am giving you the best I possibly can over here just uh"" [Customer] ""So"" [Agent] ""And now are you, so is there going to be anything connected to there other than cameras like when you said your husband's there, is he going to be um doing anything other than that?"" [Customer] ""No, mm, all the, all the camera he wants to set up."" [Agent] ""OK, let me, let me look at something here because I, I am seeing we have. What is this for? I am just looking to see something because. Well sir Because this is for fiber, I believe, I believe I can match the XX for business. Let me take a look at something, right? Because if I could do that, Uh, let me see, I do not see any. Yeah, I, I could do the XX for business. I could do that."" [Customer] ""The best person so uh let me."" [Agent] ""So we"" [Customer] ""Let me, I will talk to you because I do not, I do not want to get something that he, he does not, you know, it, it, it does not, uh."" [Agent] ""No, no, it Oh, I am telling you I could do it. I just found out. I just looked up and I could do it right now for you. We have a special promo running right now that is what we could do."" [Customer] ""And and and and how long that $50 will last."" [Agent] ""That this is for XX months."" [Customer] ""And after XX months, what is going to happen?"" [Agent] ""Well, it we would increase if you have a good payment history, Optimum's terrific for customer service So if you call in and you have a good payment history, they will work on extending it. And by that time, who knows, you might be you want to upgrade. Who knows whatever changes you want to make, but then you could do that then."" [Customer] ""XX."" [Agent] ""So we, I guess"" [Customer] ""Can I just go with the Can I just go to the resident site and see what we get what what we can get."" [Agent] ""Well, I am, I am giving you exactly what they, I am giving you exactly what they were offering you."" [Customer] ""I know you do not deal with OK."" [Agent] ""And then now you have me.""

I do not know if he is the one who takes care of that, so I do not understand all those things."" [Agent] ""Understood. Do you want to call him?"" [Customer] ""Internet business, I do not know. Yeah."" [Agent] ""Reason being because I do this for a lot, especially a lot in the city, a lot of the people that whether it is a rental or whatever they are setting up a lot you know simply just for cameras."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""So this is what they do. They all do the XXX internet with just the data only because you do not need a phone or anything.

[Agent] ""Mhm yeah so how it works this is an it is it is a cell phone line. Typical cost for the line is $45 a month."" [Customer] ""Mm."" [Agent] ""But because you are getting this speed, there is a discount that we can apply. It takes X to X billing cycles for the discount to apply on the cell phone line. And it works out in your favor because at the end of the day the cost for the phone line is $45 And then you get a $40 discount, so it works out just being $5 for that mobile line. Mhm and then you can keep yourself, you can also keep your cell phone number."" [Customer] ""OK"" [Agent] ""And if you want to if you needed to, um, not only we give you the line then we can explore the options of maybe giving you a cell phone, you know, at that point you do have to, you know, finance the phone we have the options to give you cell phones as well"" [Customer] ""Uh, what if I have my own cell phone?

[Agent] ""Yeah, we would just have to um I am pretty sure we can do it we would have to verify the IMEI with our system just to make sure that it is compatible."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Um"" [Customer] ""So does it have a data? What data does it have?"" [Agent] ""Uh, it has unlimited data, so the, the, yeah, it is unlimited, unlimited calling, texting, and unlimited internet we actually use T-Mobile towers as well, so you have great network, great coverage"" [Customer] ""So you are telling me. We can turn that phone on. Have a different number For $5 a month?"" [Agent] ""Yes, yes, you get a you, you, the cost for the phone line, uh, it is $45 a month normally. Let us say you did not have this speed that I am that I just gave you the, the, the, the X gig. Let us say you did not have the speed and you are asking me for a phone line, I would tell you it is $45."" [Customer] ""Uh"" [Agent] ""But now I am letting you know that because you now have the speed, you could take advantage of an unlimited mobile line."" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""For only $5. Yes, you do pay X or X billing cycles at the rate of $45 until the credits apply. And yes you do pay a one time activation fee on a credit card for $20 but then after that, as long as you keep your internet, uh, uh, with us, you get the benefit of the mobile line at only $5."" [Customer] ""So you can not waive, so is it an activation fee for the internet?"" [Agent] ""It is an activation fee for the cell phone. Not for the internet. There is no fee right now for the for for what we did for the appointment. You are all set. There is no uh uh installation fee or activation fee.

Rangers, um, and Knicks because they were They were considered the Long Island teams at the time in the XX, I grew up in the XXs, so."" [Agent] ""Almost, almost the same time."" [Customer] ""Um, Yeah we went, we went, we went for decades without watching winning football, so I really did not Live or die by the football, you know what I mean?"" [Agent] ""Mhm, mhm."" [Customer] ""And I actually Actually, my ex was a big Ranger fan. I was a season ticket holder for XX years, but"" [Agent] ""Oh wow."" [Customer] ""My brother and I were at the Stanley when they raised the cup, and my mother and sister were Islander fans because they became hockey fans when the Miracle on Ice occurred. And by that point, the Islanders were in existence for X years. So when my brother and I grew up there were no Islanders, we were Rangers fans And then when the team moved in next door, my mother and sister got on the bandwagon just as they won X cups. Not, not"" [Agent] ""It is easy to follow them when they are always winning, right?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, and she lives in Kansas City now, so for football she is been."" [Agent] ""Oh wow."" [Customer] ""Annoying for the last X years."" [Agent] ""Yeah, it is definitely been uh quite the casey um of uptick, you know, and people, yes, and people that are like joining it."" [Customer] ""So Who Mhm."" [Agent] ""I mean this, this, this, this one was a, was a tough one. They were really coming out there expecting to make it a triple, uh, you know, a triple, and uh they kind of felt very short, but it is fine. OK, so to go ahead and, and put your TV preferences mildly. Um, our, our packages are very simple. There is only X packages, so it is hard to get, it is, it is hard to get it wrong. With what you need, you, with what the, what you actually named, that hits you right specifically on the value package. The value package gives you about XXX stations. There is only one above it would be the preferred package. I will go ahead and quote it to you including the value package so that you know we are all on the same page here. And if you ever want to go ahead and make a change, it is a simple phone call because you would already have the boxes. What we got to do is hit the additional pack of the channels and they would flow right through. So we will start with the value and as far as the services are concerned, let us take a look here. Let me put here the 2nd box so that we are quoting you complete amounts. Um, do you own your home? Do you lease it? What is the?"" [Customer] ""Only"" [Agent] ""OK, not a problem. And how long is this lease going to be at this location for? So I know because I have a, I have a X year, I have a X year promo I have, OK, because I have a X year promotion and a X year promotion"" [Customer] ""Well, the moment, the moment one year. One year my last my last one went, my last one went. X years, so I do not tend to move a lot."" [Agent] ""OK, so did you want me to, OK, that is good."" [Customer] ""Because I like it."" [Agent] ""So did you want me to give you a X year promo as opposed to a X year promotion or how are you feeling? You feeling comfy?"" [Customer] ""No, no, I am afraid I, I do not want to do that because the landlord might want to sell too. It might not be my choice."" [Agent] ""Oh well there is no contract. Well, here is the thing, there is no contract. You can cancel service at any time. It just basically locks in the pricing structures so that you do not have fluctuations in pricing for that long. So I could do a X year promotion. I could do a X year promotion you can cancel service at any time"" [Customer] ""Mhm. And what are the two? what is the difference?"" [Agent] ""Well, the difference in pricing is like XX bucks, but if you want, what I will do is that I will start out with a X year promotion, and if you ever want to, if, if there throughout our conversation you want me to change it to the X year promo, then I can do that for you. So sit tight for me just a couple of moments."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""And I will do what we do for our normal business customers. I am going to also include that one static IP that you required, and remember it includes a down tone."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So if you need to put in a fax machine, you need to make a phone call by all means it is all there no contracts or cancellation charges"" [Customer] ""Yeah, we use BOIP we would now have a, we would now, I would now have to be able to have stacks again What a shock."" [Agent] ""Go figure."" [Customer] ""No, it is like we have been without it for a while. You have to understand something."" [Agent] ""I am listening."" [Customer] ""The facts ruined ruined the practice of law, because you could always dump something after the last mail pickup, knowing it would not be picked up till X day or X days later or X days later."" [Agent] ""Really?"" [Customer] ""And you had true deniability because it was the truth. Once they invented the fax all your."" [Agent] ""Oh, I see what you mean."" [Customer] ""All that wiggle time went bye bye."" [Agent] ""So it is so, it, it, it ruined it in a more um The people were held more accountable kind of situation"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Got you, got you, got you. OK, so as far as the services are concerned and I am adding all the multi-product discounts that I can go ahead and offer on and put on the account, including the value package including the internet service with the gig speed of service, of course the. Mode on the route of the premier technical support, the connection failover service, no contract and no cancellation charges as far as the services. The pricing structure would be 362.95. The estimated taxes is X,XXX I will let you know in just a few moments how quickly we can get somebody out there for you as far as the services are concerned So just sit tight for me a few moments."" [Customer] ""And that is what is that is the X year?"" [Agent] ""That is the X year promotion. If you wanted to do the X year promotion, it would be an additional, let me just make sure that it is only a $20 difference between the two, meaning it would go up by $20 but you know in the long term it is a better overall. Um, promotion."" [Customer] ""How much um what, how much of this is the TV?"" [Agent] ""I am listening. How much of that is the TV service? I will tell you immediately."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""It would be XX x X plus XXX plus. XXX $182.98 is the TV service."" [Customer] ""What is the Yeah, I need to. Oh I just wanted to see what the Bundles were with."" [Agent] ""If you wanted to do it without, then let me tell you what the pricing would be without."" [Customer] ""Um,"" [Agent] ""So right now we are at XXX XX with $15.41 in taxes and if I just click off the codes that contain. The TV. That brings the price down to XXX."" [Customer] ""So basically half of its strategic."" [Agent] ""That is including the static IP pretty much. Yeah, well, a little bit more, yeah, a little bit more than that."" [Customer] ""OK, um. Yeah, so I do not know if I."" [Agent] ""Yeah. That install which is $130 or 129.95 for the two boxes goes down to $100 if it is just the Internet service. Cause"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""What Where can I find the differences in the TV packages and what if we add phones?"" [Agent] ""This already includes one phone number onto it, um, that is part of the double play because it is giving you a deeper discount on the internet."" [Customer] ""No, I mean, I meant, is it, do they have cell phones or not?"" [Agent] ""I can add cell phone services to it, um. I mean you can add an unlimited line for $47 including taxes and once that is established and active, it takes $40 additional off your gig speed of service."" [Customer] ""But"" [Agent] ""So I basically can sell you a cell phone for business purposes for $7 more. That is put that in conversation. Let us put an asterisk on that and let us put it to the side because I want to make sure I do not overwhelm you with the TV portion decision so because that one's really simple."" [Customer] ""Because Yeah, but the the."" [Agent] ""You can do that now, you can do the TV later, you know, it is."" [Customer] ""Um, I am just, I am just trying to find where I could find the the differences in the TVs."" [Agent] ""I can go ahead and advise you as I mentioned, there is only X packages, so it is really simple."" [Customer] ""And in the past Yeah, but I was on the web trying to find them and I am not doing that."" [Agent] ""I do not, I do not want you to feel. I, I get it, but you have the answers, but you have the answer in me, so I am, I am going to make it really simple. So the preferred package is XXX."" [Customer] ""It is not the price."" [Agent] ""The Oh yeah, no, no, well, I am going to, that is why I am, that is why I am going to go ahead and explain to you and the value package is XXX."" [Customer] ""I wanted to see what was in it that that is what."" [Agent] ""The package below that is the choice, and the choice package is there actually there is no choice package in this area, so it is actually only X packages Broadcast Basic, which is just the locals XX X, XXXX uses XX on Telemundo teleuttura, that kind of thing. Then you have the value then you have the pro"" [Customer] ""You got that that well."" [Agent] ""Thank you I appreciate it."" [Customer] ""You got that accent down well."" [Agent] ""I was born in Colombia, so it comes through naturally."" [Customer] ""And then. Uh."" [Agent] ""So let me go."" [Customer] ""Well, my daughter, my daughter's fiance is from Colombia. They just call it the motherland."" [Agent] ""Yes"" [Customer] ""Um, when they go back."" [Agent] ""Oh, has she been?"" [Customer] ""Yeah. Uh. No, no, no. They are getting married next year. She has not been."" [Agent] ""OK. All right. Well, um, beautiful, beautiful country, beautiful country, beautiful food, beautiful flowers, beautiful coffee."" [Customer] ""Even eventually. Even."" [Agent] ""It is, uh, whenever she gets a chance to go there, she will, she will love it. Do you mind if I ask where he is from?"" [Customer] ""Currently, well, I mean, his father's from Colombia, his mother's from Mexico. They currently live together in Maplewood."" [Agent] ""Oh OK, no, no, no, I thought you knew what what city in Colombia he was from because that is the next question that everybody asks."" [Customer] ""But No, I do not know what city. No, I do not go. I, that much I do not have. OK."" [Agent] ""OK All right, no problem."" [Customer] ""Normally I have, normally I would find a little more information the moment I do not, so"" [Agent] ""No, no stress. That is, that is the first thing that unfortunately Colombians do. It is like oh, you know this person And so we identify, we are like, oh, that is from the coffee region. Oh, that is from the coast. Oh, that is from the valley, you know kind of thing"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""So that is what we do."" [Customer] ""Yeah, except What is funny about that is um. Like for example, I, there is a. In Jersey City in the Heights, about X mile from here, X mile and a half. There is a bakery called Bread and Salt Bakery the guys are from somewhere in Italy But when I And they are only open Friday to Sunday I went on Friday because I was going to get a shot In my hip from my doctor. He is from Bari, Italy, and those guys are from the region next to it. And I brought him a dessert that took him back to his childhood, a couple of those he, he just lit up He, he said, now let us taste it."" [Agent] ""Mm."" [Customer] ""He waited, he, he called me after he tasted, he goes, no. Now I want to know the guy's last name because we better see who is related to who, because"" [Agent] ""Oh wow."" [Customer] ""People would make that dessert, but very few people make it right, and that one was spot on, you know, and I just thought it last."" [Agent] ""Oh, that is delicious. That is great. I am glad, I am glad he did not, it did not disappoint."" [Customer] ""Yeah, and No, but I mean, uh, it was just one of those things where if you hit someone who came from somewhere with something from their childhood like that."" [Agent] ""You hit the spot. Mhm."" [Customer] ""It they light up like, you know."" [Agent] ""Yes, I agree there is a, there is a couple of desserts and a couple of tradition and bakery, um, breads and things of the sort that whenever I go back, it is like we have to hit these spots because if we do not, then it is like I feel like I did not go home."" [Customer] ""But something on the machine so."" [Agent] ""So let me go back to, so let me go back to your channels and I appreciate you having these um very nice conversations with me so."" [Customer] ""Right. OK, yeah. Premium was XXX and what was XXX which seems silly at that point."" [Agent] ""So the XXX just to confirm, so it is only a $15 price difference and let me go ahead and name you some of the channels that you would get in the preferred package that you would not get in the value package and then you tell me if you feel like it is worth the extra $15."" [Customer] ""X Mhm."" [Agent] ""Independent film channel, Hallmark Channel, Hallmark Movies and Mystery, Euronews, BBCN. Then we have Discovery Family. Um, we have Nick McToons TV. You have Team Nick you have Disney then we have Discovery Life"" [Customer] ""Yeah"" [Agent] ""We have MTV Life we have Pop HD, we have the Cowboy Channel, NetG Wild, which I love actually Um, you have FYI you have Viceland, Smithsonian Channel Uh, M A G N H. you have, let us see what is the other one, the cooking channel you already have in the original one in the Valley, you already have the Food Network The Cooking Channel is another one. the Science Channel is in Preferred American Heroes channel, um FETV, uh, the one, logo and own, those are in preferred, um, GFMA."" [Customer] ""Yeah, there is not much, there is. There really is not much in there other than that field that, and I do not have that now that I would even watch."" [Agent] ""Oh Well, you have National Geographics on the regular one Nat Wild is uh like a, a extra chan uh extra, you know"" [Customer] ""Yeah. No I know."" [Agent] ""Um, shows and stuff, so so far it seems like the, the value package would go ahead and fit nicely within what you like to have. Um, based on the channels that we have named that you named earlier, um, and remember you could always add the additional stations at any given time."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I already have beyond and separate. I pay. I use a rou I pay for Paramount and the Peacock because of soccer So if that is why I do not, that is why I do not see that much, you know what I mean?"" [Agent] ""There you go. Mhm."" [Customer] ""You can only watch so much TV if you want to actually make a living and eat. Um,"" [Agent] ""I feel you."" [Customer] ""Yeah, um, OK. And And what about phones with cell phones up to, I, I would want probably X, not X."" [Agent] ""Well, um OK, OK, so that is $45 line when you order two lines, it actually goes down to $30 per line, so it would be $30 plus XX the taxes on that I would say about $65 Um, you still get $40 off on the internet service, so I could potentially get you two cell phones, um, for $25 on the lines and depending on you wanting to buy cell phones or have your own devices, it would just be that."" [Customer] ""Mhm. No, we have our own devices."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so so far."" [Customer] ""We have our own devices. The ques the question is what does that, I guess how much you say it is unlimited?"" [Agent] ""It is unlimited talk, data and text you get XX gigs of premium data There is an unlimited max which gives you XX gigs of premium data if you are working from home where you have Wi Fi availability to you at all times, you are connected to your Wi Fi network to begin with and then your data you use when you are out and about"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""So you can go with the XX and then if you ever need to change it within a billing cycle, call up mobile support, change the um change the the plan and that one's also no contract and no cancellation charges."" [Customer] ""OK, and OK. So what are we at now with um."" [Agent] ""So the uh the cell phone is a different order form. Let me finish this one up so that I can then have a business internet fixed internet to add to the mobile one and that way when the mobile is activated, it links to your um fixed internet service and it gives you your additional discount on it. So am I leaving the TV service on? Am I removing it? Am I modifying it? What am I doing with that?"" [Customer] ""OK, um. I think it was The the XXX X, I think, is the one."" [Agent] ""The difference in price is $182."" [Customer] ""No, there is 1.60 versus. No, no, um,"" [Agent] ""The price that I gave you originally, the XXXX the XXX."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Um, $95 included the package that was the value package which is the $145 for the TV. Remember it is $145 for the TV, $14 for the boxes, $9.95 to duplicate the channels, so the TV package in total was $182. So am I putting that back on we will go ahead and pick an installation date"" [Customer] ""Well, so it was that, so the XXX was not the premium package, it was the other package. There were X Right? It is a step below, whatever that was. And then the static IT. With you said one gig, one and one IP one address. Um, And then phones Yeah, cause I I have got, I have got XX notes now."" [Agent] ""Do you want me, do you want me to recap your pricing once again including the value package? You should not because we have not spoken about that many different pricing options so let us reel it in. OK, so installation one time charge of 129.95. Monthly rate $362.95 estimated taxes $15.41. That package is with the value package that I originally presented to you. If you wanted to go up to the preferred package, then we would go ahead and switch that around for you."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""And it would be literally like a XX somewhat dollar price difference because it is from $145 to $160 so we are leaving it at the value package for the time being is that correct"" [Customer] ""Right. Yeah."" [Agent] ""OK, so you see, very simple no problem That price of 362.95 includes, of course, your internet service, your modem, your router, from your technical support, of course, um, your connection fail over service, your static IP, and the one dial tone that we had originally spoken about. Again to your promotion without any contracts or cancellation charges, um, and let me go ahead and now get to the calendar page."" [Customer] ""OK.""

Um, a printer. And um I, I do not think cameras are necessary right now I am going to have Wi Fi like, like music OK. OK, Wi Fi, yeah, so people usually are streaming music. They usually might have like a Wi Fi thermostat. Now for you, are you going to also share um Wi Fi with, with guests or clients while they are, while they are on the property? I would hope so because they do sometimes want it because they, they want, you know, the procedures sometimes take off and then they ask what the Wi Fi is, that'd be great. Yeah, exactly. You want people also to, you know, people want to check their emails or stream or, you know, do whatever it is that we as humans do, uh, so yeah, you will be able to do that as well. Um, OK, so let me just see here, and I wanted to see at max how many people would you say would be on the network or using the internet at once? X to X max. OK, X to X max, no problem. So allow me to look into a couple of things, uh, for you, Isabel, just to see, um, when we can get out to you and then I will be able to review pricing and everything with you. Now usually on business accounts and it is up to you, um, some people use an EIN, some people use the tax ID some people use their social So whichever one you want to use is totally up to you. I will just collect that from you later on, uh, if you, you know, if we are going to set things up for you just wanted to give you a heads up. OK, no problem. You got it so let me see what we can do uh for you and see uh when we can get out to you, uh, so just bear with me a few moments. OK. Thank you. One moment. Now, uh, Mrs. Bell, I wanted to ask you your current clients or, um, you know, with regard to the business, anyone that contacts you, do you, do they reach you on your cell or, um, is there like an office contact that you have for them? Uh, how do clients reach you? Yeah, I have a business number. OK, excellent now um who is and who is the carrier that you have services with right now? You Have. OK awesome so for you, um on this side, I am going to let you know the package that um this comes with normally comes with a phone. Some people use it for a fax, some people use it for an emergency line and whatnot that, you know, it is totally up to you. It does come bundled in. For you though, because you are a new business with us, you are also going to be eligible for Optimum Business Mobile, which you can get a new iPhone, a new Android, or, um, you know, just to save you a couple bucks, you can bring a phone over to us as long as it is unlocked and paid for. So you obviously can keep your phone number. And um you know usually people want to make a transition and put everything under one umbrella so I just wanted to bring that to your attention. It does appear uh that we uh you know, I would be able to get you a cell phone or to bring you over as well today um but let me just um. Give you your options with regard to internet and connectivity. OK. Alright, so normally I would go with the one gig that is going to be the fastest internet available uh in your area. Now, uh, the one gig, um, I am thinking that that would be uh the best situation for you. Um, the X gig, uh, with the backup promo is going to come with a gateway router modem that is about XXX. Now when I had spoken with you though, and you said that you are going to have X people max on the network though that is actually making a case for the XXX. Now again I would rather you go with the gig because it is going to be the fastest in your area just in case you add anything else but um because you are only going to have X to X people max, um, you know, you do have a printer, uh, you probably have um, you know, you are going to do some streaming and things like that. The XXX is not only suitable enough for you. Um, but it is going to be able to, uh, assist you with any guests that you have on a property. Uh, also, there is no contract associated with this. So if you did want to upgrade to the gig, I can do that with you in the future. It is just based on what you said, it seems like the XXX would be the best fit for you. Now for me, I was not certain if you had electricity at the facility when you wanted to have services installed Yeah, I have, I have electricity now you guys can come in any time What is the pricing for the XXX per month? So the pricing for the XXX is going to be XXX, uh, that is going to include, um, you know, as I said everything I mentioned it is going to include the, the backup, the fail over also, um, you obviously the phone phone line comes bundled in, um, so everything's going to be an all in one there is a one time install of XXX bucks It is XXX per month. Yeah, so it is $150 monthly. If you were to sign up for auto pay, they give you $5 off and uh if you bought a phone over to us, uh, with the $500 you would get an additional $20 off your uh your internet bill as well. OK, and you do not have any, see I am not there full time I, I am not there. I am the business is only I am only there Let me, let me talk to my business partner and see. How many days are you there actually? I did not even know that. I am sorry. I thought this was like, you know, X or X days. Yeah. How many days are you there? So I, I am just splitting it with a partner now and maybe we can split it so I am there two days a week right now until until June. And your partner just to ask how many um are are they having around the same clientele max as you? Yeah, yeah, we are just starting out so. So, so if you are just starting out, I am going to put you in a our basic tier of internet which is our XXX. Now normally I would not have you do that, but it is just based on the nature of your business and your clientele. It is like a more intimate setting so like when we have like psychiatrists or therapists or things like that. We can give them a set up that gives them the juice that they need, but it does give them enough to um to acquiesce to their clients as well. So let me put you into the XXX because it is going to be a lower price point and you are not there in the building occupying it you have a partner, so this will be palatable for the both of you Just bear with me a few moments. Because all I really need it for is also supposed to run payments. Sometimes my Wi Fi just does not want to work like the my phone, my my hotspot, so I just need that. Yeah, the LTE. Yeah. Yeah, you just need something consistent so this is what this is what I am going to do. I am going to look because I know we had a XXX promo so let me just see if that is still available just give me a couple of seconds I will be right back OK, sure. Thanks OK, Isabel, so this is what I am able to do for you, um, based on what you said, you are, you are in there, you know, a couple days a week, you have a partner you know you have X to X people get you have that POS system you are going to be doing a little streaming You are making an awesome case for the XXX. Uh, the XXX internet's going to come with the XXX upload. It is going to come with XX downloads so you will be able to stream They will be able to do their selfies or whatever it is that they want to do. Um, but also it is going to come, uh, with that phone line as well, so that phone line again emergency fax, whatever you want to utilize it for it it is going to be available. Uh, this, uh, price point again is going to be $90 so it is $85 with auto pay. You can sign up for auto pay if you want. Uh, there is no payment due today there is no contract there is a one time install of $100 so there would be no payment due to the tech Everything will come on a pro-rated bill. And um I am not sure when you wanted to have a services schedule we do have uh some openings this week we can get out to you rather quickly OK. Um, Now what I am also going to do though is I am going to email you directly so that say you know a couple weeks out or a couple of months out if you do want to upgrade or if you do want to make any changes as your account manager I just ask that you email me directly so I can just take care of it for you. Give me X 2nd. Uh, just, yeah, sure, give me one second. I am wanting to. Yeah, take your time, no problem. Uh You said it is $85 a month? Yes, so with auto pay it is 85% without autopay it is XX. OK, so you said you are going to email me all all the details? Well yeah I am going to once you select the date and the time I am going to send you like a test email that just obviously give you the specifics uh you know I always provide my clients with their account number and uh their pin just in case so that they do not forget it they have a record of it and uh yeah if you need to make any changes you need anything else, you just reply to the email For me, I just was not, um, are you going to be on site is your partner going to be on site because I have you listed as the contact person I just need to confirm the date and time I will need you to reply to the email because I am going to need your tax ID, EIN or social for your account Got it. OK, yeah, give me one second. Yeah sure take your time just, you know, I am just notating the email that I am going to send out to you in a few moments. OK. Um, I do not know like how I am sharing space with her, so I do not know how dependent she is on Wi Fi. Mhm. Um, is there a way that I, that we could that you could call me back or I could call you back to finalize the decision because if she said that she is heavily on on like um on use of Wi Fi, then, then, you know, we might have to up it to the XXX, but if she said that we are OK with the XXX, then, then that is it. Mhm. Um, regardless, would it be OK for you? So yeah, we could Go ahead, I am sorry. Yeah, would you be able to call me back? I could just give you an answer whether I am going to go through with it or not. Well yeah that is what I am, that is what I am trying to do now. You just let me know the date and time and I will set it up and I will set it up at the XXX and if you want to change to the XXX then I will just update it and just confirm the pricing with you. That is not an issue. I just want to make sure that I have you set up, um, you know, for things to get booked, so yeah, there is no contract so say um I do not have to set it up for tomorrow. Tomorrow I could set it up for Friday or Thursday or even next week if you email me in XX minutes you say hey Ron is Thursday still available I am not going to say oh man you know Isabel's emailing me again I got to do my job so it is all good. I am going to email you whatever date you decide is fine and if you need an update or if you need to make any changes then I will make the changes for you. Let me ask you one more question. Um, if I need to, like, let us just say, you know, whatever, if I need to cancel it, is there you said there is no cost can cancel any time. Sure. Yeah. Yep, so it would be the same thing. I would ask I always ask, you know, not that I am like an ego tripping guy I always just ask that you email me because yeah, you could call in and then you are probably going to get a queue or put on hold or you could just email me and say, hey Ron, uh, we want to cancel or we want to do this or we want to do that and I will arrange a way to call you back or to set it up again, like I said, I am your account manager. You do not have to speak to me I, I would recommend that you just email me if you need something Right, OK, no problem. Alright, and I will also put in the email as well that there is no contract you are free to make changes any time Alright, so I am in the office. OK, so do you have availability for tomorrow? I do. I have X to XX. I have XX to X actually we are, we are both in the Northeast I actually have X to X as well um, so I do not know which one works for you would you say Did you say somebody's going to come in physically? Well, yes, someone's going to come as long as this is what I tell my clients, as long as you have someone that looks like an adult that is there, that is, that is all we need, you know, because sometimes they want to slide out or if you are not going to be there, we need to schedule it where someone's going to physically be there because they will they will call you XX minutes prior. Yeah. They are not going to just pop up we do need someone to physically be there OK, yeah, I will be there tomorrow. OK, yeah, and you do not have to do anything. They are not going to ask you to hold a hammer or to do any you know, move a ladder They are not going to ask you to do anything. They just want to make sure you are there. Yeah, yeah I am, I am there tomorrow OK, so what time do you think you want the X to XX, the XX to X, or the X to X? Um, XX to X. OK, so I am going to now also keep in mind if you email me in XX minutes and you want X to X, you know, as long as X to X is available I can change it so do not, you know, there is no issue. That is good. Alright, so you are all set. Uh, as I said, there is no payment due. I am only going to need the tax ID. You can send me that another time, but I do need you to set up a X digit PIN, Isabel, for you to give, um, you can give that to your partner as well, but please give me a X digit pin that you can remember because this is going to be assigned to your account. Oh my gosh, listen, I just remembered I on the phone tomorrow, so I will not, I, I, I do not want to be late. So let us do X to X tomorrow. OK, switching it to X to X, very easy, no problem, X to X. What is that, uh, pin number? And we call it an access code so you know when we when you call in they are going to ask you. OK, uh, it is going to be, it is going to be, um, does it have to be like a tricky number? No, do not please do not make it tricky. Make it a number that you are going to remember. Do not trick yourself because you are going to call in tomorrow and not know. I have been through it dozens of times. OK. All right. XXXX. XXXX, it is not going to let me use that it is not going to let me use consecutive digits. OK, so let us do um. XX XXXX.

[Customer] ""Sure, I am working remotely today my cell number is XXX XXX-XXX-X"" [Agent] ""Thank you. OK, what I will do is if you can share with me kindly your address, let us see what services are available, um, with the fiber, so whenever you are ready I can take down the address."" [Customer] ""Sure. It is XXX. South Allen, A L L E N R. Flat Rock, North Carolina XXXXX"" [Agent] ""Thank you, so the zip code is XXXXX?"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Alright, and by chance what type of business do you have at this location?"" [Customer] ""It is a dental office."" [Agent] ""OK, alright, let me just take a look at our system and I will see what options we have available. How the what services do you currently use for your internet at this location?"" [Customer] ""Uh, we have, um, internet. Through AT&T, uh, basic internet, but since Helene, it is been very damaged and it is"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Based on a timeline I am getting stuff fixed and everything in our office runs off the internet, the phones, our practice management software, everything."" [Agent] ""Got it. Yeah, we have been getting a lot of customers in your area, um, that they, they are interested in using our services. So are you with Upwards Dental?"" [Customer] ""I am."" [Agent] ""OK, um, well, here is what we have. There is two options. One, we do have the same speeds, um, the download speed that we offer through fiber, um, is just delivered through the coax, so you get the best of both worlds. Um, we do offer a gigabyte of internet speed, it is available for you, um, it is just not through the fiber, so it is, it will be delivered through a coax line, um, but the good news is just like the fiber, a gig on fiber, a gig on. Uh, coax is the same speed, um, the only difference is how it is delivered, which with us we also include, uh, for additional fee you can get the internet backup so that even if there was an outage, a lot of our business customers in your location having that backup in addition to the gig, they are still operating even though everyone else is still experiencing interruptions in the Internet service, so we have that available for you now for your upwards dental practice."" [Customer] ""But you do not have fiber?"" [Agent] ""Yes and no. The, the network is fiber, but from the demont to your location it is going to go through the coax. So fiber just simply means that it is converted inside your location, um, whereas in with the coax it is fiber to the Dmark and from the demon, the wires are coax. However, they are not with they are much stronger than, uh, a phone company's internet connection. So like AT&T, um, you know, those, um, phone companies. They do not have the same PBMs like we have, so you get fiber and you get us, we are like the top that you can possibly get and to back it up, we got, um, right now you, if you sign back up and we install the service for you, you can enjoy I know this promise."" [Customer] ""What was that?"" [Agent] ""So basically we do not want you to feel like you are locked into any contract. We, we, we want to assure you that our services are the best and that your business is going to benefit from it. So when we install the service, you do not have to pay any money up front we let you and your practice use the service up to XX days If in the XX days you decide you do not like it, it could be actually even on the 30th day. You, you are protecting what I know is promised, which means you can cancel the service without any obligations. You pick up the equipment, you will not have to pay a penny usually you would know by our connection of our internet within the first day or two whether or not we are as good as we say we are So the no risk promise gives you an opportunity to utilize the service, enjoy it then, you know, make the decision So we could put you in our program right now the good news is that we are not dependent on anything from AT&T So while AT&T customers in your area are experiencing an outage, we can send our technicians out there um, we got our own technicians, our own network we could get you up and running as soon as possible"" [Customer] ""What um What is the fee for something like this per month you said it is still one gig?"" [Agent] ""It is the X gig. The fiber is not available yet in your area. Um, I can not see any the the forecast does not show us that it is going to be there anytime soon. Um, we got, we got a few hurdles to get through, but in terms of the X gig, let me give you the promotion rates that we are offering for new customers you will qualify even though you know we have service with your business in the past, you definitely qualify for a new promotional offer Let me just see what we can do this, um, do for you, um, question while I do have you on the line, do you remember how much you were spending um for what speed you currently have with um AT&T"" [Customer] ""I actually do not know what speed we have. I know that it is with copper lines. And um I pay $60 a month."" [Agent] ""OK, OK, $60 a month. OK, OK, let me just see what we can do here for you. Just give me a moment. Yeah, but the AT&T lines, we get so many of the, uh, AT&T customers in your area, we get them in droves, mostly business and residential customers, um, give us a call. Uh let me just take a look here. I want to see what is the lowest rate we can offer to you for as well as um how soon we can get someone out there. Now the battery backup that we include um with the gig you can do both and it would be for $100. Uh, let me just see."" [Customer] ""$100 a month for both?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, for both, let me see if I can do the discount. Give me one moment, OK, Taha, I am going to place you on hold and let me just punch in some codes to see what we can discount this for."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Alright, one moment. OK, yeah, thank you for your patience. So with the promotional discounts and rate it comes up to $100."" [Customer] ""OK, and tell me what that includes."" [Agent] ""That is the gigabyte of internet that includes your modem that includes your router, it comes with a secure net, um, and it is unlimited, meaning we do not bottleneck the speeds no matter how much you use the internet."" [Customer] ""And then what about the upload and download speeds? What are those?"" [Agent] ""So it is a gigabyte download the upload side is XX, XX megs upload"" [Customer] ""XX or XX."" [Agent] ""XXX"" [Customer] ""And is this like my current internet, I was told when I was talking to them the other day."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""That I do not have any dedicated service to my building, so basically everybody on our road, which literally is everybody, um, they all have AT&T we are all sharing the same line Um, how to there to what you have."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Oh thank you. That that is exactly what the most common issues with the AT&T uh network is with us. We have a PVN so even though we send the internet through coax from the DMO, our network on the back end is fiber, so it does not matter. You can have an entire, you know, uh, two main person city. Everyone's on the internet. No one's going to be able to tell that other people are on the internet because it is all separated. So it is not it it does not, our internet is not enact the way uh AT&T does. And that is why we have so much, you know, a high request in your area, uh, for our internet service."" [Customer] ""OK. So $100 a month, so if I signed up. Today you said I had XX days risk free, no money up front to try it out."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""And then say I like it how how long do I have to sign a contract for or is it? Month to month."" [Agent] ""Great question. So it is definitely it is month to month. Um, you do not have to sign any contract. And you will, um, It is month to month you do not have to sign any contract"" [Customer] ""the rate is good for X years there is no contractual obligation So at any time we have a different offer or you find the service you want that is better you can always migrate to that. So like if you do get fiber in our area and we wanted to upgrade to that. Oh absolutely, you, you would be the first one on the list we would reach out to you and let you know, um, especially when you have an active account with us, we will let you know that hey, listen, this is going to uh be available for you such as date and time, and then that is when we will go ahead and I will give you a call and make sure you if you are interested in it. So yeah, you are definitely going to be included with that information. OK, and then one last question, so if I signed up today, when could someone be out there? Mhm. Just set it up.

[Agent] ""OK, so you have, you have, you have, you wanted port over two phone numbers as cell phones that is separate from the landline, is that correct?"" [Customer] ""And I would like that. That is correct I want internet"" [Agent] ""OK And you want the Internet, OK, alright, so let us first start with the internet and the phone line, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Alright, so a couple of things. The, the fastest speed that we have is a gig, OK? It is XXXX megabytes over XX, OK? We provide you the modem and the router, um, it is a X year promotion. There is no contract, the phone line is unlimited anywhere in the United States, OK we give you Wi Fi service for free, OK Um, normally, OK, it is $160 what I am going to do actually is I am going to give you a better promotion I am going to reduce that by $40 and I am going to give you that for $120 OK?"" [Customer] ""OK, do you have a uh."" [Agent] ""Um"" [Customer] ""$60 plan or do you provide a veteran's discount? I have veterans ID."" [Agent] ""Well we do have a, yes we do have it for a slower speed, OK, so we do have something where it is uh internet and the phone line, it is XXX megabytes over XX, um, it is not $60 but the monthly bill is $80 a month."" [Customer] ""OK, and that will provide streaming service for approximately X hours and X hours worth of uh. Emails and uh Facebooking."" [Agent] ""OK, yeah, yeah, I mean that that should that should be fine again we provide you the modem and the router, um again we will provide you the, the equipment and everything"" [Customer] ""OK, um, so you said it is XXX megabytes?"" [Agent] ""Yes, now, here, here is the thing though, if you do the gig, right, because you said you are transferring cell phone numbers over, is that correct?"" [Customer] ""That is correct."" [Agent] ""You have your own cell phones?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, I have one cell phone and a dual SI."" [Agent] ""OK, when you say do what does that mean? I am sorry."" [Customer] ""So you can have X numbers ported to X cell phone with a dual SIM, so it is X numbers that you can call into one cell phone."" [Agent] ""OK, um. Alright, so I am not sure how that would work with us. Um,"" [Customer] ""OK, well then you can quote me for just one number that is fine."" [Agent] ""OK, yeah, because it would just be one, so let me, let me explain to you how that would work with the gig because like I said, normally it is XXX because I am reducing it $40 right off the bat and the only reason I am saying that because I am reducing it to $120 like I said, normally it is XXX, and the reason I bring that up is because the cell phone would be $45 a month, OK? Um, unlimited talk, text, and data, and after, after about three billing cycles, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK. Yeah."" [Agent] ""The XXX that we are talking about for your internet and phone for your business at your home that will then get a $40 discount."" [Customer] ""OK, well, uh."" [Agent] ""And that would then be reduced to $80. Where the $300 will not get that $40 discount."" [Customer] ""OK, can I get that in writing so that way. When XX days comes up I can show uh the bill provider that we have this agreement. Will be on"" [Agent] ""Um, yeah, when, when you get your cell phone bill, it, it says it there when you, when you sign up, it will say on the things on the emails it would say that you get a discount off your business account."" [Customer] ""And what are the stipulations to make sure that I receive the promotion."" [Agent] ""There, there is no real stipulation as long as you have the gig speed you have a mobile service, that $40 credit will always be applied"" [Customer] ""And what it said."" [Agent] ""The only, the only stipulation is that you have to wait at least X billing mobile billing cycles. That is it."" [Customer] ""OK, and when does the first billing cycle begin?"" [Agent] ""When you get your first mobile, so I mean is if we sign up today, it takes about XX hours for you to be able to activate it. And then you are then you then you are then you get, you know, then we start billing you so it is when you get your first bill and then your second bill, then your 3rd bill. And then you will see that credit added on to your um monthly you know added on to your um on to your business account."" [Customer] ""OK, so it is $45 for the mobile phone."" [Agent] ""Right, and then."" [Customer] ""It is X $120 for the uh XGB of internet and the landline."" [Agent] ""Right."" [Customer] ""And then you said that you have a discount on the uh what is the veteran's discount 10%."" [Agent] ""No, and not a veteran is, it is not a discount. It, it, so there is no veteran's discount. What I am saying to you is I am giving you a $40 discount right off the bat from $160 to $120 then like I said, after about three billing cycles You will get $40 off that $120 because you have cell phone service with us."" [Customer] ""All right."" [Agent] ""And so that $120 will go down to $80."" [Customer] ""OK, but it is still XXX because you have to include the phone, right? The the mobile"" [Agent] ""No, well, I mean, I, I, I, I, I separated because it is a separate bill. Cell phone is a separate bill from your business account."" [Customer] ""OK, so how much in total will I pay to off to them for both bills?"" [Agent] ""Well, again, if you, if you really want to look at it, you will be paying again $120 for your business account $45 for your cell phone, right? But then you will get the $40 discount off your bills you would be down to $80 if you want to add, if you want to combine them again, you will be going up to $120 you know, $45 plus the $80 you know, it will be $125."" [Customer] ""OK, does that include service fees and tax?"" [Agent] ""No, uh, with, uh, with, so again your cell phone bill $45 that comes out to like $52."" [Customer] ""OK, so for $152 for the 1st X months and then after that it is supposed to go down to $112 monthly. For how long? The length of the contract, the length of renewal."" [Agent] ""And then again it is $120 for your business your internet and your phone and then after X months that will get a $40 discount be brought down to $80 with tax roughly about $90.92 dollars."" [Customer] ""What the so which is. $130?"" [Agent] ""No, no, $52. No, cell phone is $52 ma'am. Your internet and your phone, once the $40 discount is applied, will be about $92.93 ma'am."" [Customer] ""OK, so that is like $140. Right?"" [Agent] ""No, a little bit more again with taxes, man, XX."" [Customer] ""Uh"" [Agent] ""Once the $40 credit is applied. And then XX for your cell phone there."" [Customer] ""OK, so it was."" [Agent] ""So around $145 with taxes and everything."" [Customer] ""OK, so I paid the X, XXX for X months. And then after you are going to deduct an additional $40 do I still maintain $150"" [Agent] ""So again then I let, let, let us start again. It is it is start to start off from day one. It is $120 for your internet and your phone for the gig, OK."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""OK, it is $45 for your cell phone."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""We understand. OK, alright, this is not with taxes and anything yet, just leave it like that for a minute."" [Customer] ""OK, oK, so it is XXX for X months and then after it goes down to XX for total for optimum paying that both uh. The landline and the internet is XXX and then the cell phone is XX so I the one OK I pay the XXX for X months."" [Agent] ""That is correct."" [Customer] ""And then after X months I pay XXX.""

I will give you a credit of $99.99 dollars."" [Customer] ""OK, now do I have to set it up or you got to set it up as part of that credit?"" [Agent] ""I am sorry?""

[Customer] ""You know you can always watch what is going out And I understand we have currently have coaxial cable I am checking to see if you have fiber available"" [Agent] ""Right. I am checking. Give me one moment, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Thank you."" [Customer] ""And over here, um, I have just got on side. I like to spand here. It is more and they tell us what the speed is and and move it up versus."" [Agent] ""OK"" [Customer] ""They got cable. Bandwidth that is what I was thinking when I was looking at the speeds of cable it is uh. Up to like X gig your fiber is like X, is that correct? That is what I was looking at yeah. You should the DSL it is like a XXX megabyte."" [Agent] ""Alright, so, um. OK, so I see you are currently on XXX megs, um."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Where he had a bag The time and see even."" [Agent] ""So according to my footprint here, uh, there is currently no fiber in the area just yet."" [Customer] ""Mhm. The Yeah"" [Agent] ""Um, so."" [Customer] ""Well, let me ask you about the cable. It is XXX meg the highest that you can get, or is there a setting any?"" [Agent] ""No, no way, um, no, yeah, we can get you up to a gig here. And then"" [Customer] ""And how does that affect"" [Agent] ""So you, you will you will you will see an an increase in performance when it comes to your download speed and upload speed. So, um, obviously if you are doing a lot of emails back and forth you will see an improvement in that if you are doing, um, any sort of uh video calls for your church services you will see an improvement in that and how that functions, um."" [Customer] ""No, I"" [Agent] ""It is a faster internet all around, wider bandwidth, so, you know, even like your, your congregation can hook into the Wi Fi if they, if they want to hook their cellphones on and things like that."" [Customer] ""Mm What What would be the change in fees if we go to the one gigahertz?"" [Agent] ""You have plenty of bandwidth for, for that as well. Um, that is an excellent question. Just give me a moment here to. To kind of dial that in and I will let you know in a second."" [Customer] ""Mm"" [Agent] ""Mm."" [Customer] ""Yeah I I am going to go ahead if you yeah OK it if it if it is not that much more than we can evaluate one other option yeah way that if you. It back up on them. Yeah, I am, I am thinking that, uh, if we could look at another church I got her then I can think of At least double what it should be at its current. So you think we will get the close go over this XXX. And you do not do anything I would say without us really having access to provision we we are just shooting in the dark. Some days we do not need that. Some days we probably need that plus, uh, you know, without any data it is hard to really but we sell one option, but what I was thinking is it is not complete dollars like they know that and if it goes to X gig and that is only like $100 a month that I could do that right now it is difficult we have to get anything done. I would say we will go ahead and do that while we are doing the whole research and also we have any information to the passwords or something we can get to the to the route For only like here. OK And salesman that be another way. I lost the whole thing when I got one of these other calls, you know, but I still got them, I think. Just checking to make sure we are still connected."" [Agent] ""Yep, I am right here just give me one moment."" [Customer] ""Right So, uh, no, no problem."" [Agent] ""P Appreciate you."" [Customer] ""I, I, I was on earlier with somebody and I lost it when I got another call. I just want to make sure that it happened again."" [Agent] ""Uh, no, yeah, we are all good. I appreciate that."" [Customer] ""I"" [Agent] ""not to OK, so let me just make sure. This goes through I can give you the quote here"" [Customer] ""Please do not find a pen."" [Agent] ""Uh. Oh Alright, um, so James, it looks like to upgrade. To upgrade your internet from XXX megs to XGB, which is XXXX MBs, so it is 3.5 times the speed, 3.5 times the bandwidth. So it is a pretty decent sized upgrade there. Um, Just hold on X 2nd. HG HG is there. So it is looking like the upgrade is only going to be an additional around $67 more."" [Customer] ""OK, XX."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so, um, essentially what it is going to what we are going to do is we are going to swap out your modem going to get you the modem that is compatible for the gig. It is also going to include our 24/7 support and protection and our business wireless connection backup, which is actually, it is a backup modem in the event that your main internet were to go out, this backup modem automatically turns on so that way you do not lose any sort of connectivity. If you are in the middle of a church service or anything like that, you still stay connected here. And it is just going to be an additional $67 a month on top of the monthly bill, um, the installation fee for that is normally $100 but I can waive that for you. And then we can get you on an install. On Wednesday, so a week, a week from today."" [Customer] ""That sounds good, uh."" [Agent] ""OK cool."" [Customer] ""We would like to go ahead and have that done."" [Agent] ""Sounds good, um, go ahead."" [Customer] ""Um, Um I do, you know, we are church, so what we will have to do, and Wednesday is a good day because there it is normally manned on Wednesday, at least from."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Great. Mhm."" [Customer] ""Oh, mid morning till mid afternoon, uh."" [Agent] ""Right."" [Customer] ""So that would be great."" [Agent] ""Sounds good. Alright, let us lock this in here once again there is no contract with Optimum, uh, so you can make changes at any time. If it is not working for you, obviously you can go back to what you had, but it seems like you are looking for something a little bit better. So the gig is definitely the way to go here then obviously once fiber becomes available, you can migrate to fiber you can get up to X gigs"" [Customer] ""Yeah, that is what I wanted to I wanted to make sure that it was with no contract so if fiber did become available either by you or someone else that um."" [Agent] ""Right. Absolutely."" [Customer] ""We did not have a contract, OK."" [Agent] ""Absolutely, yeah, you are good to go on that. There is never any contracts with Optum. You will never have any contracts with us. We are anti-contract over here."" [Customer] ""Oh well, that is good."" [Agent] ""And then, um, just, uh, also you can save an additional XX bucks on your account here because you are going with the X gig plan. You can save an additional $40 on your monthly bill if you bundle in your mobile phone. So if you were to switch your mobile company from your current provider to Optimum Mobile and we connected to the account here for living for the brand church. You will start to receive a $40 discount on this bill and then the cost of your mobile line is only $45 for unlimited data, talk and texting when you bring over your current device, so it could be a win-win situation here for you."" [Customer] ""Well, we do not currently have any uh mobiles on our account, but can I do this at a later date if we decided to add one and have it applied to the."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Yeah, it is it is always available for you."" [Customer] ""OK, and that, and what is the, what is the mobile carrier?"" [Agent] ""Uh, we partnered with T-Mobile."" [Customer] ""T-Mobile."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so we are on the T-Mobile network. Um, who do you have right now for your mobile phone?"" [Customer] ""Well, all of us just have individual mobile phones. We do not have a church mobile phone."" [Agent] ""Right, so like, uh, you can even bring you, James, you can even bring your personal mobile phone over and switch it to a business mobile account and we connect it to the to the business and you can do that as well. You do not have to have like a dedicated cell phone for the church unless you wanted one. Um,"" [Customer] ""Well, we might. I need to visit with the preacher and others, uh, we may very well take advantage of this, this offering you have, uh, because if I am following it, make sure I am not misunderstanding if I am following you basically would only be paying."" [Agent] ""Got Oh nice. Yeah, for sure, uh."" [Customer] ""$5 more a month. In total, so, uh, and have a mobile phone."" [Agent] ""Correct."" [Customer] ""Want to go down $40 want to go up from X to XX, which would be $5 more a month than you that OK."" [Agent] ""XX, right, right, exactly, exactly, exactly. No it but it is still broken up into two separate bills, but that is pretty much the gist of it behind, yeah, yeah, mhm."" [Customer] ""I understand. I understand that it is uh but we are very cost conscious here in the church so that is the easiest way for me to represent it is for $5 more we could get a mobile phone."" [Agent] ""No I got you. No, yeah. No, yeah, of course. Right, absolutely, and yeah, I, I am from New York City, so I have set up uh plenty of churches here, so, um, a lot of them do take advantage of that deal because not only are you saving $40 on your monthly bill for the church, you know, you got your, you got your dedicated cell phone for the church just in case you need that, you know what I mean?"" [Customer] ""Right, no, that is right."" [Agent] ""Um, OK, oh No, I understand."" [Customer] ""I like, um, I am going to pass that on. I just can not commit to that now."" [Agent] ""Um, what is, so I have an email address here as LFT GALS@yahoo.com. Is that the best email?"" [Customer] ""Uh Is there any way to have more than one email you can only have one email"" [Agent] ""Uh, it is only one email that gets sent, you know, you get sent all the all the stuff you know, the bills, the, the whatever marketing"" [Customer] ""But I can change that at any time, is that correct?"" [Agent] ""Yes you can."" [Customer] ""I am, I am going to give you my email because we have gotten lost here being able to contact with y'all. It is an unmonitored email address that you have that is LFTB gals right at yahoo.com."" [Agent] ""Yeah Cool. Right, right. Yep."" [Customer] ""And uh it is on monitored and it is it my email would be much much better."" [Agent] ""Yeah, cool, what is your email?"" [Customer] ""And It is James."" [Agent] ""Mhm.""

[Customer] ""That Let, let me ask you, let me ask a question here just uh because we can not afford to have any problems on the switch over."" [Agent] ""Yeah, go ahead. Mhm. Absolutely."" [Customer] ""They nothing will change as far as our other than having a new modem we will not see any change in um."" [Agent] ""No."" [Customer] ""Our emails that come here, any of our internet, all the IP addresses and all of that, we should be."" [Agent] ""No. Hello. No, you just have one I you should be good to go.

So you have your tech guy as well and now you are also going to have the protection for not just the optimum equipment but any eligible devices and I believe that PSX actually may even be covered in there, um, but I will look into that. Now, uh, because you have, uh, cameras and that is about XX cameras, um, we usually. Include a static IP in this program, but since you have like XX or in a XX range, this is going to include a static IP of X so it is going to allow the cameras to be able to monitor and do what they need to do and not interfere with your Internet connection. Now the only thing that it is not included in your promo."" [Customer] ""OK great."" [Agent] ""And, and also I just wanted to give you a heads up that uh there is no contract you are going to receive pro rated coverage so any event that you wanted to modify or change or even cancel any of your services, especially in regards to your protection and support, you would be able to be credited back whatever was not used We do want to make sure not only that we are servicing your equipment but you have the protection and support that you need, um.""

Now you are going to have the bandwidth to support uh any additional guests or clients at the same time though, if you want something separate I guess Wi Fi that is like an additional $40 per month. So right now, um, you do not, you do not have that and if you wanted to we could add that. Um, but without adding anything, uh, you would be at $250 even, um, there is a one time install of just $100 and everything would go on a prorated bill. So, um, if you sign up for auto pay, that is up to you they would give you a $5 discount there is no payment due today there is no payment due to the tech, uh, you would receive a bill you could set up payment as you see fit there"" [Customer] ""Got you, so XXX per month. Um, I did see something online like when I was clicking to sort of try to get in contact with you guys. It said something along the lines of $100 per month plus I think it was like $30 for X static IP addresses. That was for the XGB. I do not know if that is you. Not a promo that applies to this or?"" [Agent] ""OK, so and you said this was online that you saw?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, it was XXX bucks per month for the 1st X years, um, X gig. Uh, with the static IP for an extra XX bucks.""

That is the main reason we are doing this."" [Customer] ""Mhm, OK."" [Agent] ""Alright, so just bear with me one second here and then you said the the the internet goes out from time to time as well?"" [Customer] ""Mhm. Yeah."" [Agent] ""OK, so we actually have a new device that came out this year. It is an emergency connection backup, so it is a it is a device that if the internet goes down this will pop on and keep your card system going. So you will not have"" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK."" [Agent] ""which is most important, you know what I mean, uh, so it is, uh, you know, basically like how your cell phone goes from, uh. You know, Wi Fi to data if there is no service is very much like that."" [Customer] ""Mhm mhm."" [Agent] ""OK, so let me get this set up here and then. Now on the day of install is it best for the technician to call the number you gave me the XXXX?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, so the He is going to there to replace where, where he is going to go"" [Agent] ""Yeah, they will get, yeah, you are going to get, you are going to get new equipment and you are going to get new everything because you are like I said you are going to get new better equipment and it is going to, it is going to significantly, it is going to significantly increase everything across the board."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Your phone number, the phone and everything is going to stay the same."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I mean you still only need the one line do you need? Uh, do you need a second like rollover line or?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, what is that that is going to cost more, right? Or?"" [Agent] ""Well, if you, if you had a phone line, yeah, but now there is another question do you have mobile for the business?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, I the mobile or my mobile like cellphone."" [Agent] ""OK, yeah, like or a tablet. The reason I am saying is now when you upgrade to the gig, right, if I give, if you upgrade to the gig, I can give you a $40 discount on the internet price if you added a mobile or tablet line. That is another part of the business."" [Customer] ""Uh, no, no, not mobile, just, yeah, just for the business."" [Agent] ""That is fine. OK, so, so you, you are due for like I said, the full upgrade would bring you to the X gig from the XXX speed So the X gig is XXXX, so you are going from XXX to XXXX speed with the product protection, the tech support, and the emergency connection back up, the device I told you that will keep you up and running, and this is even if there is, you know, like there is an accident or something and internet goes out, this will keep you up and running, OK? And the difference is only $75.50 a month."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So I mean"" [Customer] ""$75?"" [Agent] ""$75 more a month, so your new bill would only be $285 and that is why I said if you bundle the mobile line I could give you a $40 discount."" [Customer] ""Uh, you are Yeah, it is expensive, man."" [Agent] ""And, and I understand it because I mean yes the bill does go up, but this is a significant increase in your business because that time lost definitely does, it does pay. I mean, and this you are going to be able to if you want to give your customers access to the Internet you can now you want to stream, you can do that, you know, you are going to have those capabilities and you are going to be upgraded for the foreseeable future. Because if you are not going to have problems you are having now."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Yeah, so you do not have a"" [Agent] ""And that is it and that is there is no contracts, so that is what I am saying try it out, try it out for XX, XX days."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Try it out for X months, you know, and that is the best way to go about it. Then you, when you see the difference, you know what I mean, you are going to, I think you will be very, very happy when you find out that everything's running well, your system's running well, and you do not have those issues anymore."" [Customer] ""Yeah, you do not have it a little more cheaper, that the cheaper one."" [Agent] ""Not that, not I mean. Well, let me, let me see what I can do if, if you want to hang out with a brief hold, let me, let me see what I can do, um. Let me see what I can do here because if there is, there is a XXX speed, OK, and it still is an increase, do not get me wrong, it is, but I would hate to see it not be enough, you know what I mean?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah."" [Agent] ""And then I do not want you to be in the same position you know what I mean"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""It is a, it is it is going to be an increase , uh, you know what I mean"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""It is better if you go down like say we install you with the gig and then you say hey it is too much, then we can lower you down to the XXX a lot easier than if you go to the XXX and you say OK it is not enough, then we have to do a whole another installation, you know what I mean?"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So that that is the only reason why I try. I am just, you know, figuring time, yeah, you know, time wise, you know what I mean, that that is, that is what you do. I mean if you want, I mean I like I said, I can, I can put you at the XXX I mean I would hate to see you sacrifice the service we do not need to"" [Customer] ""So it is more easy to do like for XXXX and after it is too much and I can say to to deliver."" [Agent] ""Then you could say oh if I need to go down to the XXX, yes. It is definitely yeah."" [Customer] ""So that you, you are that the techic he do not need to come back again"" [Agent] ""Then the tech exactly."" [Customer] ""OK. Um, so total yes."" [Agent] ""So, so we would put you through now like I said, we still got time and again there is still no contracts, you know what I mean, so you do not have to worry about that."" [Customer] ""Oh yeah, yeah."" [Agent] ""So it goes month to month."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK, so it does not have any promotion it is going to be a little lower the price what?"" [Agent] ""That that is, I, that is what, and that was with the promotion that is so usually it would be more, but I did. I gave you the promo."" [Customer] ""Oh. OK, so how much is the total, XXX?""

OK, alright, so the system is allowing that one excellent. OK, so is is uh was this art gallery?"" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""Oh awesome. Uh, I, my, uh, my kid's an art student, just, uh, got, well, committed to new pulse upstate wants to go full art. It is awesome ceramics."" [Customer] ""Oh. Wonderful. I hope you are rich."" [Agent] ""Yeah I am not unfortunately that is what um. Yeah, I am, I am on Long Island, so like it is not that far I am like, oh great, terrific I mean they had a great facility and everything. I am like, oh, but uh yeah."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""She wants go to our teacher route but still do the other side, go for it kid that is it. But alright, OK, so when is busiest at the gallery, how many devices are going to be hooked up to the internet and Wi Fi?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, really X Yeah. Um Like that. Like uh color. Um, so maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe X at the most because you square would be."" [Agent] ""Yeah, well, well, thing you are, you are going to have, well, if you can not. OK, so, you know, laptops, if you are going to have a point of sale, wireless printers, cameras."" [Customer] ""Yeah. Yeah Yeah, we just total them all up it is X."" [Agent] ""OK, so that is everything. OK, so we are not having a gaining tournament or anything there, so that is no problem, OK."" [Customer] ""No, no, no, it is, it is little shit."" [Agent] ""Yeah, perfect. OK, alright, but most importantly we are going to make sure we have cameras and everything is high end stuff we got to keep an eye on here right now. Now as far as do you just to make sure we have everything here because if we do that no phones, you do you have mobile for the business? Yeah, like a cell phone or tablet, any line or anything like that?"" [Customer] ""No. She is got a cell phone right now, but I am, I am, it is, it is just I am not sure that she want to swap."" [Agent] ""OK. It is Yeah, well, you do not have to swap it."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I think I might just keep what I have."" [Agent] ""I mean, if you want to add one, you know, or bring in a device you have. Reason I am saying is we could give additional discounts if you bundle the line. We have our, our network and we teamed up with T-Mobile, so we have those, uh, and they work together and then like say for the gig and then I could give a $40 discount, uh, for, you know, just for having the bundle in the line and since it is, you know, I live in Long Island in Connecticut, it is $100 to back, you know, to back out of our driveway."" [Customer] ""I mean I have Mhm."" [Agent] ""That is what, that is why I offer all the savings you can get. Right, so if we go with the XXX speed internet, it is $95. It goes down to $90 once you do the auto pay. That is enough to power everything you have there and then more as the business grows, um, no contracts, so not to worry about anything like that and this price is good for X years."" [Customer] ""And that is XXX."" [Agent] ""Yeah XXX meg yeah."" [Customer] ""And is there anything less than that?"" [Agent] ""Uh, there is, there is XXX, which is, uh, they are basically just entry level, you know, um. Now I will transfer you to that and no phone. But you are setting up cameras, correct?"" [Customer] ""I have cameras, right?"" [Agent] ""OK, are we going to be setting up like a static IP address for security on the on the cameras or no?"" [Customer] ""There is not one here now. I do not think so no. What is the security ID."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""No, I think it is yeah, you will not like these cameras"" [Agent] ""Mhm"" [Customer] ""They are not being on your site, are they? Yeah, they are with, um, Verizon. It was Verizon, not Verizon, they are ADT monitors, OK, um. Yeah, ABT gives me a bill, a separate bill for the cameras, yeah."" [Agent] ""OK, so, so that we might need a static IP address then."" [Customer] ""Let us put it, put it in for now. I, I am not convinced let us go"" [Agent] ""Yeah, I mean, it is easy."" [Customer] ""This is It"" [Agent] ""I mean you could take it away. It is a lot easier than adding it because if we put it on now, add it, you know, you do not have to pay for like a separate install or anything like that. So but not a big deal. And the one static, uh, IP is only XX bucks, so. Oh hold on I got that here. Alright, so with the $300 internet and the static IP, alright, it is $85. It will go down to $80 once you do the auto pay. There is a one-time installation of $100 rolled into the bill, uh. Again, if you do, if, if you bundled the mobile line or tablet line, you could get a $15 discount on this too, so there is still additional savings now on the day of installation, what is the XXX-X the best number to reach you, uh, on the day of install?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, um. So what does this XXX mean? I mean, what does it mean? That is right now your speed is X. Thank you."" [Agent] ""That is it. you got a good you got a good person in your corner right there that bringing"" [Customer] ""So yeah, your XXX will be just fine."" [Agent] ""OK, perfect. Alright, so, so on the day of install is it best to call the XXX-X Carol?"" [Customer] ""OK, yes."" [Agent] ""OK, and I can have someone there Monday. I have XX to X and X to X for the window for Monday."" [Customer] ""Um, do we want to think about this, or do we want to do it? Go for it. Yeah, oK, so it is, so you said the install XXX and then the. And then it is XX if I do an auto pay."" [Agent] ""Auto pay, yeah, a month, yep."" [Customer] ""You, you do not have a discount because stock market crashed."" [Agent] ""Uh, that is the discount because it is so much so."" [Customer] ""That is their special I press it down for you there."" [Agent] ""Yeah Yeah"" [Customer] ""and this is positive I am going to get the X the oh yeah they are yeah yeah there is no question."" [Agent] ""Yeah, you are not going to have any and and there is no contracts so you can upgrade So say, say you go viral, business blows up and you say, hey, I am doing TikToks and you need a you know, to go up to a gig that is you can upgrade to. There is no, there is no penalties or anything for doing that."" [Customer] ""OK, so I have not, um, this has nothing to do with my home phone at my home and nothing separate, OK, OK, and then do I have to call the other company and give them a heads up I am doing this? Yeah, uh, the only person I would call it just maybe. Oh, OK. Alright, um, I am not open on Mondays and Tuesdays, um."" [Agent] ""So Wednesday it is. I have I also have I have X to XX and X to X on Wednesday."" [Customer] ""Um, XX to X on Wednesday. I do not even know where I am on Wednesday, Wednesday. Yeah, X to X on Wednesday, so I am calling ADT and saying what? We just want to tell them that you are going to be changing your service provider and. You need to know. Uh, what they, what they will want to do exchange your on the new service and whether. Uh, and whether they need a static IP. What is static IP? What does that mean? That means that they need to be able to reach and control this camera or. Just reaching to them. So it is the static I here is something that allows them to actually dial into it and most of them getting a feed off, OK, um. And then I will have enough time. I know that they charge me separately. ADT charges me separately for the alarm and then for the cameras, OK, yeah, OK."" [Agent] ""Yeah, yeah, so what I am going to do too is like I will be a single point of contact. So instead of having to call in and get bumped around or whatever, I just, I do not have a direct line I emailed you So if you need anything, even if you know, say something comes up that day, you need to reschedule, just email me and I will take care of it. Try to make everything as smooth as possible for you."" [Customer] ""OK, so does that mean there is one guy here rewiring or what are they doing? OK."" [Agent] ""Yeah, the tech is going to come work with you, make sure you are up and running."" [Customer] ""And OK, so go to the, he will go to the box. I will go to the box. I will run it in the back. In the back and they will turn it on every X hours. OK, good, I would like to be happy, so that is good."" [Agent] ""There you go. So that is it. Alright, so just, so just to recap, you are getting the $300 internet with the one static IP. $85 a month goes down to XX even once you get the uh auto pay set up. So one time installation fee of $100 rolled into the bill right now we have the tech coming Wednesday, the 23rd X to X is the window, about a half an hour before their arrival They are going to call XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Customer] ""OK, um, do I need to know anything else?"" [Agent] ""OK, do you have access, yeah, do you do you have access to your email now"" [Customer] ""OK, so that sounds good. Do you need a credit? You, you need Um, yes, I, I will get it to that."" [Agent] ""OK, because I already sent you the email, so just if you let me know you received it then I know you have my contact info"" [Customer] ""OK, sure, get into my smoking gallery. Jared. Nickels."" [Agent] ""That is me, so that is it so I."" [Customer] ""Good afternoon. It was a pleasure, OK. OK, I got it."" [Agent] ""Alright, terrific so you got that I am submitting that you are going to be good to go any other questions or anything else you need or any business accounts you have simply uh email me I will call you, OK"" [Customer] ""OK, and when do I need to give you my, yeah, and my tax ID."" [Agent] ""Yeah Email it back to me."" [Customer] ""I do not email, yeah, and what about then what do I do to set up an account when do you take the money do I have to give the guy"" [Agent] ""You do not have to do anything."" [Customer] ""What?"" [Agent] ""Everything's everything's getting billed."" [Customer] ""OK, perfect. OK, thank you."" [Agent] ""Alright, you, you have a great day."" [Customer] ""Alright sounds great."" [Agent] ""Congrats on the congrats. You have a good one. Enjoy your weekend."" [Customer] ""You too thank you so much you too bye bye."" [Agent] ""Bye bye."""

[Customer] ""OK. That is correct."" [Agent] ""OK, alright, we get everything squared away just a, a brief moment, OK? I will be right with you."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Alright. OK, thank you, Mrs. Brady. I am just checking our schedule for next week, uh, the first date that we have available, uh, is Wednesday morning, X to XX, we have Thursday between XX and X, Monday or Tuesday is not available."" [Customer] ""Oh wow, OK, well, um, I have to figure out another way to do transactions then. Oh, OK. Um Oh So what I will do I am going to put you OK, then. I am going to put you in for Wednesday morning from X to XX, right? Now if by chance there is a cancellation between now and Monday a technician is available, um, I am going to have a technician give you a call I am well I will call you back and let you know that we have Monday available, OK Yes. So right now we will put you in for Wednesday morning providing there is any cancellation, we will try to get you there on Monday, OK OK. I have a question do you have, um, do you do you do any installations on Fridays or Saturdays Yes. We have not this week Friday or Saturday but next week Friday we have available. Oh, OK, now we are going to keep it with Wednesday, um then if there is any cancellations like you said, so please call, so I will be there I will be there OK. Uh OK, good, good, good. I am there I I work all the time, so Now let me just go over the details now, let me just bring this to your attention. Just give me one moment. I want to just make sure we secure Wednesday because I did not realize how many people in your area, um. Transferring or need appointments, but um let me go ahead and adjust that for you so you are secure. I am going to send the uh request if any cancellations for you. Um, just give me one moment. Mhm. Alright and. OK. OK, now let me just take a look here. Alright, so when we transferred your account, what I had to do is this just to let you know, you do not pay the technician the transfer fee, the transfer fee you will see in your first bill, that is for $100 and that allows you to transfer or even install service. So what I did instead of having you pay that plus a month in advance, I just put everything on your bill, OK? Um, secondly, uh, what I did was I had to redo your promotion because when technically when you move you do not qualify under the same promotion. OK. And then your bill would have been a lot higher. So what I did is I requalified it. I gave you another year's time. The only difference in the bill was $5. So instead of $60.65 dollars, it is $70 you are able to, you know, have the same deal Why can not it be XX anymore? Um, let me try to see, when I try to give it. So I can not it be because I am just moving. I am just moving like a half a block. I do not understand why I can not keep the same. You Right, you are, so usually what happens is, and, and I am going to try to see if we can get that down for you, um, when you, when you move from one address to another address, the promotion rates that you have, they only apply for where you are located. It is the same service, the same company, everything. I do not understand. I understand the installation fee, but the monthly bill should be, should still be the same. It is not like I have changed anything. So when you transfer your service, a lot of times, more times than not, they will tell you they have to migrate to your standard pricing or they will migrate to the next offer. But what I am going to do is this I am going to go in there and I will access a code so we will keep it at the same price for you, OK? Appreciate that. Thank you. Alright, alright, no worries. I share with you the the new account number. The account number is indicative of your address. Let me know when you are ready. OK, well, hold on, give me just a moment, but this, so this is the old account number is, is now void, is that what you are saying? Alright, the account number goes as follows, alright. Right, the old account number is void because the old account number is linked to your old address. OK. So when we set up at the new location you need the account number that indicates your new address, alright? OK. OK. Alright, so it goes as far. Alright, I am, I am ready for the account number. You got it XXX. XX Mhm. Mhm. XXX. Mhm. XXX. Mm. XX XXXX after that? No, that is it. That is pretty much it. So it is, so it is, I am going to repeat it. Um, XXXXX XXXXXXXX Yes. Is that correct? That is correct. OK, thank you. OK, alright, so we got everything in and thank you so much and yeah we def I definitely made the adjustment we are going to keep the the rate the same that you have, OK? I appreciate that thank you very much. You, you are very welcome, Miss Brady.joy the rest of the day and thank you for choosing our own business. And you too. Goodbye. Right, right."""

[Customer] ""Is there a way before we set this up is there a way to to find out exactly what we have right now"" [Agent] ""So"" [Customer] ""And then, and then make the change?"" [Agent] ""So what what is going to happen is once, once we schedule this installation because we can literally get this installed tomorrow morning I am looking at that calendar now so once this gets installed completely under your information, your tax ID this this will be your account free and clear. You will not have any attachments to this, this other account once this is installed tomorrow, Katrina, what you can do, uh I will email you directly so you do not even have to call back in you could just shoot me an email and say, hey, Jose, technician just left Um, I am ready to work on this part that I am going to explain here. The other account that you are tied to, um, that, that needs, that is needing to be canceled because there is no reason for you to be paying two bills, right? So the other one you can just call in and say, hey, I have my own account set up."" [Customer] ""Alright."" [Agent] ""The other way I was trying to do this was not successful was causing too many issues, so I, I have my own account, um, and I need to disconnect the other one and then that is it. You just remove your billing information from that account and that is something I can assist you with."" [Customer] ""Um OK."" [Agent] ""OK, now"" [Customer] ""Uh"" [Agent] ""We, we do have other availability besides tomorrow morning. Uh, we have XX to XX to X then, you know, other availability through the week"" [Customer] ""Oh OK, and during that time when, when the technician comes, they will bring in new equipment?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, you, you are going to have your your own set up, yeah, they are they are going to bring in your own modem."" [Customer] ""Or would it be the same?"" [Agent] ""They are going to activate your own telephone line, um, and it is not going to interfere with the other service because this is strictly your account but like I said, once that is done, um, you can just email me and then we will work on getting you separated from that other account. OK."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Awesome."" [Customer] ""Um,"" [Agent] ""So let us see here, um, so yeah, did tomorrow work for you or because we have X to XXXX to X, and X to X?"" [Customer] ""OK. Yeah OK, give me just one second. Can I put you on hold for a second?"" [Agent] ""Mhm yeah absolutely."" [Customer] ""Uh, yes, so I have one question for you.

[Agent] ""And then And we, right, we can always change over for that."" [Customer] ""Yeah, oK."" [Agent] ""And what about, are you doing any streaming? Do you stream to a TV that you are playing something on YouTube, any music, anything like that?"" [Customer] ""No, but we, you know, we do Zoom a lot for office meetings and stuff, yeah, because we have a corporate headquarters out in California, so that is important you know, it is important that we are able to get into Zoom meetings and all that.""

Or will you be doing?"" [Customer] ""The overall building does so no we do not need that."" [Agent] ""OK. All right. So based on what you said to me and, you know, giving you the with the X gig and X phone lines, also, this is a high-end equipment that comes with a backup unit for fail over, OK, in scenarios, like, let us say there is an outage, right, there is a storm, um, the internet goes out in your area because there is a line cut or something like that. You are still going to have internet with this system. Uh, because it uses, it would, it would then take in a cell tower system and it will, you will still be able to continue to do business. Um, now, also, if you are doing, um. If there is an outage, and battery, and it also has a battery backup unit as well."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Um, you have expedited support uh for assistance, same day repair and remote assistance as well. Three unlimited lines, um."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And the high speed internet, modem, wireless router included, you are looking at $270 a month with a one time fee of $100."" [Customer] ""OK, is that a $270 a month, is that, uh, a price guarantee for a certain amount of time?"" [Agent] ""Yes, it is guaranteed."" [Customer] ""Or contract OK."" [Agent] ""It is not a contract. It is guaranteed, you know, because right now we are doing that because of, you know, tariffs and, you know, economy and things like that. We are locking the prices for our customers for a period of time, and in your scenario will be for X years. So you do not have to worry about, uh yeah, you do not have to worry about"" [Customer] ""Oh, for X years. So it will always be uh XXX for the X years."" [Agent] ""That is correct."" [Customer] ""Oh, that is pretty, that is pretty nice."" [Agent] ""OK. Yeah."" [Customer] ""OK, and it is a one time $100 fee."" [Agent] ""That is for the installation. We send a technician, they do the install, and yes."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Now, because you did."" [Customer] ""OK, now does that include the phones now?"" [Agent] ""This one is without the phone."" [Customer] ""What?"" [Agent] ""This one is without the phone."" [Customer] ""OK"" [Agent] ""This is just, you know, to get you going, get you started, and every, you know, later on, if you, if we do the phones, then we are looking at an additional, uh, about another $20 to get you the phones and $180 installation for those phones."" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""And that is, it, it takes us XX days from the time that we order them to the time that you actually get them installed."" [Customer] ""OK. OK, but that does not um affect my XXX price, right?"" [Agent] ""So Well, XXX plus the uh plus about."" [Customer] ""A month. Well, I mean after after I pay for each phone XX bucks or whatever phone and the XXX install my price per month with those phones in or is still going to be XXX."" [Agent] ""Well, it the. No, it is the, that, that $20 for the phones that we give you is a month it will be a monthly increase."" [Customer] ""Mm. Oh, but the XXX is an install."" [Agent] ""Yes. It is a rental equipment. Mhm, that would be that XXX is the is the in-store cost, yes, and."" [Customer] ""OK, so it is going to be $2040 so it will be about $60 more a month on that $270. Correct."" [Agent] ""No, no, it will just be about $20 more. A month Uh, uh, for your monthly, not, not, not $20 per phone, it is $60 right?"" [Customer] ""Oh, OK, so then my cost is going to be what, a month when I have those funds."" [Agent] ""So it is X XX X XX $18 so it is about $18.18 dollars to $20 for us to give you the rental equipment of of the phones. You will be, uh, I am building it up for you. It will be like uh $290 a month, $290 and then obviously there is taxes, the taxes are not, I can not tell you the taxes, but it is an estimate between $15 to $25 in taxes."" [Customer] ""Right. OK, and there is no phone rental fee is that already in there?"" [Agent] ""Yes, that, that the rental fee would be $6 per phone."" [Customer] ""OK, so that is already in that XXX kind of price, right?"" [Agent] ""Yeah. Uh yes."" [Customer] ""So I am looking about uh X something with taxes."" [Agent] ""Correct."" [Customer] ""Right?"" [Agent] ""Yes, and I have to let you know one thing right now as well."" [Customer] ""A month."" [Agent] ""If you are moving next week, uh, I highly, highly recommend for you to just kind of secure a technician for that week."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Mhm."" [Agent] ""I can help you do that. You do not have to, you know, you do not have to make any payment today , you know, if you are changing Uh, if you want to make some sort of changes or if you need to consult this with somebody else, you, you have plenty of time, but I, I only have two appointments available, uh, for the Monday the 28th, and one for Tuesday the 29th, and that is it."" [Customer] ""Twenty-eighth and the 29th. OK Um, I have a question for you as far as that guarantee for X years, so this is not a contract though, right? Like I can cancel any time? If I had to, if we are moving or something?"" [Agent] ""That, that Yeah, yeah, in that in that contract with Optimum."" [Customer] ""Yeah, OK, OK. OK, OK, alright, let me, is there a number that I should call to get you back because I have to talk to corporate or how should we handle that?"" [Agent] ""Uh Yeah Uh, well, one thing, um, this will create a, well, that is the other thing. Do you, should I secure an appointment for you for next week? Uh, like, and if we have to cancel it, we can do that?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, OK, let us do it."" [Agent] ""Because I"" [Customer] ""It would be the twenty-ninth."" [Agent] ""The twenty-ninth, yeah, because I would hate for you to call me , and need to tell you, hey, listen, I do not have anything available, right"" [Customer] ""Yeah. I understand, I understand."" [Agent] ""And then, uh, we will, we will be in trouble. So what, so let me clarify everything that I am doing for you so that there is no confusion later on. Um, I am going to secure an appointment for Tuesday, the twenty-ninth. This is an assumption that you are looking for services with Optimum. A technician will be dispatched on that day if you do not let me know. That you, you know, that you change your mind do you want a different date, you know, I am going to, you know, this is, this is an attempt for an appointment, right"" [Customer] ""Mhm. Cancel it."" [Agent] ""So if you, for whatever reason they you reach out to your, you know, whoever you need to reach out and corporate and then they say, hey, no, I, I do not want to do it, cancel this, that is fine, but you still got to let me know so that we let you we cancel it and this will stop any attempt, uh, for installation."" [Customer] ""Corporate. OK. I will."" [Agent] ""I am going to send you an email, Laura to um this way you have my contact information."" [Customer] ""Thank you. Oh good OK."" [Agent] ""And it will be directed to me so you at any time you do not have to call anymore and as a matter of fact, do not call just simply reach out to me then I will, I will, I want to have, you know, I want to help you with everything from start to finish Uh, and that is it, and that is it."" [Customer] ""What speed is that internet service?"" [Agent] ""XXXX megabytes per second, which is in other terms called the XGB."" [Customer] ""One gig, OK."" [Agent] ""OK, so, uh, what I am doing for you, you are getting the, uh, uh a backup system as a failover device in case of outages"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""You are also getting the fastest internet speed available which is the X gig"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""You are getting X unlimited phone lines you are getting our premier tech support, which gives you same-day repairs, expedited support, troubleshooting over the phone at no additional cost to you Two as of right now the cost is $270 a month then the installation fee is a one time fee of $100"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Now after Tuesday once you get installed with this. Um, you got to let me know if you want to do the, the, the, the phone system, and then I can also help you with that."" [Customer] ""OK"" [Agent] ""OK, I am going to"" [Customer] ""But that what do you mean do the phone system?"" [Agent] ""The, the, where I give you the phones, if you want to go with the rental uh with the rentals of the equipment. Remember I mentioned that we have options."" [Customer] ""XXX, OK, but for right now with this XXX or say we go along with the 29th I can plug any phone into that, right?"" [Agent] ""Yeah. Exactly, you can plug in the phone you are going to get a dial tone."" [Customer] ""OK, now. Now how will you know if I can trunk over that other phone number?"" [Agent] ""So, so once uh you have two options you can either forward the calls. Uh, how you have them working right now to one of my numbers, so the calls can just be forwarded."" [Customer] ""So like a portal, right?"" [Agent] ""But if you actually Right, so who, who said through Comcast, right?"" [Customer] ""Like a so right now Comcast and they have it through they have it ported to a different phone number. So to to."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so, so instead of uh Comcast, so Comcast owns the number. They, they have it right now, right?"" [Customer] ""Well, I do not know if they, I guess, yeah, yeah."" [Agent] ""So whoever has the number, the company has the number."" [Customer] ""But when I, we are not getting billed for the numbers that last four digits is XXXX on our bill from Comcast you we will not find the XXXX because the ported or the port or the hub or whatever number is XXXX."" [Agent] ""Hm."" [Customer] ""So I have a. I actually because this office existed in another building uh a couple of years ago that number ending in XXXX"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""They wanted to take that with them. Which they did and Comcast was able to do it but they ported it through a hub or something so you know what I mean?"" [Agent] ""Got it. OK, just call Comcast, find out where, who actually who has that number."" [Customer] ""They have it."" [Agent] ""So, so, so you have to get that account number, have it ready."" [Customer] ""They, they, they have it. Yeah."" [Agent] ""From Comcast."" [Customer] ""But will you be able to to take that number once I am able to cancel Comcast?"" [Agent] ""Oh yeah, well. Well, here is the thing."" [Customer] ""Because Comcast does not work in the area we are going that is why I am not using them."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so I, I need Comcast number to stay active. That number needs to stay active throughout the whole process that I do the port. But in order for me to port over the number, I need the account number from Comcast."" [Customer] ""Oh. Uh huh"" [Agent] ""And that number to stay active."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So the account is to be uh on."" [Customer] ""OK, oh, the Comcast account needs to stay on?"" [Agent] ""The the account needs to stay on so that I can port over the number."" [Customer] ""But then can it be closed?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, absolutely."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK, I was going to say I am not going to pay to keep an account open."" [Agent] ""Once, once, once I am able to pull over the number then that is fine. So find out that information, find out Comcast."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Um, account number?"" [Customer] ""I have that I have that information so. That should not be."" [Agent] ""OK, so I sent Right, right."" [Customer] ""I mean, I have the voice portal number. And you know, so if for in order for me to look at a voicemail I actually opened a Comcast app"" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""And I looked through the voicemails on that like it reads it right out to me."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so it was."" [Customer] ""It is called Business Voice Edge."" [Agent] ""So if for whatever reason I am not able to put over the number, what you would have to do is you have to stay with Comcast just for that one phone line. And have that number ported forward to one of my numbers which I will give you a number to forward it so that that number can receive the calls from your Comcast number."" [Customer] ""But then I would always have to have keep an account open with Comcast, right?"" [Agent] ""Correct."" [Customer] ""Mm. But then I am paying for X services."" [Agent] ""Well, you will only pay for a phone line through the, uh, with them. That is it, that you, yes, you do not have to keep the whole account open."" [Customer] ""With Comcast So keep the phone line with Comcast."" [Agent] ""You have, you can just keep that phone line, a phone line only, and you know, it will be at a At a much Just the phone line, correct."" [Customer] ""Uh, OK, but then am I going to be paying you a phone also or just Internet then?"" [Agent] ""You will pay me as well for my phone line, yes."" [Customer] ""As much, no."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so hopefully we are able to put over the number that way you do not have to do that."" [Customer] ""OK. mm."" [Agent] ""I am giving you like the worst case scenario.""

And what kind of business is this? Um, it is a, uh, like a race shop. OK, do you, do you have mobile phones for the business? Um, no, we do not. Because, uh, you have the gig speed, so if you borrow the mobile line you get a $40 discount. Uh, what do you mean rather than getting a landline, get a mobile number? You can get both. That is your choice I am just saying either one with what we do for our business customers if you bundle a mobile line, we give you a discount on your internet price I see and um well that is something that we can discuss um if you want to just tell me what the packages you have available. Sure, well, I mean if you add, if you, you can add a single line on the account that is $40 and then depending on the mobile, you know, you, you do not have to get a new phone if you have a device that is compatible, we can use an existing device you have or you can get a new iPhone or affordable phone whatever choice, but bottom line you add a line, you get the discount. OK, so that is something to consider, um. Absolutely and that you could do that even after you add this phone, so that is that is no problem at all. Thank you. Right, so I just wanted where we live in New York, it is expensive. $100 to back out of our driveway. I try to, uh, offer everyone the savings we can, you know, everything we can get.

Yeah, well, I mean, there is, I mean, you bundle on our most popular plan which is the unlimited plan. You bundle X lines it goes down to I believe $30 a lot. OK So, we may consider doing that. Excellent so what I will do is I will email you. And basically uh. If there is anything you need, I could be a single point of contact. I do not have a direct line you can email me when you guys are ready I will take care of everything All right, but as far as the landline is concerned. That part I am going to take care of right now. What is So we are going to you are only looking for one line correct Um, just one line we have a. We have a phone currently that has like uh X or X different um handsets to it. OK. But So I think we just need one, but it will rain X different locations in the building. Got you. OK, not a problem at all. Just let me get, get this, we will work on that. See if we can do uh remotely or if we need to get a tech out there depends on the equipment you have, OK. OK. All right. Alright, just give me one second here getting everything advanced now on the day of installation, is it best for the tech to call you with the XXX-X number? Sure. Uh, yeah, that'll be fine. OK, sure, sure. Alright, just another few moments just waiting for everything to provision and then we will get that installation date. OK, thank you. Alright, terrific and it looks like yeah I had to get someone there on Thursday. We have someone in the area. Um, Thursday. Actually, you know what, we are not going to be here Thursday, um, so why do not we shoot, well, the the appropriate person's not going to be here on Thursday, so why do not we shoot early next week like maybe Tuesday if possible OK. I have Tuesday. I have the yep I have Tuesday X to XXXX to X, and X to X. Um, You said Tuesday. What were the options again? X to XX? X to XXXX to XX to X. Let us do XX to X please. OK. Alright, so just to recap, you are adding the one phone line, it is $40 difference, so your new bill will be $195 even if you get signed up for the auto pay, you get $5 discount, so it will go down to $190. Alright, the texts coming on the 29th, which is Tuesday, and the XX to X is the window about half an hour before they are going to call you at XXX-XXX-XXXX. Perfect.

Miss Cole, out of curiosity, if this call were to drop for any reason, can I reach you back at the XXX-XXX-XXXX?"" [Customer] ""You sure can."" [Agent] ""Alright, Mary, my name is Rashaw once again. I will be right back."" [Customer] ""Thank you."" [Agent] ""You are welcome. Thank you so much Mr. Cole. Are you there?"" [Customer] ""Yes"" [Agent] ""So you have a couple of options here as a new customer with this new account. Would you say that, I do not know, I assume, I, I assume you are going to make a million dollars within the next X years or so right, at the new business, would you"" [Customer] ""That would be amazing."" [Agent] ""Would you say that your promo promotional offers, you know, we offer, we do not make customers sign contracts, we offer promotional deals. Promotional deals can go from anywhere between XX months then, you know, obviously once that promotion expires, rates will change accordingly we have a XX month offer, right"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And XX month offer is actually a little bit more bang for your buck you do not, because you do not have to worry That is like a X year offer no contract The difference between the two offers is literally $20 right?"" [Customer] ""OK. OK."" [Agent] ""So I will tell you the X, yeah, you know you know, again, I know when opening up a new business sometimes, you know, people want to save as much money as possible So with the value package, right, the value package, I would recommend X gig as far as your internet strength in this area um, if you were to do the value package with X TV sets And a gig um for the XX month offer you are looking at XXX. It is a XX month offer. It includes all equipment, gives you X gig on the internet. It includes the value TV. It includes two high definition boxes. It includes Wi Fi services are covered by protection and support with the Surian. It also even comes with um failover, which means that the internet should go down for any reason. You have backup of, you know, up to X hours on a backup so you are not losing business if that were to happen, that is included. And that is a X year offer."" [Customer] ""OK OK, so every month it would be that amount, either one of those, OK, I got you."" [Agent] ""If you want the X year offer, it is $363. So like I said, it is a, it is a X year, it is a $20 difference with the gig offer, but it is just a matter of, you know, it is not a contract, which means if you take a X year offer, you are not locked in and you have to stay with us for X years, but you do not have to worry about price changing and all that type of stuff for that amount of time. Right, right."" [Customer] ""Well, let us see here, um. Trying to think, so let me say, let us just say for instance if I went with the XX month, then after the two years, the price would change you said accordingly."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Do you know if it would go up or down?"" [Agent] ""Yes."" [Customer] ""Do you know how that would run?"" [Agent] ""Technically it goes up because let us just say uh and again with these promotions is basically giving the customer a certain amount off right?"" [Customer] ""Uh-huh. OK."" [Agent] ""so let us just say with the XX month offer you are getting a $200 discount for X years, right?"" [Customer] ""Mhm, OK."" [Agent] ""After X years they are not going to take the $200 away but they may say, OK, instead of us giving you a $200 discount, we will give you um a $150 discount or $175 discount which means you are looking at about a $25 jump, you know, after the two years in general. Versus you know, let us just say if you take the XX month offer, which is, you know, in the X years you end up paying more than what you could have got in the X years, right?"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Now bear in mind."" [Customer] ""Got you."" [Agent] ""You have the ability to change your account accordingly because we do have a retention team, which means even when you are in these type of deals, sometimes you can call you know, based off your business needs"" [Customer] ""Mhm OK."" [Agent] ""I no longer need this or I need more of that. How can we bundle , you know, repackage my deal You have that option the entire time as well. This is why we do not make our customers sign a contract that way we, we do not hold our customer's feet to the fire base of, uh, you know, silly contract they sign, you know what I am saying. So it is just a matter of how long do you want your promotion or how, you know, a lot of people do not want to make that phone call."" [Customer] ""Got you."" [Agent] ""They once business is going, you are going, you are going, you are going, and then one day you will look at your billing you like, wait a minute, why am I paying $30 more here or $40 more or more here and I have not changed anything, and that is typically because the promotion expired or something of that nature."" [Customer] ""Got you. OK, well, in that case, um, let us do the XX month because I like, I like that price and like you said it is only a $20 difference, so."" [Agent] ""OK. OK. No problem, and where are you guys opening up?"" [Customer] ""Where are we?"" [Agent] ""When are you opening up I said when are you opening up?"" [Customer] ""When, um, so we would like to have services started on April 30th if we could because we are going to be opening May 1st so we would like to have everything established the day before."" [Agent] ""OK. Let me take a look for you, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Mind you, there are no upfront fees or deposits required, so you know there is nothing for you to pay today or on the day of installation. Everything is billed on the back end we offer a XX day money back guarantee, OK"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Let me one second. Alright, so we have availability on we do actually have availability on Wednesday the 30th I have between X and XX or XX and X."" [Customer] ""Um, let us do, let us do the X to XX. Let us just get it knocked out in the morning."" [Agent] ""No problem. What is the best number we can call? We are on our way."" [Customer] ""Um, let me give you, uh, the cell phone, my cell phone number, uh, XXX."" [Agent] ""OK. Mhm."" [Customer] ""XXX. XXXX."" [Agent] ""XXXX out of curiosity, who did you, you know, speaking of so who is your cellular provider?"" [Customer] ""Yes. Uh, Verizon."" [Agent] ""Are you in the contract or financing your device?"" [Customer] ""Um, I, well, I do not really know. My husband has all that set up and it is a family plan, so I do not know he would be the one to tell, to tell you that."" [Agent] ""It is a family plan?"" [Customer] ""There is me and my husband and my um son and daughter-in-law are all on it."" [Agent] ""Got you. The only reason I ask, right, is because we partner with T-Mobile now where, you know, if you want to bring one of your lines over as a business mobile line right, our mobile plans start at $45 unlimited text and talk You can keep your existing device as well as your number. You do not have to sign a contract with that either if you did enroll a mobile line, you get an additional $40 off the internet price here which should drop your bill by $40 indefinitely as well The mobile plan is only $40 so it is kind of like getting a cell phone for $5 so to speak, right? Because you save on the internet and."" [Customer] ""Got you."" [Agent] ""It absorbs that if you do more than one line it is $35 per line."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So something to look at, um, that is going to be available to you at least for the foreseeable future, even if you are not ready to make a decision like that right now, um, you can go to our website optimummobile.com and take a look at those offers, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK. OK, I will talk to him about that absolutely."" [Agent] ""Alright. Not a problem, and this is an auto pay offer, alright, which means um, you know, you have to put a card on file If you do not want to do auto pay, it is $5 more which puts you at $368. Did you want to enroll in autopay?"" [Customer] ""Um, I do we are, let me see, I do not have a number I can give you off the track Can I, uh, actually, no, just set it up as normal for now. We are waiting on our new card to come in for our bank account, so just set it up as the, the other for now, yeah."" [Agent] ""OK, listen, they get, they, there is a, there is a XX day stay on it, right? So as long as you enroll, you know, on the auto pay within the 1st XX days of service, they should still honor that $5 discount, OK."" [Customer] ""OK, I do not see that being a problem."" [Agent] ""All right. Uh, not a problem. I just wanted to give you that information as well. Um, what would you like your four digit access code to be?"" [Customer] ""OK. Um, you can do, um, XXXX."" [Agent] ""OK XXXX. Alright. So you are all set. I am going to send you email confirmation to the office at owner XXXX@ office. owner at XXXX."" [Customer] ""I know you are good.""

Once again, your monthly rate will be $368 for right now because you are not enrolled in autopay. reoccurring taxes with that of $16.47."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So one time installation fee, which is $100 which is billed to you. There is nothing for you to pay today or to the technician. Everything is billed on the back end. This is a XX month offer, right? It is not a contract. You do have the freedom to upgrade and downgrade as you see fit. There are no penalties associated with that. Um, your services includes the TV, X cable boxes, high definition, includes, um, X gig internet. Services are protected with a, um, by sharing on if you ever need additional, um, tech support. It is kind of like having geek squad in your back pocket. That is including your offer."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Um, failover is also included in your offer as well, which means if for whatever reason the internet should go down versus you having to call us and see when it comes back up, the failover device will kick in, gives you an additional up to X hours worth of backup internet so, you know, you are still able to function accordingly. OK, um, we will be out to you on the 30th between X and XX we will call XX minutes in advance at the XXX-XXX-XXXX"" [Customer] ""OK. Perfect."" [Agent] ""Alright, if you want I can provide you with the account number too, which would be XXXXX."" [Customer] ""That'd be great."" [Agent] ""XXX-XXX XX."" [Customer] ""So it is XXX-XX-XXXXXX-XX.""

How can I help you?"" [Customer] ""OK. Um, yeah, so I was just, um, so we have done some, um, extensions on our building here at our. Our building, um, and so now the WiFi no longer reaches like to the back of the building."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Um, we have got some security cameras in the back that, um, can not catch the Wi Fi signal."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""So, um. I do not know the guy said that there is not like extenders um I, we need something to kind of like Get the internet through the whole building."" [Agent] ""Right, you got to increase, you know, we would have to increase the bandwidth, um, to be able to, you know, to be able to support those cameras."" [Customer] ""If that makes sense. Mhm."" [Agent] ""How many cameras are we talking?"" [Customer] ""Um, so the other cameras are already on, they work just fine. It is just that this this camera is out of range So it is not that there is like, it is like bandwidth issue, it is just, it is a range issue."" [Agent] ""Got it."" [Customer] ""Um, so it is just one camera that is out of range right now."" [Agent] ""Well yeah I mean that is a bandwidth issue that means there is not enough bandwidth to support the distance of the camera."" [Customer] ""But Uh, about, about double, yeah, we, we doubled the building."" [Agent] ""I just wanted to see if there was more than one camera just to make sure, but um when you extended it, how, how far, you know, how much did you extend it? Like is it 20%, 30%, 50%? About double."" [Customer] ""So, yeah. And so right now, um, the internet, the router and everything is in the very front of the building."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Um, in a couple of months, we are going to move it to like the middle of the building until then, um, yeah, we just, the, yeah, we just need more, more internet"" [Agent] ""Well yeah that is true. Either way you have a larger, you have a larger area so you are going to need more internet so let me just place you on a brief hold."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""You know what, let me get a good contact number for you, um, just in case."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So let me just place you on hold and see what we can do to upgrade you here on this side."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Alright, now, and what is the, um, just let me know what is the best contact number for you. I am just going to place you on a quick hold."" [Customer] ""Um OK, it is going to be my cell phone. It is uh XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Beautiful, so it is XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Customer] ""Correct."" [Agent] ""And you know what, if you do not mind, let me get a good email for you just in case."" [Customer] ""OK, yeah, it is uh Margaret Holguin X, so M A R G A R E T O L G I N as in Nancy, and then the number X at Gmail."" [Agent] ""Perfect. at gmail.com. OK, so just bear with me a few seconds, um, Margaret, I appreciate you explaining the situation is basically an expansion. So let me just, um, get everything set up for you and I will be right back."" [Customer] ""OK, thanks."" [Agent] ""Thanks. OK, now Ms."" [Customer] ""I Yeah, sure."" [Agent] ""Margaret, I wanted to ask you a couple questions if that is OK. Awesome thank you yeah I am looking on the side and I see that you had a number of different coding here with regard to different speeds here and it looks like um they did try to assist you here in the past um my thing here is how many devices would you say all together like computers, um, cameras, uh, devices that, um, personal devices, you know, in the form of cell phones or tablets, how many devices are on this network altogether would you say?"" [Customer] ""Um, Like once we are, once we are, once we are fully expanded, um, let us see, uh, XXXXXXX."" [Agent] ""Just like a gift too."" [Customer] ""Probably like XX"" [Agent] ""OK, like XX, yeah, because the way I see here with an expansion is usually adds more devices and what you are describing now, if you know it is not getting back to the camera, that means that whatever services you had before were not sufficient because well you, you know, you did extend it and you just added, you know, a a camera, not really added a camera, but you know it should be able to extend beyond that so that just means there is not enough coverage there. So I am going to be able to upgrade you significantly because the speed that I see here, um, you know, looks like uh like I said you had uh some kind of mixture here we do not even carry the speed anymore so we are, we are going to be able to upgrade you, uh, and modernize your situation so even when you do expand you add anything more you will not need to make any additions after after this So just bear with me a few seconds and I just want to um see if I have the approval to move forward with this package I will just confirm everything with you in a little bit"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Now, as far as everything else goes, um, with the extension of the building, do you have like a break room or something, um, or, or for guests or clients or anything like that where you, where you have like TVs or anything set up?"" [Customer] ""Well, we are at a daycare, so every classroom has a TV, um, we will have a security system, um, that has its own like TV screen, um."" [Agent] ""OK, like a smart board something type deal?"" [Customer] ""And then Um, it is um, I am not really sure. We are still, we are, we are still trying to get that set up, the, the security system, but, um, but yeah, we will, we have like XX classrooms."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Each classroom will have like a smart TV in it. Um, each classroom has its own tablet. We have sign-in tablets um, there is the com the office computers, um, and then all of our personal cell phones, um"" [Agent] ""OK, OK, yes."" [Customer] ""Yeah, so it is, there is, yeah, quite a few."" [Agent] ""Yeah, I mean it just makes sense, yeah, that there is a number of and I do, I did see that, you know, it says little red wagon children, so I figured that um in my past life I was in education but I was in a a secondary yet so I know that you do have a combination of resources and stuff."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Right."" [Agent] ""So when I said TV I kind of meant like, um, like cable, uh, because I do not see that on the account but I know that there is the educational format so that would not be there."" [Customer] ""Oh no, yeah."" [Agent] ""I just have to ask because we are a telecommunications company."" [Customer] ""Right. Oh yeah, no, no, no cable."" [Agent] ""OK Perfect, perfect."" [Customer] ""We, we just do through the smart TVs, you know we can do some of the educational programs, so, yeah"" [Agent] ""Now also I wanted to ask this, um, is there any like Wi Fi sharing like do you have any guests or or like parents or anything that they are on the network because that again that is usually not the case in an educational settings usually very uh private and obviously restricted just again wanted to confirm so I have everything I need"" [Customer] ""No. Mm mm. Yeah."" [Agent] ""I am just going to like I said, just getting approval to see when we can get out to you I will just review and confirm the pricing in just a few moments"" [Customer] ""OK, perfect."" [Agent] ""Thank you. OK, so we are almost there, um, Miss Margaret, I wanted to ask you, are you on site at this location um, daily because I just want to see if you are going to be available for the installation"" [Customer] ""Check it out. Yes, let go of her. Yes, yeah, Monday through Friday."" [Agent] ""OK, got it. So I am just like I said I am just going to finish up and see you, you know, definitely doing a little referee thing, so I will be right back Let me get out of here here."" [Customer] ""OK, no worries, thank you."" [Agent] ""Thank you. OK, Ms. Marcus, so I was able to complete everything again I apologize for the delay here Um, what we are able to do is we are able to upgrade your internet. Um, you are going to be getting a new gateway a new router, a new modem Uh, because you have extended, uh you will possibly be adding devices in the future, we just want to get, just take the Wi Fi as a bubble And when you get outside of the bubble, things get a little shaky and things do not work. So what we want to do is we want to make a massive bubble, you know, kind of like a, a barrier protection. So keep all the kids inside, everybody's happy every, you know everybody's covered"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So what this is going to do is this is going to take you, which was odd you had um"" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""Some kind of supplement here you are going to be going, uh, we are going to give you XX times uh what you currently had so this is going to be the X gig This one gig uh promo is going to come with a gateway a router, a motor combo So what is going to happen is the tech's going to come in, um, they are just going to, uh, swap out um the older technology, replace it with some newer technology, and upgrade everything there, and that is uh going to include the gateway, the router, the modem. It is also going to have a fail over, um, and what that is going to do is that is going to protect against any interruption. So if there is any outages that you know, a telephone wire goes down, it is very windy or something, even if there is uh like I said, an interruption in the service, it will immediately go to the fail over so you will be able to maintain your Internet, um, as well. Now this also is going to come with our uh premier protection and support, so it is going to support all the devices that you have, even your cameras, any uh screens, any uh TVs, and is also uh assist you with replacement. So, uh, if something were to go down, if something, you know, were to, uh, were to break and it needed to be replaced, you can contact us we would be only we would be able to support you in XX seconds or less and also, uh, assist with the replacement of any devices so you do not would not have to go through that as well. Um, what I was able to do here is, uh, get you this promotion. It is in you would be at $300.20 monthly with everything that you already have on there, uh, including this internet upgrade. It is an increase of about $125. There is an install uh fee associated with that of $100 but I was able to go ahead and waive that, um, you know, based on obviously working with you and this just being like a daycare center. So, um, I was able to waive that for you."" [Customer] ""No, thank you."" [Agent] ""Yeah, you are very welcome. And you said you are going to be on site. I just was not certain, uh, because it is a daycare center when you um wanted to have services installed um, I do still have dates for this week"" [Customer] ""Mhm Mhm."" [Agent] ""I, I actually even have today, um because you have, you know, the kiddos there, I just wanted to see what day works for you"" [Customer] ""Yeah, um, I think any, any day, um, if I assume he has to, like, you know, like disconnect everything and then reconnect everything, um, so the only, the only caveat is that if, if that can not be during that time, um, just because we have lullabies going on and."" [Agent] ""Well, the only thing is I was going to say. OK, so when are the lullabies going on?"" [Customer] ""Um, between XX and X."" [Agent] ""OK, between XX and X. OK, so let me see. What I have because we either have all right you know what, maybe I can get you into an X to XX. Let me see if that is feasible just bear with me a few moments here."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Let me see here. Now I also wanted to ask you this here um do you have a fax line there how many phone lines do you have there"" [Customer] ""No, we, we just have the one, yeah, we, we have had fax before, but we, we do not really have a use for it, um, and the one, the one phone line is fine."" [Agent] ""OK, because I do see one phone line I just wanted to make sure."" [Customer] ""Yeah, no, that is, that is good."" [Agent] ""OK, alright, cool, cool, just wanted to make sure."" [Customer] ""But speaking, speaking of, speaking of the phone, is there anything that we can do about the amount of like spam calls that we get? Cause I swear it is like every other call is Like some robot or some You know, some, some spam."" [Agent] ""OK, well, let me look into that we may have because I know, um, usually in your area, you know, just being transparent, there is like an uptick and it is usually at a certain part of the year. I do not know if they have like some type of campaign going, but the way you are describing that, that is really annoying."" [Customer] ""Yeah, it is, yeah, especially when I am running across the building to try to answer the phone and then it is nobody, so."" [Agent] ""Um OK, yeah, definitely can not have that. So let me see if we can add a protection on there or just the way to troubleshoot. I may have to email you later on on that, but let me get you an X to XX slot for the lullabies then I will, I will look into the other thing"" [Customer] ""That is, that is fine. That is. OK perfect. OK."" [Agent] ""Thanks. OK, so I actually have, you know, I actually have, uh, Thursday X to XX I have tomorrow."" [Customer] ""Tomorrow X to XX. I think, yeah, I think that is good. I think that will work."" [Agent] ""OK awesome so this is going to be because I still have your contact number here alright so your contact number is XXX-XXX-XXXX?"" [Customer] ""Yes, sir.""

There is an increase of $125 even. Everything will go on a prorated bill you can continue to pay as you have been doing in the past Um, what is going to happen here as I said, the tech is going to give you a call XX minutes prior and you know, set everything up so they could be in and out, uh, before lullabies and all that."" [Customer] ""OK. Perfect. OK perfect."" [Agent] ""Alright, so other than."" [Customer] ""And that is Thursday, tomorrow, Thursday?""

[Agent] ""No problem. Let us see here."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Alright, so I am just going to get some general information. So what is going to be the name of your business?"" [Customer] ""Hm?"" [Agent] ""What is going to be the name of your business?"" [Customer] ""Authentic city. The authentic city, the authentic city, the food, um, the Caribbean experience."" [Agent] ""Authentic City? Thank you. And how many devices do you think you might have set up on your network for the restaurant as far as like let us say uh security cameras, credit card processors, tablets, maybe stuff like that?"" [Customer] ""Mhm. Yeah. Yeah, cameras for sure. Um, The Kia machine thing for the, the register."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Yes, and um,"" [Agent] ""Do you think you might have XX or more devices in total?"" [Customer] ""Maybe, maybe even less, maybe like XX, so."" [Agent] ""OK, and do you plan on letting your guests use the. Internet service as well when they come in?"" [Customer] ""Mm. I am not sure about that."" [Agent] ""Got you. Because the reason why I am asking just trying to once again see what package is going to suit you the best what we are going to put together for you and next question is about phone service"" [Customer] ""Mhm. Mhm."" [Agent] ""So how many phone lines do you think you need for the location because you know sometimes it is just."" [Customer] ""Just one, just one."" [Agent] ""And let us say does that include possibly a security system, a fire alarm because sometimes a fire alarm has to has to have a dedicated phone line."" [Customer] ""Fire alarm system."" [Agent] ""Correct, typically those are dedicated phone lines, meaning that is not a phone line you can make incoming and outgoing calls from."" [Customer] ""Oh. So what, so what you, so what do you do that line to do?"" [Agent] ""It is just connected to the fire alarm. So for example, let us say if you have to have a fire alarm set up with a phone line any time someone calls in a restaurant to make a reservation or just to place an order, it is going to trip the fire alarm because that is supposed to be a line that is never used until the fire alarm goes off then automatically will ring the fire department."" [Customer] ""Um"" [Agent] ""So those lines have to be like a dedicated line."" [Customer] ""Um, Oh OK. OK, so for Like, um, so, so if somebody calling the restaurant, right?"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""You said I am not getting it."" [Agent] ""So if you have one line and it is connected to the fire alarm and you are making phone calls from it, it is going to constantly trip the fire alarm of the alarm system."" [Customer] ""Yes OK, so you are going to need X lines now, so definitely need X lines."" [Agent] ""Yeah, because typically that is a dedicated line. So if you go to some restaurants, they will have like if they have an alarm system or a fire alarm where they have to because they have a certain amount of people, you know, per location that you can fit when you have a certain amount, then you have to have a dedicated line for the fire department"" [Customer] ""OK. OK."" [Agent] ""So if someone calls that line, it is going to make the fire department think there is an emergency."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Right, so that line can like never be used."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""It is only dedicated to the fire department well, the alarm system slash fire department"" [Customer] ""No. My alarm system slash for the department. OK, so and you, sorry, excuse. So on that line it it cover for So basically you get that with everything underneath the bundle you just like that would be a bundle, right?"" [Agent] ""Well, the promotion automatically comes with one phone line."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So if you want to add a 2nd, a 3rd, or 4th, XX phone lines, we can add additional phone lines as you need. So I am going to like, let us say pencil you right now for X lines, X line for the business and one line for the alarm system."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""And let us see here and I am sorry what is your name again"" [Customer] ""Diesel."" [Agent] ""I am sorry, can you say that again?"" [Customer] ""Basil."" [Agent] ""Basil"" [Customer] ""B Z"" [Agent] ""Basil."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""And can you spell that for me? I just want to make sure I am pronouncing it correctly."" [Customer] ""B A S I L."" [Agent] ""Thank you."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""OK, let us see here. So once again we have speeds up to one gig available in the area one gig being our top speed"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So with the two phone lines. Your monthly rate would be XXX."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""It would be a X year promotion, no contracts, of course, with us here at Optimum, a one time install fee of $100 and that would be on the first bill."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Earlier I had asked you if you possibly needed."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Uh, if you were going to let your customers use the Internet service, you said no, correct?"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""OK, because we do offer something called a pro Wi Fi access point to where if you do let your customers use your internet, it is not pulling directly from your network."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""It will be like its own separate hub that they can use plus it is kind of a way of free advertising as well because you can also market to these customers who use your access point."" [Customer] ""OK So OK. Oh, OK."" [Agent] ""So we do offer something like that as well for 39.95% if you might be interested in having additional internet coverage for your customers and also other ways to advertise to them."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And that would be the price with our X gig speed tier. And once again that is with the X phone lines and a X year promotion."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK."" [Agent] ""No contracts with us here at Optum. When were you looking to have this set up by?"" [Customer] ""Uh, that would be What that that would be?"" [Agent] ""I am sorry, say that again."" [Customer] ""A month. How much that would be you said XXX?"" [Agent] ""Correct."" [Customer] ""Mm. Alright, so we get that. I am going to run this by my partner, that is my wife, whatever, because when she is in business, get it, so I am going to run it by her and let you know then we can get back"" [Agent] ""No problem. Were you looking for something different?"" [Customer] ""See you No, no, no, no, not, not really, just that I, I just want to make sure the gig, as you said is X gigabyte you guys, that is the high speed you guys offer."" [Agent] ""Were you looking for something else, if you do not mind me asking? What concerns do you currently have? Correct."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I am calling from. That is the highest speed so there is nothing, there is nothing more you guys could offer because I think the"" [Agent] ""But you would not need nothing more than that. Like one gig is the fastest pretty much in the country almost right now, but you would not need anything more than that."" [Customer] ""I know Yeah. Yeah, exactly, so that is what I am saying."" [Agent] ""With the amount of devices that you are telling me and that is the, that is your download speed that is not how much data you can use a month. It is not like a cell phone plan, so it is not like you get capped at one gate."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Yeah."" [Agent] ""That is your speed download if you were guys were looking for possibly something for less money, where you are looking for something to be a little bit less for your monthly bill?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, oK."" [Agent] ""like what concerns do you have?"" [Customer] ""Well, you, you, you got something you got something left to offer where you think would be good"" [Agent] ""Well, that is why. That is what I was to let you know that is our fastest speed so we do have other speeds that are under the X gig as well so we do have a XXX."" [Customer] ""So what is what is that?"" [Agent] ""We have a XXX meg internet speed."" [Customer] ""XXX. Mhm."" [Agent] ""And that is half the speed of the X gig, so let us see what that one would be for you."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Give me X 2nd here."" [Customer] ""So but what do you think about that, the, the, the XXX megabyte is um I think XXX megabytes maybe could carry that because it is just like you are not, we just carry a camera. And maybe um have a smart TV. And a and a and a uh maybe uh you say a tablet or a computer. So a laptop, so it is that is supposed to be good. With the with the with the register too so you know most of these registers nowadays they use the internet stuff."" [Agent] ""No I hear you. So most businesses, especially restaurants, do use the one gig speed because eventually they let the customers use the internet service because a lot of customers ask, you know, over time, can we log on to your Wi Fi and stuff like that."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Mm."" [Agent] ""So as the business grows and you find you need to use different aspects of it."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""The X gig does come in handy because after a few months customers do start asking can we use your Wi Fi?"" [Customer] ""Mhm Mm Mhm."" [Agent] ""can we use your Wi Fi? And a lot of restaurants at first who do start out with like the X gig, I am sorry, the XXX will upgrade to the X gig. Why? Because the customers have to use the internet."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""They are sitting there for eating for like X hour, X hours, they are going to want the coverage that is an option. So let us see what the XXX speed. Monthly rate would be XXX. Also a X year promotion."" [Customer] ""1:30 1:30 with the extra with the extra line right with the extra phone line."" [Agent] ""With the two phone lines, correct."" [Customer] ""Yeah, but it is all online and um. And um and the, the next thing would you call it, um, basically, that is it."" [Agent] ""Well, I am sorry, say that part again."" [Customer] ""Mm. No, I was thinking about the, the, the, the, the next thing that you said. Well, I will explain what you said that I said that that do not necessarily."" [Agent] ""Got you."" [Customer] ""Alright, so XXX XX megabytes with the two phone lines and um."" [Agent] ""Correct. And you can always once again upgrade to the one gig if you need it."" [Customer] ""There is the XX line on it."" [Agent] ""That is not something you have to start out with."" [Customer] ""And I can always, and and that is something I have to start out with."" [Agent] ""Correct."" [Customer] ""OK, so you use your suggestion is that, so go with the one, go with the XXX and just go, yeah, alright, so I am going to tell her then I can get back to you guys"" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Uh, if anything you guys can give me a call back you can give me a call back we can and see, understand"" [Agent] ""Understood anything that would be holding you back today?"" [Customer] ""No, no, no, nothing with that. It is just that I want to run it by her and get so both of us can agree and."" [Agent] ""Do you think you would have an issue with it?"" [Customer] ""Mm"" [Agent] ""You think she would have an issue with it?"" [Customer] ""I do not know because she was trying to Verizon. She was, she was going to try Verizon I told her, why would you try I said, listen. Verizon is not the, not the um Not the Well I mean is that a good service where they can um give you a good price and then bumpers and stuff like that, you understand.

Call88,"[Agent] ""Thank you for calling Optimum Business sales in new home of Optimum Mobile. This is Alex. How can I help your business today?"" [Customer] ""Hi, Alex, um, I have a current account with you guys. The, uh, cable guy came out, uh, I do not know, a week or so ago , uh, we are supposed to be having, um, a couple of cable boxes and internet put in He did install the internet, but there were no cable lines for cable boxes, and he was like, I do not do that."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""You got to get an electrician out here. Um, so I have now had an electrician come out I need to get the rest of the things set up And I would also like to look at adding in a landline as well. So. Uh, that is, that is where I am at."" [Agent] ""OK, let us see what is going on there and uh was that like a wall fish?"" [Customer] ""Uh, uh, a what, ma'am? I am sorry?"" [Agent] ""That the technician said that he could not do."" [Customer] ""Uh, I mean, there were no lines at all, um, other than the, the one existing line that the internet was already in, uh there were no other lines for televisions So, uh,"" [Agent] ""Got you."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""And what is your address? May I have your address please for the services?"" [Customer] ""Sure, it is uh XXXX South Austin Avenue in Georgetown, Texas, XXXXX. OK good."" [Agent] ""Altaloma?"" [Customer] ""That is correct Al Saloma, yes ma'am. You see a telephone line anywhere? Yeah, I do not think we are going to be able to do that. Because I did not think to have the electrician do it, so. Yeah, and we can do it later though, so. I yeah."" [Agent] ""OK, and how many cable boxes do you need, sir?"" [Customer] ""Two cable boxes then."" [Agent] ""And any particular channels or package that you are looking for?"" [Customer] ""Um, I had it set up on there previously, I guess they took it off quarter , um, basically I would like everything except for HBO and Showtime and all that jazz"" [Agent] ""OK. So all the channels, but the premium channels."" [Customer] ""Yes ma'am. Yeah"" [Agent] ""So the phone line you possibly could get it added um because our phone services is it is a voice over IP so it works over the internet so he should have hooked you up well I do not know if you had it originally on the original order the modem could be shared"" [Customer] ""Oh, is it? OK. I, I did not, so. OK, I did not have it on the original order, so yeah, if it is, uh, that was going to be my question because as I am here at this property looking around, I do not see any telephone jacks either, and I was like, oh Jesus, this does not work but um yeah, if it is a voice over IP then yes that would be great."" [Agent] ""OK, so I am going to give you a quote for the cable and the phone service and then um there is going to be a one time set up fee for $100."" [Customer] ""OK. Um, I"" [Agent] ""Bill to next month's bill."" [Customer] ""I guess it is fine. I mean, I, I literally had to pay the setup fee for him to come out and literally install a modem for X minutes, and, and then he tell me he could not do anything else like that just, sure, that is fine, whatever. Um."" [Agent] ""Let me see if I could waive it for you. Well, I am working on this just to let you know you could save $40 off your internet bill if you bundle with Optum Mobile. We do offer cell phone services for businesses now. Do you have a cell phone provider currently?"" [Customer] ""I do, ma'am, and I will be honest with you, I, I have talked with someone about that in the past, but I have almost XXX lines on a cell phone, uh, plan right now for the business."" [Agent] ""Wow."" [Customer] ""And to be brutally honest with you, why, I like that idea, it would just be such a beast, um, and I, I just do not have the mental capacity for that right now, so I am going to be brutally honest with you."" [Agent] ""I understand sir."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""And then um we do offer a new product that is called the connection backup we do offer a free install for it um right now at the moment it is a $100 set up as well for it and what it does is it connects to the nearest cell phone tower when your internet goes down due to an outage or any technical issues. Is that something I could interest you in today?"" [Customer] ""I, I Not today. And the reason why is, is, um, most of our systems that we use require static IP, and I have been explaining that that would not let me keep the static IP."" [Agent] ""Mm."" [Customer] ""So, um, it, it, uh, well it is an awesome idea, it just does not help with what we have going on here, yeah."" [Agent] ""No. Absolutely. So if we were to add one phone line and two cable boxes with the preferred video package, you are looking at total monthly costs for XXX. Well that is with the internet so the whole bundle package and uh I am I am leaving the install fee for you"" [Customer] ""OK, I appreciate that, ma'am, um."" [Agent] ""Uh"" [Customer] ""OK, that is, that is understandable."" [Agent] ""Alright, and let me see when is my first available to get your service installed.

Alright, so we have you scheduled for Monday the 28th between X and XX. We are installing one phone line with two cable boxes and the premier package. Uh, new total monthly rate with the Internet is at XXX with a free install."" [Customer] ""Thank you, um, and one question, do I just get any specific kind of phone for, for the, the voice over IP or does that come with one or what do I do there?"" [Agent] ""So it is, it is not a business hosted voice, it is voice over IP meaning it just works over the internet you can bring any device of yours that can also be used as a fax line or for security purposes."" [Customer] ""But Right. OK, cool. No, I will, I will, uh I will just pick one up I appreciate that. Give me one.""

It includes unlimited calling all XX states, Canada and Puerto Rico, caller ID, call waiting, call waiting ID, X way calling, call forwarding and voicemail. Wi Fi is also included. Services are covered with assuring and protection and support as well as backup fail over the internet should go down you still have backup up to X hours so that you do not lose any business Once again, that rate would be XXX."" [Customer] ""OK, could you tell me the price if we dropped it down to XXX we definitely are not going to be on auto pay It is, um, it is going to be, uh, just old fashioned paper billing."" [Agent] ""No problem, give me one second."" [Customer] ""If you were to go to fiber, it is $20 if you go to $500 it is $20 less. Yeah, let us go ahead and keep it at XXX then. OK, bear with me one moment. We, we, we in, in the future, but right now I am just trying to get, you know, uh, uh, you know. Get it in and get established it. Now here is the thing, but you can upgrade and downgrade as you said see fit, obviously, right? You just Mhm. But I always like to give customers little nuggets that they can utilize, you know, when doing it, so you know how to do it. Um, typically right now what you are doing is getting an acquisition offer, which means your best deal that you are going to get is when you sign up. Sure. So But And although you do have the ability to upgrade and downgrade, it is not going to be an upgrade at the promotion price. So let us just say you call me a month from now or call us a month or two from now and say, you know what, I need to bump it up to a gig. It may not be a $20 upcharge. It may be like a $35 upcharge because it is an upgrade at that point. Right, I, I get it, yeah, we will just keep it at the XXX. OK. No problem, bear with me one second. I am going to take a look at availability for you as well, OK? You said you are not looking to do auto pay, right? We are not, no. Alright, give me one moment. Sure. It is official. Foreign aid has been. Mhm. It will just take one moment, OK? You guys use mobile phone for your business? We do not No? OK. Yeah, pretty much all of our houses are set up with the same basic services, uh, you know, internet and business fund, that is it. Mhm OK, do you set up a lot of like a lot of these homes? We have, um, across the country, we have about XXXX. So, um, here in Rockland County, New York, those are, those are mine um so we are looking to add one every, every quarter, so OK. If you are, I mean, do you like, it would, it would make it so much easier in the future if I could just deal with one person if you kind of get what we do. I was going to suggest that, yeah, so what I will do, you know, once I get the date for you, what I will do is I will send you an email you can email me directly when you need to set these things up that way you do not have to make this phone call Yeah, oh, and, and then I would. Yeah. We can, you know, just let me know the address. Yeah Right. I will reach out to you and tell you what deals are available, so forth and so on. Makes it a little bit, you know, easier process for you, but I absolutely can do that for you. So I will do my personal or well my business email address if you want that I will, I will, I will give it to you right now. Alright, well, give me one second, let me try to get this data. I am going to place you on a brief hold, um, while I try to see what you know the availability is should this call drop for any reason am I able to reach you back at the XXX-XXX-XXXX Yeah, so You are. Alright, give me one second, Jason. I will be right back, OK? All right, yup. Thank you so much for your patience. OK, so I have availability and you said you, you need it around the first. You sure you do not want to get something in there before that to ensure you have service by the first, or you want to install it after the first? Well, our, our lease does not does not start in so I can not even get in there. I, I mean I may be able to speak with the landlord to. You know, I am, I am just not sure how willing until he gets the first check which, you know, I, I have got, we, we have some items we have to have rectified before I hand that check over. Mhm. I just do not know how willing he is to, to get us in there. Makes sense? I would say the first would be a good let us stick to that. OK, so we do have the first available. I have between X and XX or XX and X of that day. Uh, let us do XX and X. XX and X alright. Uh, can I use the number that you gave me the best number to reach out to when when the tech is on his way? Absolutely. Uh, what would you like your X digit access code to be? Uh, XXXX. Alright Alright, so I will actually get the rate down to $140 for you. The taxes would be $4.87. Um, there are no upfront payments or deposits. Everything is billed on the back end. We offer a XX day money back guarantee, alright? Um, this is not a contract, it is a XX month fixed rate. So again, should you need to make changes, cancel, and different there are no penalties to do so All equipment is included with the offer. We are going with the XXX fiber, which is equal upload and download. Services include protection and support through Asurion.

Call91,"[Agent] ""Thank you for choosing Optimon Business. Now offering Altima Mobile. This is Lizzie. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking to?"" [Customer] ""Hi, my name is Moshera. Um, I am not sure if I, uh, I have the business extension, the home extension. I just want to install, I do not know how it is called, but Verizon's called File Services, like wired internet. Um, I, I am a, it is uh on a LLC like the name of the account is LLC, so you have to press the business extension or the home."" [Agent] ""So if you are wanting to put it under a business name it would be with the business extension. What is the address?"" [Customer] ""OK, so it is XXX,XXX. North 6th Street, Newark, New Jersey. Um, And zip code, I got to check out the zip code. I am not actually sure what the zip code is."" [Agent] ""You said that was XXX North 6th Street?"" [Customer] ""No, XXX."" [Agent] ""So XXX North."" [Customer] ""XXX North. Yeah."" [Agent] ""Now when I Google search this XXX North 6th Street nothing's pulling up for me"" [Customer] ""Newark, New Jersey, XXX Newark, New Jersey."" [Agent] ""XXX North New Jersey."" [Customer] ""I think it is XXXX, check it out. XXXXX. Newark, New Jersey."" [Agent] ""OK, give me the full address one more time."" [Customer] ""XXX North Sex Street, Newark, New Jersey XXXXX."" [Agent] ""So not Connecticut?"" [Customer] ""No, I am in Newark, New Jersey, I said."" [Agent] ""Are you saying North N O R T H or Norwalk?"" [Customer] ""North, north. Like south, north."" [Agent] ""Now is this a house?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, this is the house. It is my office."" [Agent] ""OK, when you Google search it, it is a big white, like X story white house."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""And what floor are you going to be on?"" [Customer] ""So I am on the first floor the back door entrance is my office"" [Agent] ""OK OK, so it looks like we are servicing the 2nd floor, so we should not have any issues servicing your location and then it looks like we have got speeds as fast as the X gig you said this is for your office?"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""How many devices would you think you are you?"" [Customer] ""I am just, I am using your."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""I am using over there, let us say one computer that I am using. I think there is using one computer then I have another computer just for monitoring cameras Uh, and I have a camera system that is running on the internet over there."" [Agent] ""OK, so X computers and a camera set up?"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Mm mhm."" [Customer] ""I like X cameras."" [Agent] ""OK, so quite a few devices let us see. Are you needing any phone lines for like emergencies or elevators?"" [Customer] ""No, no, I just need internet."" [Agent] ""Well, it looks like right now we do have a we do have a special running with our X gig internet where we can offer a X year price guarantee"" [Customer] ""Just I."" [Agent] ""It does not include a contract. This this also includes your internet as well as what is called the connection back up. So if your internet ever stops working, this would automat."" [Customer] ""What is connection back up?"" [Agent] ""So if your internet ever"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, keep on."" [Agent] ""So if your internet ever stops working, it would automatically turn on to continue to support your internet services so you would never see any type of like internet outages or your internet would never be down and right now it looks like we can offer that at just $140 with a discount for auto pay and paperless billing."" [Customer] ""No, no, no. I am looking, I think that the $50 plan that I could get for, it is a $60 plan that usually you can get it for $50. I think that should work for me. And if it will not work, I think I will upgrade myself afterwards cause first I want to test that cause most probably, I do not need more than this."" [Agent] ""So now I mean with the amount of devices that you have you will end up having to upgrade in the future and getting our slowest speed we can offer you new customer pricing in the end you are going to end up paying more whenever you upgrade so I would probably recommend starting with a faster speed We do have our XXX meg Internet right now that we can just offer at $90."" [Customer] ""So how, so what is the $60 plan?"" [Agent] ""The $60 plan is our base plan. It is only XXX megabytes per second."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK, you know what, I think I will make a bit more research how much gig of data, what speed I need then I will take a time because I do not want to pay XXX a month XX is also quite expensive for me so I think I will give uh Google the I will make some research and uh XXX megabytes per second, if it is enough for me."" [Agent] ""OK, well I mean we can get you set up with the XXX megabytes per second."" [Customer] ""Cause that is the base where I want to go and if it will not be enough, I will take the XX. I know, but you, you are saying that that if I do need the XX, it pays to take it in the beginning because I got the new new customer discounts so that is why I want to make some research first."" [Agent] ""So it definitely does. Do you not know the type of like cameras that you are using there?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah. I, I know it is cameras. It is like uh MVR system. It is uh X cameras over there."" [Agent] ""So you just have, you said in in."" [Customer] ""Like, what do you mean which type of cameras? You can ask me a question I can answer you"" [Agent] ""OK, what is the brand of cameras that you are using?"" [Customer] ""Grilling R E L O N I K"" [Agent] ""Cause all you are really needing is to know what your upload speed is, what you are needing for an upload speed. And it looks like the relo cameras. You said you have got multiple cameras?"" [Customer] ""I have X cameras over there on the XX megapixel."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so it looks like with that one you would need a higher one. You are going to be looking at like a XX."" [Customer] ""OK, I will tell you, I have, I have like X, I have like X locations that I am using this NVR with X cameras or more."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Um, but I am over there, I am just using the cameras I think I am only using a XXX, I do not know, the base plan of Verizon, the files"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""So I think that is uh also XXX megabytes per second and uh. And it works very good, so."" [Agent] ""OK, then let us get you set up with the XXX megabytes per second."" [Customer] ""The cameras by itself. So that is what I am saying. I think I will do some research before. You know what? Just tell me like this. Let us say if I start with the, with the XXX megabytes per second, that is $50 a month for a new customer."" [Agent] ""So that is $60 monthly for a new customer with the discount for auto pay."" [Customer] ""How could it be because last time they told me that the base is XX and I the new customer discount is XX So maybe that is only for homeowners?"" [Agent] ""Possibly so business is different than residential, so with business, um, we know that your services are top priority because you are normally running a business with those services, so you get a better connection through business than you would through residential."" [Customer] ""Oh, so it is a better connection. What do you mean a better connection? Both of them are XXX megabytes per second."" [Agent] ""But your top priority with a business account over a residential account. So like if there is an outage we are going to."" [Customer] ""What do I gain from top priority? Like, what the, you are saying the top priority."" [Agent] ""I am sorry."" [Customer] ""What is the definition? What do you meant to say what top priority? What will I gain?"" [Agent] ""So like if there is an outage in your area for some reason we have an outage and the internet's down we are going to make sure to turn on our businesses before we turn on our residential customers."" [Customer] ""Got you. OK, so that is, OK, you know what? OK, so how I told you, thank you very much for your special help. I will do some research on the how much megabytes a second I need. Um, just one more question, um, how much is the, uh, XXX megabytes per second plan for a new customer?"" [Agent] ""So I mean we are already hitting your price point. What is stopping us from getting the account set up?"" [Customer] ""But"" [Agent] ""So we are already hitting the price point that you are looking for. What is stopping us from getting the account set up?"" [Customer] ""So, cause I want to know what I need. So that is why I got to do some research before, right?"" [Agent] ""You need it or that you have the Rioli cameras and they only need about XX megabytes per second. We are offering you at least I believe a XX with our XXX megabytes per second, so we have got you covered on that. What else are we needing to research? I am here to help you."" [Customer] ""Cause I, cause, yeah, yeah."" [Agent] ""I can help you research as much as possible."" [Customer] ""Cause I am also using two computers over there, that is why."" [Agent] ""OK, well, what if I could get you set up with our XXX meg Internet for $70 monthly?"" [Customer] ""So Instead of XX?"" [Agent] ""So our XXX instead of XX, I can do it for XX."" [Customer] ""Like uh like the Oh, so that makes sense. OK, I think I will go with this, with this one."" [Agent] ""OK, oK, so it is going to be."" [Customer] ""Yeah, this makes sense."" [Agent] ""What is the business name we are putting it in."" [Customer] ""But it, it takes for me the $10 to be sure. Yeah, thank you very much. I appreciate it. I think that should be enough. That should be fine. OK, so, so what information do you need?"" [Agent] ""What is going to be the business name we are putting it under?"" [Customer] ""So just a sec. Uh, let me check the LLC on this one. So it is M and M like M and M."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Um Manage, manage. Oh, I love C."" [Agent] ""And can you spell your first and last name for me?"" [Customer] ""Oh, that is. M O S H E My last name is S T R A S S E R."" [Agent] ""And what is your tax ID number?"" [Customer] ""My tax ID number is. I do not know. I do not get it. I do not have the information pulled up here. Um, just a second. Just a second, cause I am not in the office right now. I just texted my worker. She my secretary should check it out."" [Agent] ""OK, I have to put this address."" [Customer] ""Uh, because I changed, I changed phones. I changed, I changed phones today. So that is why I do not have all my information on me."" [Agent] ""Did you get a new mobile phone?"" [Customer] ""Oh you said you pulled up that address, yeah, a change and not a new one, just they switched around."" [Agent] ""OK, did you switch over to Optimum Mobile with us?"" [Customer] ""No, no, no. I am on T-Mobile. I am I am perfectly fine on T-Mobile."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Everything works fine. I have a yearly plan set up over there."" [Agent] ""OK, well, we are on the same network as T-Mobile and we are a lot cheaper than them. Um, T-Mobile and the ranges with packages around $90 to like $120. We have packages ranging from $15 to."" [Customer] ""Yeah, but I am not using T-Mobile direct. I am using US mobile. I am using US mobile that is the cheapest plans known to be that even if you want."" [Agent] ""How much are you paying with them?"" [Customer] ""No one can be tear. I am paying for a XX gigabyte fast speed data."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Um, unlimited talk and text, XX gigabytes roaming data, international service, a month, XXX minutes calling like not international calling, I have unlimited, but, uh, roaming, like if I am in a different country, uh, XXX minutes, XXX text messages."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""And I am paying for my whole plan through the year. I paid XXX. I, I, I do not remember or, or XXX or XXX, so that is why knowing to be."" [Agent] ""OK, oK."" [Customer] ""Does it make sense what I am saying?"" [Agent] ""Because we do also have Optimum mobile services that we could even lower your monthly internet rate lower when bundling it with our internet. We have got rates as low as $25 a month, and that is unlimited talking text that does include XXGB of data, which is on the same T-Mobile network, but it is not going to include all of that international talking text like you were talking about."" [Customer] ""Yeah, so that is, that is uh the thing that I need when I travel, so. That is why I stick to this plan. That is all. Thanks for asking."" [Agent] ""And what is your email address?"" [Customer] ""The email address is? Um, Uh first of all, I got, uh, she texted me back the, the tax, uh, ID"" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""So that is XXXXXX-XXX."" [Agent] ""And your email?"" [Customer] ""Just a second."" [Agent] ""So I have to reach over to my support team and get them to add this address into our system. Can I do that while you are looking for your email?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, just a second. I am getting to. Sorry? Because also, I do not, I do not remember which email I use all the accounts. OK, so it is Uh, I, I am.

Services include protection and support through a sharing for additional tech support, as well as backup failover, which means should your internet ever go down, get up to X hours worth of backup internet as well so you do not lose any business There are no contractual obligations required. It is a XX month fixed rate."" [Customer] ""OK, and you said that was XX on top of the current bill?"" [Agent] ""Yes, so your new monthly rate would be XXX."" [Customer] ""OK, thanks for looking into that. Um, I definitely want to consider it. I just want to make sure cause uh I just want to have an understanding of what was sent to me too, um."" [Agent] ""Mhm mhm."" [Customer] ""Just cause the, the better I am looking at, they sell uh for different prices and it looks like even the lowest speed option is still higher than mine cause it looks like XXX megabits secure internet, business phone, business support."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm."" [Customer] ""That says XX per month for X year, the next is XXX for X years, and etc."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Right."" [Customer] ""So I just want to understand like what that is versus what I am considering here."" [Agent] ""That sounds like acquisition pricing, so the one that you are talking about right now for XXX megabytes, right? It would be it is a XX month offer for a brand new customer they get it at that rate."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""And it includes a phone line. That is a XX month offer. Then the one for, you know, $125 and you know, obviously those are the other two offers. Those are XX month offers. Those are those are like acquisition offers. Those are not upgrade options. The upgrade options to go to XXX megabytes for you would be for $50."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""And then um if you upgrade to um XXX megabytes that would be like $90 but these are the you are on our sales team so you do qualify for offers that you can get the gig for less than some of the stuff that they are sending to you right there. When the upgrade factor and most upgrade factors in general, it is not going to lower your bill to go to a higher speed."" [Customer] ""OK, OK. I mean, that, that makes sense to me. I think it was just, I, I was just confused I guess then why I was sent this specific mailer"" [Agent] ""OK. No, no worries, no worries. Right."" [Customer] ""Um, but in either case, um, OK, so XX on top, no contractual obligations and fixed rate for, uh, sounds like X years, right?"" [Agent] ""Mhm. Mhm. That is correct, and I could actually waive the installation fee, which means you do not have to pay for a tech to come out there and swap it out."" [Customer] ""OK. Um, I think that sounds good to me. Um, would I also do the tech scheduling with through you?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, I have availability actually as early as tomorrow between X and X."" [Customer] ""That would be Uh Uh, actually, tomorrow X to X would be great."" [Agent] ""We also have availability next week. What is the best number they could call when they are on their way?"" [Customer] ""Uh, that is XXXXXX."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Mhm."" [Customer] ""XXXX."" [Agent] ""May I ask you a question, do you use mobile phone for your business as well?"" [Customer] ""Uh, no, we did not."" [Agent] ""No, alright, well just to make you aware, Optimum is partnered with T-Mobile. We offer Optimum mobile plans, unlimited texts and talks. If you ever decide to, you know, add a mobile business line, the mobile plan starts as low as $45 for unlimited texts and talk. You can keep your existing device as well as your number. But if you were to, let us say get a business mobile phone with that $45 plan, they automatically give you an additional $40 off your internet as well."" [Customer] ""Mm, OK. That is good to know.""

[Agent] ""It is only XXXX that we have to take today. Uh, yeah."" [Customer] ""But you can not tell me a date of when it will be in my hand and I will be paying for it?"" [Agent] ""So So for the cell phone services, the cell phone services, when we ship out the cell phone, it normally, so we do a business verification for XX hours. We verify all the information that we have been given the debit cards, the business name, the tax ID, um, and then we ship the phone out to you. The phone normally comes to you within about."" [Customer] ""I do not want, I, I, I do not, it is going to be shipped. I do not want it. Never mind, cancel that. Um, I thought, I thought it would be given to us when they did the landline and everything else."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""I did not know it was like a third party ship out type thing. Maybe we will add it later. But um I do not trust shipping in this area. Things get stolen really easily."" [Agent] ""Oh OK. OK, yeah, that is the only way I have the ability to send you a phone would be shipping it."" [Customer] ""I would rather Yeah, and well, and, and paying for activation before you even receive it I normally you pay for the services from the day you get it. With any cell company, so I just do not want to pay for something that may not even show up."" [Agent] ""But I mean, would you like I mean with any shipping it, I mean with any like shipping when you have to activate a phone like if you do it through T-Mobile and Verizon, it is the same way they are not going to ship you something without like you paying the activation."" [Customer] ""Uh, I have US cellular. I go in, they hand me the phone I pay for and, and then there it is. I, I have never had a phone shipped."" [Agent] ""OK, that is fine because you have never had a phone shipped."" [Customer] ""Ever."" [Agent] ""It might be because you just like bought it at the store, but yeah, it does not look like we have availability."" [Customer] ""Yeah. Uh, yeah, I just go in personally. I would rather see it, get it, but pay for it, and trade right exchange, not, yeah, that is OK."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""We will just add it later, um. We will just add that one later."" [Agent] ""OK, you are always able to go in like."" [Customer] ""We will just do the landline with the landline? I am sorry will the landline be brought upon installation"" [Agent] ""So the technician does set it up, but you you purchase your own like your own landline phone"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""OK, and then you should know, you should know within a couple of hours with if we are able to install this weekend, um, if we are not able to, so I do have next weekend available, um as of right now we are trying to see if we have got something available this weekend for you"" [Customer] ""I do not even know where you can. I So, I have a question. If I have to purchase my own landline phone, then why am I paying you guys a service for it?"" [Agent] ""The service for the phone like to have the phone activated."" [Customer] ""Like what would the phone would, yeah, to have the phone activated, like, do I, do I pay somebody else for that too, or is that coming from you guys? Would you guys provide the phone number?"" [Agent] ""So yeah, we provide the phone number and the phone services to where you will be able to get calls into your business."" [Customer] ""OK, so it would just be the phone itself. Is there any specific qualifications for the landline that I would need?"" [Agent] ""No, just the basic one that you can pick up at Walmart."" [Customer] ""Perfect, thank you."" [Agent] ""Thank you."" [Customer] ""OK. Is that it?"" [Agent] ""Yes ma'am, if you do not need nothing else you are all good to go.""

[Agent] ""Exactly. Oh, You had some success? I have not."" [Customer] ""Uh, well, uh, on certain days and then other days I am like, wow, I wish my phone had died before I did that, yeah."" [Agent] ""Oh like why to do that. I love it. I am sorry that you have those bad days."" [Customer] ""Uh Oh gosh. Well, and I, I do take uh responsibility for it, but on the other hand, uh, it is been really rocking lately, uh, everybody, yeah."" [Agent] ""It has yeah. It has, um, I am, I am fairly new to it, so I can not really, um, I can not speak to it, um, but yeah, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is been difficult."" [Customer] ""I can not speak to her. Yeah, yeah, I, uh, I hope that will kind of smooth out for everyone soon."" [Agent] ""Mhm I hope so too. Um, I really, I have a friend that he, he is had some success in it he is made a, a good bit of money He is like, Rachel, do this. I am like, OK."" [Customer] ""But it is fun, it is a little bit addicting to me. It is hard to step away at times cause I have my day job too, which is uh as a teacher and I am like, uh, I can not be doing this in class and being distracted, you know, and, uh, so anyway, I, I teach uh"" [Agent] ""Oh. What do you teach? Do you teach in Bullet or Frankston or"" [Customer] ""Uh, I teach, uh, at an elementary school, 4th grade math and science."" [Agent] ""4th grade. Oh, OK. Oh, I know that is tough. You poor thing."" [Customer] ""I am trying to be smarter than a 5th grader, you know, it is like. And uh"" [Agent] ""Oh my gosh, are you on like, are they doing fractions and decimals and long division?"" [Customer] ""Yes, yes, yes, yes, exactly right, yeah, all of that."" [Agent] ""Oh my gosh, I remember it. It was a trying time for me."" [Customer] ""Well, well, I wish they would. That is the goal anyway, but uh sometimes."" [Agent] ""With the longer with the remainder at the end. Oh, I remember that."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, it is very hard. I, I have done it for a long time and it is just like it is universally hard for kids that age to grasp it."" [Agent] ""I Mhm I hate fractions. I still can not grasp fractions. Like I can not. I guess it is hard for me."" [Customer] ""Well, well, I, I think it is really."" [Agent] ""You are laughing I am being serious"" [Customer] ""Uh no, I, I get it. I, I do. I have to look things up myself at, at times, but I, uh, I I am grateful for chat GPT now I can just ask it anything but."" [Agent] ""And kids nowadays, they, if they have like the Alexa or Google Home at home, they just ask the Alexa, hey Alexa, what is the answer to this?"" [Customer] ""Uh-huh, yep. Yeah."" [Agent] ""I am like, that is not helpful."" [Customer] ""Yeah. I know, yeah, no, no, it is not, uh, adults sometimes I have got a friend that, uh, uh, they ask Alexa, the regular, uh, math problems like, you know, how much is this bill plus this bill and add them up on there, yeah I am like I never"" [Agent] ""Oh my gosh. Oh no. I am scared. I am, I, I am, I am embarrassed to say that while I am at the store and I see like, hey, this is a certain amount off or 50% off, not 50%, but like XX, uh, I will pull it up on Google."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Get the whisper in the phone. What is that discount?"" [Agent] ""Oh, I will go pull it up on the phone."" [Customer] ""Uh yeah, it seems like math is either."" [Agent] ""Oh my gosh, you are awesome."" [Customer] ""Uh, well, we have a good time with that for sure, but, uh, the kids, uh, do not, well, it is hard in the United States because some things like metric, we do use metric for some things that our standard or customary system is what we mainly use, you know, and that confuses the kids a lot. Uh, so, I, I do not blame them. I think sometimes other countries, uh, have it a little easier than we do. Another reason I am going off on a rabbit trail, but they do not change their curriculum."" [Agent] ""Oh you It is OK."" [Customer] ""It is like in inside."" [Agent] ""I was about to, I was about to, I was about to say that I am."" [Customer] ""Yeah, in China, they taught algebra the same way for thousands of years and, and we have to change it every few years and that is not helping."" [Agent] ""Uh. What is with the new math?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah."" [Agent] ""Like why do they have to show X steps to do X X?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah."" [Agent] ""What is, what is with that?"" [Customer] ""Right. Well, I, I am, I am no spring chicken."" [Agent] ""Why?"" [Customer] ""I was back in school a long time ago and I really have, uh, I had to look that up because I would not talk that way. I do not know what that is about, you know, but it is on their start test, so I have to teach it, you know, but yeah, kind of crazy."" [Agent] ""Oh. Yes Like, when my son's out at home, I am like, what do you mean show all these steps to do one plus one."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, exactly."" [Agent] ""What do you mean? There is, it is just what are you talking about?"" [Customer] ""I am like, oh well, uh, I, I think my kids are pretty bright uh in class and I do not discount that, but I am like, let us keep it simple. Let us just find one way that works and stick with it."" [Agent] ""Yes, yes, why do we do that?"" [Customer] ""I do not know."" [Agent] ""Oh my gosh, thank you for saying that."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I am, I am, it is for real. I am like, oh my goodness, like, and then when I send the homework home, which I rarely do because most parents are not familiar with it and, you know, even I, I would not want to tell my child something different than the teacher tells them, you know, I am just like, well, you know, cause I can figure it out that I might do it a different way and but"" [Agent] ""Thank you. Exactly."" [Customer] ""So, uh, I, I have gotten where I post videos."" [Agent] ""No, thankfully there is there is YouTube."" [Customer] ""Yes, yes, yes, yep, yep, uh, whatever we are doing, uh, because all of them have like access from home now to look at their assignments online, you know , uh, I will put"" [Agent] ""Yes, videos, thank you, yes, yes. I know"" [Customer] ""Post a video next to it in case there is a parent that wants to go to that much effort, you know, I, I applaud that, good for you, you know, I, most of them do not even care if their kids do the homework, that is why I do not assign it. I am like it is just not worth the hassle, but, uh, so I will post a little video if it is long division or fractions or whatever and, and they can watch."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Uh, I am not confident enough in myself to make a video of me doing it, but if somebody else has already done it, I will borrow theirs."" [Agent] ""My son, he is in high school. He started 9th grade this year and the stuff that he brings home, I am like, oh, let us, let us reach out to the teacher's."" [Customer] ""Oh yeah. Well,"" [Agent] ""Can you stay for tutorials?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, right, right."" [Agent] ""Can you go to school early after because I am lost I was great in school"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""I was, I was a kid that would correct the teacher, um, but when it comes to this new stuff, I can not handle it."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, well, I understand completely because I uh did not challenge myself in school."" [Agent] ""Mm"" [Customer] ""I took the easy way out and just took consumer math, fundamental math and got enough to graduate then when I went to college, I am like, OK, I got to take the remedial class before I get into the real class and Uh, so it is a good testimony to the kids is like, do not do that to yourself you know"" [Agent] ""Do not do it"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Oh you are awesome, Mr. Jim, you are awesome."" [Customer] ""Well, thank you. Uh, you have been very helpful. I sure appreciate you."" [Agent] ""It is no problem."" [Customer] ""I mean, I am looking for."" [Agent] ""Alright, let me, let me look at your bill for residential. I think you are paying like $159 for the highest tier that they had available at the time, but let me see what I can do because you also want that backup connection."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""So give me one second, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Um, Actually it will work. So if I add on because normally it is more expensive with business, um I will see if I can add on an extra discount for this to help you out"" [Customer] ""Well, thank you."" [Agent] ""I am trying, I am trying, yeah, this would have put it at $200. This would have definitely increased it. So with the XGB, what I will do is I will try to match the price for that you are currently paying for the higher speed if you wanted to add on that backup connection It is just going to be $30 more, um, XXX, um, a month so a little bit cheaper than than $30 more, $185 a month"" [Customer] ""That is fine. OK."" [Agent] ""Um, but that is before taxes, so $188 after taxes. So what is your, you know, $3 more it is the same, um."" [Customer] ""It is well worth it. All of it is worth it. I, I promise I would have paid more so."" [Agent] ""Oh hey, I will add on more if you want me to uh."" [Customer] ""If it goes straight in your pocket, it might be worth it, but."" [Agent] ""No, no, you are good, you are good."" [Customer] ""OK OK."" [Agent] ""Um, so it will be a X year promotion. There is no contracts. It also does give you a shuon for your devices that connect to the internet. So if you have a computer, if you have a smart TV, if you have devices that connect, you will get a Shuon like Premier protection and support as well for that same rate."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Um, the earliest date that we can get a technician out there for you is going to be the 29th between XX and X. Um, and I can also take care of that install fee since you are migrating from a residential to a commercial account if you would like."" [Customer] ""OK, OK, alright. OK, does someone need to be there when they are there?"" [Agent] ""Someone at least XX years of age has to be present. Um, I know that you, you are a teacher."" [Customer] ""Uh, could you Uh, could it be the following Friday, like the whatever I am off every Friday from our school."" [Agent] ""Um, would your wife by chance be there or? So I can do it on a Friday. However, um, with our promotion with our installs, I can not waive the install if it is not in April."" [Customer] ""Oh OK, OK, uh, so, uh."" [Agent] ""So if you want to do it for Friday the 2nd, there is an install fee."" [Customer] ""I, between XX and X. Yeah."" [Agent] ""Yes, between XX and X."" [Customer] ""OK, yeah, we can, we can arrange to be there on did you say the twenty-ninth"" [Agent] ""OK"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Yes, um, next Tuesday. Now if you get there, um, and you that you miss the tech and you need to reschedule, then you still get the free ins if you need reschedule after the tech comes out and you miss them, but if you are there, you just all the pay, you are good, um, let me do a full recap for you."" [Customer] ""OK, oK. OK. You"" [Agent] ""And then I will submit it you will get an email confirmation of everything One last thing before I do that though, I do not know if you are aware we have mobile service We actually have it for our business customers too. You can get two lines for the price of one, which is $45 you also get $40 off the internet Would you be interested in that today?"" [Customer] ""Uh, maybe, uh, what is the, I, I am probably asking a loaded question, uh, I do not know, but I have AT&T and I am not totally satisfied with AT&T because when I drive to my job in Overton, then there are places that I do not get good service over there, so is there."" [Agent] ""You."" [Customer] ""Do you know how that compares necessarily?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, I got you. I understand what you are saying. Um, we work off T-Mobile towers. I know here in Flint it is, it is really good. Um, Frankston, I do not have any issues when I am driving through Frankston. I do not, I do not even know where Overton is, so I am not going to lie to you, um we work off T-Mobile towers They have the largest XG coverage in the US, and the great thing is there is no contract, so say you get it, you are not happy with it, you can always cancel it, um, but if you get it, you like it, you love it, save the money."" [Customer] ""OK. Uh-huh. OK, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that sounds good to me. I am willing to give it a try because I am, I am not, uh, you know, sold on the AT&T right now, because even in my classroom, I have to go stand by the window to make a call I am like, this is so antiquated"" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""I do not should have either."" [Agent] ""Honestly, you are not the first person to say that. I have people that live in Henderson, Tyler, also where I stay at AT&T is not the best coverage in these cities, so I, I, I, I get that a lot"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I am close to Henderson in Overton."" [Agent] ""Um."" [Customer] ""That is kind of where it is over there."" [Agent] ""XX, is it like the, is it like going to, it is not going to to Shreveport, is it?""

[Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, yeah."" [Agent] ""OK, I am familiar with it, but yeah, if you get it, you are unsatisfied with it, you can cancel it, go back to AT&T, but if you get it, you are happy with it. Not only are you paying $245 for two lines, unlimited talk, text, and data plus whatever taxes is $47 maybe at the most, but then you also get that $40 off your internet."" [Customer] ""OK, that is a great bargain, thank you."" [Agent] ""Did you want to go ahead and set that up today?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, uh-huh, yeah."" [Agent] ""Yes, OK, so I would need to have the IVI numbers on your current phone to make sure that it is compatible with our service. What type of phone do you have?""

You, you will not believe this, and I really would not either if I was not telling you the story about myself, but my wife and uh son both are uh ADD and I am his stepdad, but anyway, I just see all they go through and I have been a teacher for a long time and they were telling me, you have the same indicators, you know, we watch you and it seems like you are distracted at times and so Even being my age, I went to the psychologist and he diagnosed me with AD&D ADD about uh a month ago."" [Agent] ""What?"" [Customer] ""And so I have been taking the meds recently and so it really does help focus for sure."" [Agent] ""What? Yes. My son's teachers tell me I can tell when he takes his medicine when he does not take his medicine"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""I am like, oh my gosh."" [Customer] ""I have got something class out there."" [Agent] ""So yes, I may take you up on those lessons."" [Customer] ""OK. All right. Well, you have all my contact information so.""

Uh Well, I had not made any bad trades today so I got my sense of humor"" [Agent] ""I am terrible. I know it."" [Customer] ""So on another day I might kick the cat or something.""

Now with the the second line for free for your wife, once you activate the service for the 1st X to X months, you will see that the bill is $60 instead of the $47 that I am quoting you because it takes about X to X billing cycles to add that discount on, OK?""
