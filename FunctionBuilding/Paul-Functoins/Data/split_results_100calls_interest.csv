Um Will not work with none of the new phones where our phone services are going in and out Our internet is slow as myuzo, um. Even though we have XXX megabytes per second, we are still dropping out with Internet daily, um, and somebody came out and said oh it is not the modem, but the modem is like a XXXX modem."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Our system is older than that. Our phone system is older than that, so we will we would like a representative to come out to see what could be possibly done to get our systems up to date"" [Agent] ""OK. OK, and what is the address that you are speaking of?"" [Customer] ""Um, XXX South Heritage Street."" [Agent] ""And the zip code for that?"" [Customer] ""XXX-XX our phone systems are so old we can not even get phones. That can run caller ID."" [Agent] ""Now do you have phones through us do you have a separate phone system like, like do we provide the phone like the physical phones to you do y'all just purchase your own physical phone"" [Customer] ""Um No, our phones, no, I mean we have had these spring up."" [Agent] ""OK, so let me see, so you only."" [Customer] ""That is how old our system is. I mean we are using phones that work with the system that we have upstairs that is through the phone company. Our boxes and stuff and they are so oh we can not get new phones. Because they will not work with Trot. I mean we can not even get a business phone in here with caller ID because it will caller ID it these phones will not work with our system because they are so old."" [Agent] ""OK, we do have the ability to provide you with a phone system, but also looking at your account here, you do also have some older codes on the account because caller ID is a feature that everyone should have that it should easily go with it, um, now with."" [Customer] ""But that is what I am saying the system upstairs is so old. It will not allow it. The new phones to work with because the phones that we have do not have caller ID."" [Agent] ""OK, so now you are."" [Customer] ""But when we try to put a phone that like what we have got a newer phone. It will not work because our system is not compatible with the system."" [Agent] ""And who is your who is your system upstairs to?"" [Customer] ""Upstairs. Yeah But it is been here so long Optimum did not install it."" [Agent] ""Yeah, because I do not think you have any type of phone system through us. All you are going to have through us is you are going to have a modem. The modem then connects analog phones. It is not a phone system, it is just basic analog phones, um."" [Customer] ""No, I am saying is all wiring and stuff for our business lines. Which I mean we have phones for y'all like you know we get our phone. With y'all. I mean we got our phone in long distance with business features, features that we are not able to."" [Agent] ""So I mean, so we supply you because I think that might be where the confusion is we do not supply the phone system."" [Customer] ""Yeah No."" [Agent] ""Your phone system is probably just needing to be upgraded however you need to upgrade it."" [Customer] ""This stuff upstairs, that is the phone wires. All that upstairs is what is preventing us from updating our phones. And that is through the phone company. The phone company installed that."" [Agent] ""What phone company?"" [Customer] ""The one that was"" [Agent] ""Like I"" [Customer] ""Well y'all bought them out so technically yes y'all."" [Agent] ""OK. Let us see, and"" [Customer] ""I mean y'all just kind of inherited this account."" [Agent] ""So you also, you also mentioned the internet as well, the XXX meg internet."" [Customer] ""When y'all bought it."" [Agent] ""How many devices would you say you have connected to the internet?"" [Customer] ""Maybe X."" [Agent] ""Just like X computers, no personal devices, no tablets, no TVs."" [Customer] ""Um, we have. X computers. We have one camera system. And X printers that run Wi Fi and that is it."" [Agent] ""How many cameras are on the camera system?"" [Customer] ""Not that many."" [Agent] ""OK, because those count as devices too, because most businesses I do not normally recommend the XXXX. If a business comes into me, especially in automotive business that is needing to pull out quotes and loans and stuff along those lines, we normally are going to recommend a faster speed like our X gig for that."" [Customer] ""Well, like I said, our modem. It is from XXXX, but they said there is nothing wrong with it I know there is"" [Agent] ""So I mean we can offer to get you an upgrade on the account which would bring in new, a new modem, new equipment, and it would upgrade all the codes on your account."" [Customer] ""Well that is what we would like we, we really want a representative to come out so they can see what we are dealing with because we tried to beforehand and they are like oh there is not a problem, but they need to somebody needs to physically come out here that is a representative to see what we are dealing with. Because I mean technicians just look at it and say oh no there is not a problem there is a problem because we can say oh we are getting upgrades all we want like you said we are supposed to we are paying for caller ID"" [Agent] ""So I do not have"" [Customer] ""We do not have car."" [Agent] ""Well, you also have very old codes on the account. Your codes are very old because it does not look like you have ever gotten a new promotion on the account. It does not look like we have ever really upgraded the account um, so your phone codes are very old now we can offer I was looking here because I do not have the ability to send out a technician. Uh, we, I just do not, are not a technician, a representative. I do not have the ability to just send somebody out, um, but what I can do is I can offer you to upgrade the codes on your account get you into a faster speed, so you would get a brand new modem, um, let us see"" [Customer] ""What I mean why do we want to put more money in here when we can not when we are dropping completely out daily."" [Agent] ""I mean it might be that the one the the XXX does not work for you to have something lop out daily."" [Customer] ""It do not matter if I can No I mean we have had issues we have had issues for years This has nothing to do with this has to do with our equipment. And our wiring. That is what I am trying to say we do not want to put more money into something that we are still having issues with."" [Agent] ""So I mean, the only OK then all I can really offer you is to get you over to tech support."" [Customer] ""That is why we really need somebody to come out. OK, maybe somebody. OK, let us do that."" [Agent] ""Because I mean because you are in so now I can offer you Intels to get you a faster speed which is going to get you brand new equipment as well as all of our brand new equipment comes with what is called the connection backup so anytime your system does fail like you are stating it automatically turns on to keep supporting your devices. This would also update your phone codes on the account and so I mean just just looking here at what we can offer right off the bat."" [Customer] ""Because I mean we are paying $15 a month for Internet equipment. I do not even know what that is."" [Agent] ""It is your modem, your modem upstairs that supports the services."" [Customer] ""The one that we have had since XXXX."" [Agent] ""So yeah, so we can get you in a faster speed of equipment, a faster modem we can get you in that connection back up and get all of your codes updated as well as put you into a new promotion because right now you are not in any type of promotion so the the rate just is going to keep increasing because of that I mean I can offer you all of this at just an additional XXXX and then no installation charge to send out the technician to upgrade the equipment"" [Customer] ""So I mean it is like we would have all new wiring put in."" [Agent] ""So the technician comes out he is going to check your modem and change out your modem and the wiring to your modem When you say wiring, are we talking about the Ethernet cables from the modem to the phones?"" [Customer] ""No, we do not have Ethernet cables to the phones."" [Agent] ""How do you connect your phones to the equipment?"" [Customer] ""We have regular phone lines. That is how old our phones is."" [Agent] ""When you say regular. So then yeah he would update the lines as well he would update whatever needs to be updated because you are getting an upgrade."" [Customer] ""So what would that be look like a month?"" [Agent] ""Um, it looks like it would bring it up to 2:30."" [Customer] ""OK, that is something I would have to discuss with the. Owner before I can authorize that."" [Agent] ""Do you want to put me on hold and reach out to him since I mean you have got someone who is trying to help you?"" [Customer] ""Um. So what all will that entail with that extra charge?"" [Agent] ""What do you mean by that? Like what"" [Customer] ""OK, so right now we are paying about $170."" [Agent] ""Upgrades are you getting? OK. And so this would bring it up to 229.50."" [Customer] ""Yeah I am So how much is that speed?"" [Agent] ""So beforehand your XXX meg internet you are paying about XXXX. This brings it up to XXX plus we are putting additional discounts of $120 on there to cover the connection back up as well as your phone lines. So you are really, you are just seeing the additional $49.50 dollars monthly you are getting almost double the speed, the connection back up you are getting a new promotion on your account XXX megabytes per second."" [Customer] ""And so that is connection back up XXX megabytes this will completely upgrade our phone systems"" [Agent] ""Yes, he is going to come out there, he is going to upgrade the modem if the lines need to be changed as well, he will change those as well."" [Customer] ""And it is a $120. Savings."" [Agent] ""So you get a promotional discount of $120. So when he sees his bill every month, or she, whoever the owner is, and they see their bill every month, but how we price it out is you are going to see the full rates for everything, so you are going to see that $245 for the internet, you are going to see $20 for the phone, the $30 for the connection back up, and then in the end we put $120 in discounts on there to bring it down to the $229."" [Customer] ""OK, and how long is this promotion good for?"" [Agent] ""This is a X year price guarantee. It is not a contract. It is just a price guarantee for the next X years."" [Customer] ""OK, let me put you on hold."" [Agent] ""OK, thank you."" [Customer] ""XX WN Ma'am?"" [Agent] ""Yes ma'am."" [Customer] ""OK, so he said I just got off the phone with him. He said, um, what would be if we added like Internet phones? Or virtual assistants or whatever, how would that work?"" [Agent] ""So our voice over IP services is that what you are talking about?"" [Customer] ""Uh yes."" [Agent] ""OK, how many phone lines do you have? Because I am seeing that you actually only have one with us."" [Customer] ""We have X lines."" [Agent] ""What are those phone numbers?"" [Customer] ""Uh da da da da. I want to think it is XXXX and then maybe XXXX maybe."" [Agent] ""OK, let me see in the XXXX let us see. Mm mm. Now why I ask how many lines you have with us is because our voice over IP phone system requires us to have a minimum of X lines."" [Customer] ""OK, we do not have, we have, we have X phones but only X lines."" [Agent] ""Yeah same. OK, both of those numbers are on here, so you do have two phone lines with us that is correct. OK. And then what does he think about doing the upgrade with the connection back up and the new promotion?"" [Customer] ""Um, he was, you know, like I said, was wanting to know about the internet thing, but it requires X lines."" [Agent] ""Mhm. It does require X lines, yes ma'am."" [Customer] ""So for actual phone numbers."" [Agent] ""Yes, so it would be X actual phone numbers as well as with um our VoIP services. Every phone would have to have a phone number, so you mentioned you have X phones, so then it would have to have a number pointed to that phone, um, so I believe that normally, uh, so X phones and the phones run $40.80 or XX $40.95 a piece, and so if we were to do X of those."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""It would be about XXX XX."" [Customer] ""Hold on X 2nd."" [Agent] ""Yeah, take your time. And then I did want to let you know that we could do this upgrade as soon as tomorrow morning. I have an X to XX or an XX to X."" [Customer] ""So he wants to know is the 2:30 the total bill if we do not go with the Internet phones."" [Agent] ""Yes ma'am, the 2:30 would be the total bill if you do not go with the Internet phones."" [Customer] ""And what is your name? I forgot to get that."" [Agent] ""Oh Lizzie."" [Customer] ""Is it um I or Y?"" [Agent] ""Oh, you can do I."" [Customer] ""OK, so Um, you said what are the times tomorrow?"" [Agent] ""X to XX or XX to X."" [Customer] ""Let us say XX to X.""

I am just going into your account now. And then let us see. So we will be adding a secondary line maybe as a roll over? Are you going to be using it for a roll over?"" [Customer] ""Uh, what do you mean? I, I it is my main number."" [Agent] ""Uh Oh OK I got it because I see one line already on the account so this would be a secondary number"" [Customer] ""Um Yeah. Yes, the, the other line is a fax line."" [Agent] ""Understood. Allow me a moment here and I will set up for the port. Uh, the cost for the line would be $40 since we are coming out for the line. Did you want to possibly upgrade the speed here because this address is fiber capable? We can actually upgrade you to fiber. And with the fiber you would be getting uh dedicated speeds here."" [Customer] ""So So what plan do I have right now?"" [Agent] ""You have a XXX megabits download coax connection um and about maybe XX megabits upload."" [Customer] ""Really?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, so you are at the lowest, uh, bandwidth for the coax."" [Customer] ""And how much is the uh fiber? Uh, OK, how much is the"" [Agent] ""Um, let me take a look and see what we could do here. I am just going to look at some upgrade offers. Sorry for the delay. I am just waiting for those offers to open up here. Sorry if I got quiet. I am just actually looking here for you. And then the modem rental would go away as well, bear with me. So if you were to add the phone line, sir, and upgrade to a fiber connection, the change in your monthly rate would be $80.05. So instead of $40 for the line it would be $80 you would also have the upgraded speed sir You would have a X gigabyte connection, uh, fiber, so that is X gig up, X gig down. You would be getting symmetrical speeds with the internet."" [Customer] ""Mm."" [Agent] ""And then with the fiber upgrade, you would actually save the phone the fee for the phone for the technician"" [Customer] ""Right. And What"" [Agent] ""So you would be getting uh, you know Greater speeds here, more productivity in your business."" [Customer] ""Right, uh, can we just do the, uh, uh, porting for now? I, uh, I have to leave for my other office and, uh. I will consider that in the, you know, uh, X or X days."" [Agent] ""Sure, well, the only thing is that with the porting it would be the same appointment time frame."" [Customer] ""Right now I am"" [Agent] ""If that makes sense so they could do both at the same time. And then with the upgrade you would also get a $50 gift card."" [Customer] ""Uh, Uh, no, not right now, just the, the X thing for now."" [Agent] ""OK, so the porting is the primary no worries, allow me a moment here and I am working on the date of when we can get that number for you, OK"" [Customer] ""I guess I got to go. OK."" [Agent] ""Bear with me one second."" [Customer] ""So that"" [Agent] ""Where is its own billing telephone number sir? With this current uh provider. So when you get a bill right now from your current provider, that number is the number that is associated with the bill the XXX-XXX"" [Customer] ""Yes XXX X."" [Agent] ""OK, I just want to make sure. XXX-XXXX, that is the number?"" [Customer] ""Well that is the one that we are reporting, right?"" [Agent] ""Yes, I am that is what I am confirming like when you get a bill from your other provider that is the number that is associated with the bill."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""OK. I am just running the number now through the system the system will indicate to me the first available port date, OK"" [Customer] ""XX The"" [Agent] ""We are almost set here sir sorry uh for the delay."" [Customer] ""We are all set."" [Agent] ""Uh, almost, um, the system is about to generate the first available date that that number would be available to be reported. I know you have to go, um. I am moving as quickly as possible here bear with me. So, let us see. The first available date that your provider would release that online to Optimum would be Monday the 5th of May. I could do X to XXXX to X, or X to X."" [Customer] ""Oh, is there any physical thing to do?"" [Agent] ""Yes, we actually send a technician out to provision the modem so the modem would be provisioned on site, sir"" [Customer] ""OK. Uh,"" [Agent] ""If that date does not work for you we could do Tuesday, Wednesday yeah, there is no lapse in service your number will continue to work with your current provider until then"" [Customer] ""Add the number. Oh, can we do, uh, Tuesday then?"" [Agent] ""Sure, and then what time frame did you want? X to XXXX to X, or X to X?"" [Customer] ""X to XX."" [Agent] ""And then the best contact number for the technicians to phone you, is that the number you are calling from XXXXXXX-XXXX."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""OK perfect. Let me just make sure that appointment is."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""Solidify before you go and confirm the email because what is going to happen is you are going to get what we call an electronic letter of authorization confirming the number and the email address that we have is BEBSG@aol.com."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""That is a good email? OK, just wanted to make sure so quick recap what we are doing is we are coming out."" [Customer] ""It is a good email."" [Agent] ""It is XXX South Street. This is in freehold"" [Customer] ""we are going to be adding a line The additional cost on your monthly would be $40. The one time fee, sir, for the technician to come out would be $79.99 dollars, and that is placed on the bill. You do not have to give any money. To the tech and there is no contracts and just so you are aware we do offer mobile service now for business so that is a way to save some money on your Optimum account we have unlimited mobile plans as low as $45 a month but then you would actually save $15 on your business account, OK? So it is something to, uh, keep in mind and we are part of the largest XG network. So the mobile number is good all over the state. Yes, so the network that we utilize for mobile service is T-Mobile, in case you are wondering what the network is, but it would be, it is nationwide. I have used it in Georgia, you know, uh, Florida, California, so we are, you know, nationwide the service is great Since the yeah since T-Mobile is. As free international calls, right? So no international would be handled on a per call basis you would have to add an international plan say if you were going to travel. Uh Alright, so. Uh, I do have some time right now. I am driving. OK. Uh, What is? My bill XXX when I am getting the lowest. Uh, Steve. Hold on, let us take a look here. So you are probably out of a promotion or whatever promotion that you started with originally, uh, that ended. Well, actually I, I had static IP. Mhm. And then I changed it. So it should be the lowest. Price Well, you are at the lowest bandwidth you are also out of a promotion on your account, like your actual optimum account is out of a promotion Because I changed If that makes sense. OK. I mean if you were looking to lower the bill may mobile would be one way that I could offer you a reduction on the bill by switching over your mobile service I could save you some money in other areas. So Uh, no, let us try like your standard. Basic, uh, business phone line right now this internet line. OK. How much is it? OK are you asking about new customer pricing or? Yes. OK, so if you were to do a XXX connection, that is XXX megabits down and XX or XX $50 up I should say, coax it would be $65 a month for one year. No customer price It is just a X year price guarantee and then the phone lines if you were to do a bundle, I could tell you what that would be. Bear with me. You have two phone lines. You would be looking at about $100 for one year. And then after one year it goes to the standard, uh, the standard pricing. For everything For for two lines and the uh the lowest. Uh, Internet, which is coax, that is correct sir. Correct What do you mean coax uh? Well, that is the type of connection that you have now. Well So with the coax, um, the speeds can, you know, vary depending on how many users you have utilizing the Internet, the time of day, how many devices whereas with the fiber, the fiber would be a guaranteed connection you would be getting guaranteed speeds there You would be getting symmetrical speed. How much is the fiber? So what I was offering you was a fiber upgrade, uh, the phone line and the fiber upgrade, the whole thing would have came to $80 more you would be getting, you know, more than like triple the speed of what you currently have The bonus speed. That is correct sir. But you have a XXX. Megabyte speed too, right? Like X gig is is one of your max. X gig is the fastest, uh yes, if you wanted to, did you want to hear what a XXX fiber would be Yes Yes. So we do not charge more for fiber than coax just so you know because some customers think we do um there is no we charge more for fiber so if fiber is available in your area, we would offer fiber just because it is, you know, the better connection so to speak. So We do not have any fiber in our area. You do. So that is why I quoted you fiber. You do have fiber in this area. Oh So that is why I uh quoted fiber I could tell you if you wanted to do like a XXX fiber as opposed to a gig I could tell you what that would be. Bear with me. Yes. And so where the fiber rates were coming up before and now they are not so we are just saying. If I can add man on. It is so all of the fibroids are not coming up. Uh, it is really weird. They were just coming up. Let us see if I could just tell you what the difference would be so this way if it is something you wanted to move forward with. Uh, no, no, I am more interested in pricing. Yeah, no, I know I am just trying to figure out the price because for some reason the rates are not populating now and they were earlier. I am not sure if it is because we put through the change for the phone, so I am just going to try to tell you what the rates would be and try to manually do it for you. Yes. So if you were to upgrade to like the XXX fiber, the cost difference would be $50 instead of $80. $50 a month. More, yeah, and that would be for the line and the XXX fiber. With the line Mhm. Uh Explain that. So where we be porting the phone line from your, yeah, so your bill would increase by $50 instead of $40 you would be getting the faster connection here, so you would be having a fiber connection So what is the total bill with fiber? Uh, so from XX it becomes XX. That is correct. Right? And then you add the phone line. But you That is including the phone line, sir. That is including the phone line. That is what is the monthly bill then? Let us see here, so your monthly bill now. It is just by adding the phone line, I could tell you. So your total monthly bill right now sir would be XXX. Well, can you break it down to XX? So the phone lines are $40 each. OK, so that is $80 for the voice, and then your internet, uh, let us see. XXX minus XX. Your internet charges are XXX sir. Uh, XXX, so, uh, XXX megabyte is XXX. That is correct. Right now you have a XXX megabytes coax and that is XXX. So if I choose fiber XXX. With the new uh contract, how much is that? So it is not a contract, it would be just an upgrade promotion and your bill would increase by $50 so I was giving you a promotion and that is including the phone line. So if I were to sign up. You It is XXXXX phone lines. How much is it? So if you were to do the half a gig, hold on, I will tell you. You would be with with auto pay you would be at XXX without auto pay you would be about $140 a month. With auto pay is XXX. That is correct. If you were looking to lower your overall optimum bill, you could always speak with our retention group when you had a chance, and they would be able to review your account so that is the department that would be able to maybe, uh, you know, if they could lower your bill. Retention group so I could get a lower bill. Yeah Well, I am just saying if you were looking to have it be more in line with new customer pricing. Then XXX. Uh So But later on if I if I were to support my numbers again somewhere that $40 will go away. That is correct if you poured out again, yes. Because you switch providers. Uh Right. So right now, why do not we do the uh. Fiber at XXX. OK, I am going to just get my support team on the line to assist for some reason the fiber rates are not populating for me, but I can get them on the line to see if they can assist. They could Um Yeah, is it OK if I. You can lower it further. Uh So it is an upgrade so I do not have the ability to lower the bill because this is the sales department unfortunately that is why I was saying if you were looking to get like a lower rate you could speak with our retention group. I am sorry, sir did I lose you No Oh I am here. Yeah, so did you, uh, for some reason I would have to get sales escalations involved now because now the fiber rates are not populating they were previously, uh, would it be OK if I called you back? Uh, call me back Once I have the order once I have the order placed, did you want to go ahead and upgrade uh to the the fiber because we may have to cancel, they may have to help me modify the additional or the original order to get the fiber in there for you. OK, so do you have the numbers in front of you now? Sure, I just want to confirm XXXXXXXXXX. Yeah, that is my number, yep. Yeah, I just want to confirm once I have the fiber rates added for the XXX. OK, you can call me. Yeah. Can you do it in XX minutes? Sure, I am going to reach out to my sales escalations. They are going to need to assist me. OK, I just want to make sure and then I can call you back and recap it with you. And uh. Right And your number would be XXX. It would be an XXX number, yes. It is uh which location and I will pick it up if uh. Uh, I am not sure. It is, it is just going to come through with the XXX number. It may say optimum. Alright, I will It does not say so I will just take a chance. Yeah, I will call you back shortly, sir, OK? But yeah OK Thank you. Alright have a great day.""",Potential Interest as a Lead,"The customer showed interest in upgrading to fiber and inquired about pricing, but requested to proceed with porting the number first and consider the fiber upgrade later, indicating potential interest in exploring further options.",Upselling and Cross-Selling Strategies

[Agent] ""Oh wow."" [Customer] ""And you can not, I can not get, you are on the phone for 2.5 hours on hold and it, it just I am not getting anywhere so I am done"" [Agent] ""Right, it is hard, no, it is hard.

[Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""We have people local all over the all over Long Island.

[Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""OK, that is fine. In terms of internet, are you going to have credit card machines? Are you going to have laptops?"" [Customer] ""Yeah Yeah, it is the computer and yeah, it has a credit card machine and it also has my wire service tele for that comes through it."" [Agent] ""Are you going to have a lot all the above? Mhm. Perfect. So the great thing about this location is that we offer fiber. So the fiber is extremely fast and reliable and the speed of the it is XGB which is XXXX megs upload and XXXX megs download. So pretty much extremely fast and it is fiber. I will break down the bill. um, so the internet portion of the bill is $125. And then the telephone uh $30 a line. So if you have X lines, it is $90. So it is $90 for X telephone lines and then $125 for the internet all together it is $215 a month. And then, and that is pretty much it, uh, because you get in a double play, the installation is free there are no of course fees And I can put a rush job on it and see how fast we can go and fix you know, and install the service How does that sound?"" [Customer] ""Mhm. Yeah, it is a high, it seems like."" [Agent] ""But, I mean, you are getting, you know, you are getting that, you are getting the best, you are paying for the the best service It is X gig fiber. That is why it is $125. I do not know what speed of internet you have now. Do you know what speed internet you have?"" [Customer] ""No, no."" [Agent] ""Yeah, see, with us it is one gig fiber. That is what you, I mean you are paying for it. That is why it is so, it is so strong. And if something were to happen with us in the in the situation, our modem. Has XG uh cell phone tower.

So if that something would happen with us, we come to fix your issue within X to X hours and our cell phone our modem kicks in to uses Wi Fi towers So your credit card machines will still work even though you had a modem, even though you have an outage, whereas Verizon, you know, X or X days, look how much money you are losing by not having internet. That would not happen with us because of our, our Wi Fi modems. And uh a cell phone power modems so you are paying for the value, you know."" [Customer] ""Right, that"" [Agent] ""Now here is the situation we would have to request Verizon to give us the telephone numbers."" [Customer] ""Right"" [Agent] ""So the balls in their court in terms of how fast we can go because we we would, you know, you want to obviously keep the same telephone number that Verizon has so we have to report it called porting when we report the numbers over."" [Customer] ""I Right."" [Agent] ""So it, it is up to that. I mean, I will let you know in X minutes how fast it will release the numbers, but it is up to them to release the numbers. It might take a day, usually it takes X days for Verizon to release it sometimes too. Do you know what the XX telephone numbers are that you want to pour over?""

[Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""That is, you know, let me see, let me, give me a second, let me see what that does. Because Verizon does that because they do not want to lose business they do not want to lose you, you know, they do not want us. They do not want to lose you as a customer because they just wait a week."" [Customer] ""Yeah, well, the problem that, you know, I already told them that this started on Thursday."" [Agent] ""They do it all the time."" [Customer] ""Spoke to him Thursday, spoke to them Friday, literally been on the phone for over X hours on hold trying to get to speak to somebody and all you get is, you know, oh we are working on it.""

[Customer] ""You are not telling me what is happening and you are telling me the service will be up by X o'clock and now we are on day X and I still have no service and no one's come by or nobody's looked at it but now like nothing."" [Agent] ""Let me see if we go there and I think."" [Customer] ""My phone lines are working. It is my internet that is not working."" [Agent] ""Right, I am sorry, because, OK, so let, hold on. We can put the internet then we can port the numbers over, you know"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""We can go this Wednesday XX or X I can put a request in for tomorrow"" [Customer] ""Um, you know what, I will not be, uh, what, what is today? Today is Monday."" [Agent] ""We have Wednesday XX or X or X to X or Thursday the 1st X to XXXX."" [Customer] ""For Wednesday? Wednesday Wednesday is fine. I will be there all day Wednesday."" [Agent] ""So, so let us recap what I am going to do is I am going to install the internet and X temporary telephone numbers. Once we are installed Wednesday, then, um, we can call you can call back and say you want to port the numbers, and then we will do the process of porting the numbers over and then we can go back and port the numbers over afterwards. But for now we can just install the internet with X temporary telephone numbers so you will have service. OK."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""I am going to give you your account number.

Um, did you want one phone number?"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Did you want two phone numbers for rollover just in case the first line is busy, it could roll over to the next line. What are we doing as far as services?"" [Customer] ""Yeah. OK, we want one number we want to roll over"" [Agent] ""OK, so basically what happens is that the system's going to generate X phone numbers in your menus and everything."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""You are just going to advertise the primary number. So when somebody calls that number, if that number is busy, it is going to roll over to the next number."" [Customer] ""OK.""

[Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And as far as the internet service, we will be able to install our gig speed of service so that is definitely going to help you with getting um your orders from DoorDash and things of the sort because you are going to go on all those platforms as well, right?"" [Customer] ""OK. Yes ma'am."" [Agent] ""Beautiful. OK, perfect. So let me just make sure I bring out the right equipment and let me just put in the promos for the service.""

[Agent] ""OK, let me know when you are ready as far as the services are concerned so I can give you the pricing options then we can see how quickly we can get somebody out there for you, OK"" [Customer] ""Yes, ma'am, you are ready."" [Agent] ""Oh, beautiful. Alrighty then, so as far as the speed, the gig speed of service is the industry standard. It is basically what most businesses have, especially when you are at a restaurant, because what that does is that it allows you to run your credit cards. It allows you to do multiple businesses like DoorDash , you know, Uber Eats and get quick orders Also, if you need to set up cameras, are you going to have security camera at the location?"" [Customer] ""Yes, sir."" [Agent] ""OK, so perfect. So you have plenty of speed for your cameras as well, and if you have maybe a computer in the office to place orders, maybe you have a printer, and maybe you have a cell phone or two that needs to connect to Wi Fi. So with the gig speed of service you will have plenty of services there. Um, can you tell me how many registers you plan on having? Is it just going to be one, you are going to have X?"" [Customer] ""Register is going to be XX."" [Agent] ""OK perfect thank you so you will be able to connect that POS system, good to go. Um, as far as the phone numbers we spoke about the two lines, um, this technician's going to go out to the location. He is going to install a modem, potentially a router as well if it is not a XXX, and he is going to also install a connection wireless failover service, a modem for that. That means that if at any point there is a down on the main internet service, it will automatically switch to switch over to the LTE failover service so that your main devices, your main X devices can continue to work. That means your cameras continue to work, your credit cards continue to work until we get out there and fix the main internet service. It is all failover service so it backs it up automatically. Um, let us take a look. The installation one time charge of $100 no money due to me, no money due at the door. Everything gets billed out to you and um, as far as the monthly rate, including the two phone numbers, including the modem, the router. Your Premier technical support, your $5 your premier technical support and the connection fail over service that'll be $200. That is a X year promotion without any contracts or cancellation charges so we can definitely go ahead and um see how quickly we can get somebody out there for you. So just sit tight for me a few moments and I will advise on the installation date, OK."" [Customer] ""Mhm"" [Agent] ""The phone numbers are unlimited, so wherever you need to call, you do not have to worry, you know, wherever your providers are the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico, that is all there. I am going to need a X digit access code for your account."" [Customer] ""Mhm Just a second. What X digits would you like that to be, please? Mhm. Uh, the, the, the people who is running right now, they said that they are, they are paying only XXX per month. Same everything they have everything same and they are paying only XXX but you are saying XXX. OK, so let us go ahead and take a look and see what um they had. OK, so it is definitely not the same, um, the service, the service that they had was the basic XXX speed and that promotion that they had before, that promotion is slated to end in, well, I mean they already set up their disconnection, but that promotion was slated to end in July, so in July. That pricing structure. With that basic XXX speed, that price would have gone up to XXX to XXX. So, you are getting a faster speed? For less money than what let us say you were keeping their account, then they would have been paying come July. You would have been paying XXX for a much slower speed for a XXX meg circuit as opposed to a X gig speed of circuit. The conquest only child now you can go. Yeah. They also do not, they also do not have the failover service, meaning if that main internet is down, Automatically clicks over to that LTE network. They did not have that on the account. This is a new product that Optimum is offering, and it normally is $30 right now with the promotion as a new customer, you would be getting it for $20. And that saves a lot of money cause if for any reason, your internet is down, which is not happening very often, but whenever it does, you can not process your credit card terminals. You can not go ahead and get online. With the failover service, it automatically clicks over and uses the LTE towers to use that internet service while we fix the main one. Mhm I So that those are things that it is the the package that I am offering you is a lot more complete than what they had before. So just giving you the heads up on that and that promotion was ending in July, so it would have gone up $125 to $245. In less than X months. So you, you will not be able to reduce more than this XXXX. I can go ahead and speak to my I can go ahead and speak to my supervisor and see if there is anything that he can go ahead and do as far as the services and keeping you at, you know with the modem, the router and the failover service which is a very important part, um, bear with me just a few moments and A of Yes. Yes please. Mhm. I will go ahead and message him and see if there is anything that he can go ahead and do. To me. But we did not So you, you will, you will put the new modem everything, right, ma'am? Yes, of course, mhm, yeah, because they already disconnected their their account they put in a disconnection, yeah, they are put in the disconnection already. You replace everything, right? Yeah, oK. OK, oK, OK. OK, so you can just talk to your manager and let me know should should I be in the hold you know Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, just stay on the line, yeah, no, no, stay on the line. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I am sending him a message right now. Yes, please. Thank you. Yeah, yes. OK, just sit tight for me a couple of seconds. I appreciate it. Now they had the XXX speed. Are you hoping to stay at the gig speed of service would you want to do a XXX speed or something along the lines, um, depending on the price Oh, the one which you gave just now is XXX or XXX now. Gig, which is the equivalent of XXXX megs. That is the, that is the industry standard now. That is like what most businesses do, which is the gig speed, which is XXXX megs versus XXX megs or XXX MBs. So XXX megs is not what I would go ahead and suggest for your business type, especially if you are going to be having a camera or POS and your computer and and doing online ordering, I would not suggest that. So we can do either the price for the XX for the XXX or the XGB. Let me go ahead and. XXX Let me go ahead and work on that, bear with me just a few moments. It Oh, OK. The XXX is almost twice as fast as what they had before, so that is still a good thing and if this still is a X year promotion still with no contracts and no cancellation charges, keeping the failover service, your two phone numbers. Let us take a look here. Mhm. Because he is the one. OK, we can go ahead and provide you a XXX speed. With your modem, your router, the failover service, and the two phone numbers, and that would be XXX. OK. Yeah yeah. And that is a X year promotion, that would be a X year promotion as opposed to, yeah, that would be a X year promotion as opposed to. Mm what about. OK, uh, how much is for the XXXXX, ma'am? Um, the difference if, um, right now I could go ahead and do XXX with the the premier without the premier technical support. XXX. So basically just a second, let me just make sure that I get that price correct. Hold on, hold on, hold on. OK. That would be correct, yes, it would be XXX because all I did was take off the premier technical support. I So the difference between having the the XXX speed and the gig speed of service at this point with the discount that I am able to. Secure by removing the premier technical support, it would be $180 for the gig and $170 for the XXX speed. It is only a $10 difference for doubling the speed. That is why I always consider the gig speed of service to be the better value. It OK, just a second, hold on please. Yes ma'am, of course. Ma'am, just a quick question, so for XXX you said XXX and for X,XXX XXX, right? Yes, of course. Correct, it is only a $10 difference between the two. Different, but you said something about techni technician or something you were saying for XXX. What was that? Oh no, that was basically like there is additional products like the Premier technical support, the premier technical support, um, just like the connection fail over service is normally $30 with the premier technical support right now if you were adding it on, it would only be $20. Mhm. So when I go ahead and book our business customers. That is all part of the bundle because you get the additional discounts right now. Oh. Like if you were to add the Premier technical support, the Premier technical support helps you with networking past the demarcation point, meaning we always help you to your modem and your route. If something's not working, your modem and your router would always be checked, but if something's not working with your cameras, if something's not working with your POS system, you could call us and we can help you network it we can help you with identifying the situation and it also includes trouble calls that means that we need to send the technician out to the location and it is something that is not working on your end. You do not have to pay the trouble call, the $80 for trouble because it is already included in the Premier technical support. So those are things that most businesses nowadays have. Because not everybody can afford a um an IT guy at $120 an hour. OK Mhm OK, OK, just a second, let me explain to you. We could do that for you. We could do that, and it is only $20 a month. So if you wanted to add that premier technical support for the extra $20 that is where I came to the $200. Mhm. Hold on please, so. Yes, of course. OK, then we will go with the, with the $20 promotion as well along with that, ma'am. So you would like to go with $1000 then. OK perfect thank you so I will add up back on the. And I The premier technical support and the additional discount and what my supervisor will be able to do since we are going with this plan, he is able to go ahead and credit your installation um he is going to go ahead and give you $99.99 towards the installation only because he can not do $100 because the code needs to be there. Yeah. Mhm. So he is going to go ahead and do a no charge installation because of the fact that so that is something that he is going to be able to do, OK? Oh, OK. So it will be no charge for the install $200 for the service then the taxes are going to be $10 Thank you. List you can do that as well and that'll give you an additional $5 discount so if you want to set up auto pay and paperless, you can do that through the. Autopay for another month, $5 discounted. Yeah, it gives you, yeah, if you ever want to set up autopay and paperless, it gives you an additional $5 discount. Yeah OK. Once you are installed, you once you are installed you can go ahead and do autopay and paperless And uh OK, OK, and installation fee on the charge fundvent or done that, let us see, OK. Yeah, right now you are not going to be charged. You are only going to be charged a penny for the installation. He is crediting you the install. OK, OK. Can I please have a X digit access code for the account, please? OK. X digits that is easy for you to remember. OK, uh, uh, yeah, it is XXXX. XXXX. OK, sit tight for me just a couple of seconds. Let me see how quickly I can get somebody out there for you, OK? Just a few moments please. I appreciate your patience. Yeah, I have another question ma'am. Now I have another question. Yes, go right ahead. So, uh, do you have an, uh, do you do, do will you do the service in Wallingford as well or is only in Orange I can check the address after we finish this one. I can check the address for you. OK. Mhm. OK, sure. Thank you. Uh, yeah, one minute, one minute diaper and a diaper. Hold on, hold on. Thank for that hold on. OK, so the next, so I would suggest that we have this installed on Wednesday so that when this is not going to affect anybody else's account, so I would go ahead and have this installed on Wednesday so that you can go ahead and have your services working. Yeah. OK. Oh Can, can, can you make Can you, can you make it on Thursday? Is it possible? So we are coming there for, uh, coming on, uh, Thursday because some other people also coming for, uh yeah, so some of the service also is coming on the same day, so on I would suggest the 30th. I would suggest the 30th so you have your network running for those other things that are coming in like if you are having your cameras connected, your POS service connected, then they need the Internet service working already under your services. So it is Wednesday, 30th, right? Uh, that is what I would, yes, that is what I would suggest, because the thing is, is that a lot of the devices that you may be having connected on Thursday, they may very well need the internet to be working and if our technician gets there a little bit later, you are going to have them sitting there waiting to connect to the internet and. OK. Mhm. You know, Got you. Yeah. OK, so Wednesday what time, ma'am? I could do an X to XX and XX to X. What time frame works best for you? Uh, like, uh, uh, one o'clock or something. Well, it is either an X to XX, that means they can get there at any time between X to XX or they can get there XX to X. They will call you about XX minutes before arrival, so you tell me. XX. OK, XX to X is OK uh we will not be available to And they are going to call your husband. Yeah, but we will not be available till 12:30. That is a problem. OK, so what if I give you a X to X, does that help, does that, is that better for you? X to X is OK then uh we we need to stay there for X hours I do not know what time they will be coming. It is a X hour window anyway you look at it, but if you can not make it there until 12:30 and the technician arrives at 11:30, then you are going to miss the appointment. Yeah. So what I can suggest is tomorrow if you tell me do the X to X, tomorrow you can call in and speak to customer service and see if they can give you a better window because once this patch puts your order in. OK Tomorrow it will go ahead and say, OK, the technician is slated to arrive between X and X or 3:30 and 4:30. You can call tomorrow and then that way you can make your way there, but usually appointments are X to X, but we cut it down to X hour windows. Do you prefer the XX to X or X to X? Mhm. Yeah, uh, I will go with XX to X. OK, and tomorrow you can call in the morning, like let us say XX or you know maybe around XX o'clock and see if we could give you a better time spot, OK? OK, tomorrow, to which number should I call ma'am? Yeah Um, my apologies, not tomorrow, Wednesday, my apologies. Yeah, OK. The number is XXX. Mhm. XXX Mhm. XXXX, that is the same phone number you are going to call once you are installed to set up your username and password so you have access to the online web portal, OK? OK. Mhm. So that way you can see your features online you can set up your voicemail, you can set up your roll over that kind of thing, OK? OK. So you have to call that number anyway after you are installed, so it is a good thing that you have it right now. OK. Mhm. Let me give you your account number. OK. Let me just go ahead and confirm all the information. Remember they are going to call that XXXX phone number before they get there, OK? Mhm. So right now what we are doing is that we are scheduling an appointment for XXX Boston Post Road in Orange, Connecticut. OK. The technician is going to call about XX minutes prior to arrival on the XX to X time frame. The installation has been credited $99.99 so you will see a penny for your installation. Your monthly rate will be that $200 and your estimated taxes would be $10.84. This is going to include your gig speed of service, your modem, your router, premier technical support at the XX, your, um, connection fail over at the XX, your two phone numbers, and that is going to be for 4:30, XX between the hours of XX to X.

I could tell you what that would be with autopay as well, correct, sir?"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""So get a half a gig you would be at $105 a month, sir, with autopay.

Cause I only I do not I think."" [Agent] ""Um, it is we could save you money depending on what you are paying your current provider, but if you were to go with like an optimum unlimited plan, your business account, which is $115 that would come down by $45 a month."" [Customer] ""Um"" [Agent] ""So you can actually save $40. I am sorry you can actually save $40 I said $45 you can actually save $40 a month by switching over to the mobile So once you enroll in mobile, you save $40 on this account our mobile is only $45 So right now we have a deal where if you bring in two lines, we are offering two lines for $45 a month for unlimited talk and text, and then you would save $40 on your business account and you do not have to choose that option now but it is a savings and it is something that you would be, you know, entitled to, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK OK, I, I, I am sorry. I just do not want to get in. I guess let us see if I, I am trying to get a mobile."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Phone, let us say when, how much do I, uh then what, how is going to have my, my bill"" [Agent] ""So you can bring your, so you can bring your current mobile, so you do not have to buy a phone from us. You can bring a mobile phone you already have you can purchase a mobile phone through your EIN I could have somebody come for you, uh, tomorrow if you would like"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I could do X to XX or X to X."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK, but I have to buy a phone then."" [Agent] ""No, this is for the business the internet and the uh the phone not the mobile This is for the internet and the yeah, what time would you prefer"" [Customer] ""Oh yeah. I, I, I, I, I have, I have like a cell phone in my, in the business because if I, like I want to know if what how it is going to help me my bill like instead of paying XXX."" [Agent] ""So yeah, so if you, who is your who is your cell phone provider now? Is it Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile?"" [Customer] ""No, T-Mobile. I have my my T-Mobile."" [Agent] ""OK, so it is OK, so that is fine, but if you were to switch your cell phone service and link it to your business account, you could save $40."" [Customer] ""No, we do not have a phone in the business. In the business we only need the net. We do not have no phone at all."" [Agent] ""So the $115 would come down by $40 and be, does does that make sense? Um, so you could expense it through your business, yeah, and you can bring your current phone that you have if you do not want to purchase the phone."" [Customer] ""Yeah, uh-huh."" [Agent] ""So instead of paying T-Mobile, you would actually pay Optimum you would pay Optimum Mobile. We would be your mobile provider and it would be unlimited talk and text."" [Customer] ""Oh."" [Agent] ""You get unlimited calls to anywhere in the US, Canada for $45 a month."" [Customer] ""And I can use money."" [Agent] ""Yes, you."" [Customer] ""Can I use my number the same number?"" [Agent] ""Same number, same phone, yes, and then your business account would come down to $75 a month. I am sorry, I said $40 a month. Uh, yes, so you would be saving $40 a month because you have the X gig, so you would be saving $40."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""I just want to make sure I am telling you the correct savings. OK."" [Customer] ""No thank you."" [Agent] ""No worries. And then even if you do not add the mobile now, you can add it at any time and still get the same discount for the business I could come tomorrow X to XX or X to X, sir."" [Customer] ""Um, XX."" [Agent] ""OK, let me try to secure that for you because it is literally the last uh appointment that we have tomorrow. During that time frame, OK, so bear with me one second and let me go back because it has the mobile discount we are losing the mobile, I mean the uh the auto pay, you are going to do yourself you are going to enroll your own self in autopay.""

OK, so when is busiest, how many devices are going to be connected to the Internet Wi Fi and hardwire?"" [Customer] ""Um. be about. XX devices overall. Um, we do not need uh a really high level package where we are setting this up as a secondary, uh, internet service as a backup."" [Agent] ""OK. OK, terrific. Alright, so we are going to need a four digit access code on the account as well, uh, so but it can not be like XXXX or anything like that, but something to remember."" [Customer] ""Uh, XXXX."" [Agent] ""OK. Alright, so now your phone service is everything do you have phones set up already or"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, everything's already set up, um, you know, the phones are Internet-based phones, um, the primary services with Verizon, but you know, they service went out yesterday and we had no backup set up for the business so we are looking to get that set up."" [Agent] ""OK perfect. Got you. Right Yeah."" [Customer] ""uh, looks like, um, it says all piece on the box but that that is optimum as well, I believe, uh, is already wired into the building."" [Agent] ""Yes. Yeah, so, yeah, so it was definitely um service there previously. So what we are going to do, especially since you have connectivity issues, we rolled out a new device this year that, uh, it is an emergency connection backup. So even if that internet goes out, this internet will have a backup as well. Um, so like, um, there is, uh, uh, someone hits a pole over there. Are you, were you more near sunrise or?"" [Customer] ""Take care of Um, we are."" [Agent] ""Or is that down?"" [Customer] ""Maybe about a mile or two north of Sunrise."" [Agent] ""Uh OK.""

[Agent] ""I, I, because I am more out East Suffolk County, so I always get confusing where they start and stop them. I knew when I hit the mall which is now gone That is massape, you know what I mean."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""I start hitting lights on Sunrise."" [Customer] ""Yeah"" [Agent] ""I am getting close. Alright, so phones are taken care of, so we will get you set with that if it put in the back up. Alright, so what I am going to do. Pricing and everything, um, work out the best pro I can and I will be right back with you if for some reason we get disconnected I will call you back. Oh, Chris so"" [Customer] ""Yep, still here."" [Agent] ""OK, alright, terrific alright so. So I know we are running as a backup. So basically I, I left out off the phones or anything like that, you know the stuff we are not going to need So we have to gig into that with the emergency connection back or back up with the tech support for being a product protection. It is XXX a month goes down to X I am sorry XXX goes down to XXX a month when you do the auto pay"" [Customer] ""Mhm"" [Agent] ""Now, are is a day of install is it best for the technician to call you?"" [Customer] ""Um, yeah, that, that would be fine."" [Agent] ""OK, just want to make sure and is this number to the XXXX, is that the best number?"" [Customer] ""Yes, correct."" [Agent] ""Alright, so we will get that then we will get a date we will get you all set up here"" [Customer] ""Alright, um, what kind of, uh, internet package was it going to be and what was the cost on it?"" [Agent] ""Alright, so this is one, the one gig because if you, if you are going to have that many, uh, you are going to have that many devices you need to gig. So it is the X gig with the emergency connection backup, which is the whole reason we get this with the tech support and product protection and it is XXXX and it will go down to XXX once you do the auto pay. No contracts or anything, same thing, you know, no contracts without them. So uh, you know, you want to switch over, you want to get a second connection or anything like that, you could upgrade it to that any time."" [Customer] ""Mhm So we, we, we could not, we could not use uh a lower um internet package, you know, just, just because it is only going to be an emergency backup basis."" [Agent] ""And I am guessing you. Well, of course I mean you could. I just do not know if it would what it would really power you know unless we had a. Right, because you said you have a fair amount of devices they are going to be connected, right? So even as a backup, you know, if we go any lower, I would not hate to see you sacrifice the service what I would suggest there is a money back guarantee for XX days Try it out for a couple months. If you find out you do not use it, then it is probably best then you could downgrade."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I mean we really do not anticipate using it, but if, uh, it is more just for, you know, if an emergency happens like yesterday."" [Agent] ""Exactly, that is what I am saying you had that just yesterday, so."" [Customer] ""Alright, alright, uh, we, we can change the plan at any time."" [Agent] ""Exactly, there is no, no contracts. This price is good for X years as well."" [Customer] ""OK, alright, no problem.""

[Agent] ""The bill is $165 goes down to $160 with the auto pay, no contract right now we are putting in for the 6th of May, which is a Tuesday. XX to X is the window, about a half an hour before the tech's going to call XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Customer] ""Got you.""

The money to to me or at the door. And the pricing structure is going to remain the same you actually you are going to get a much faster speed You are going to get a gig speed of service at this time. We no longer carry the um XXX speed that you were under. So basically we bump you up to the gig speed of service. It will be a X year promotion without any contracts or cancellation charges. This bundle is going to include, of course, your modem, your router, the phone number. Um, it is going to include your premier technical support, of course, and your fail over service. So just sit tight for me a couple of seconds and I will advise how quickly we can get somebody out there for you. If you need any assistance with networking past the demarcation point, you let us know. Trouble calls are included within our premier technical support on the bundles that we are creating. And as far as the services, the technician's going to go into the location. He is going to, um, run the wiring to wherever you need the modem installed regardless of what was there. It happens to be in the same spot, the same telecommunications closet no problem, all fine and dandy"" [Customer] ""Uh hold on one second, he is calling me back. X 2nd, yeah. Hello?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, right here."" [Customer] ""Yeah, OK. Oh, OK, yeah. He is getting it for me."" [Agent] ""Not a problem at all. OK, so as I was saying, the technician's going to run the line to where the modem needs to be installed, including the modem, the router your connection backup fell over service So with that, in case the main internet for any reason is ever done, it will switch over automatically to the LTE network, so you will be able to connect your X most important devices to that, be it a credit card terminal, be it a, um, your camera or or the the computer that um sets up the. Uh, the appointments because you know you want to go ahead and make sure that you can continue to function until we get out there and resolve the issues. So let us take a look here, um, tomorrow between the hours of X to XX or XX to X, what would be the time frame that you need?"" [Customer] ""Um, Uh, let me just make sure what is in here. One second. Uh, I was too."" [Agent] ""XXX OK perfect thank you."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so everything's just getting revamped once again, no contract, no cancellation charges. Keep services here for as long as you would like extending the promotion because you are a valued long time customer to a X year promotion. Um, you can make modifications at any time. You can add services, new services. This is all, um, part of our standard of care right now I am just going to go ahead and submit the work order Let me just go ahead and. Give you the new account number because when you move, the account number stays with the address as opposed to the customer so there is an account number that is registered to Suite X. So if you want to go ahead and take note of the account number, that would be great. Once you are installed, yep, once you are installed at the new location, please call technical support."" [Customer] ""Yes, sir, please."" [Agent] ""And you are going to ask them to create your new username and password for the new account number that way you will have full access to all your features on the web portal. I am going to go ahead and request that they transfer the same phone number if for any reason they are unable to because it is out of area, whatever the case may be, you know, they will go ahead and assign a new one. I do not think that'll be the case because you are staying within the same town and zip code, so we should be OK, um you are good to go So right now we are scheduling an appointment for 4:30 between the hours of the XX to X. This is going to be $100 for your installation, monthly rate remaining the same at the $210. Estimated taxes are $5.94.

I know, I know, but in the city it is, it is better, but in my area, local area, it is a small town, it is not, not so good."" [Agent] ""You need to get them to put more towers up then, I guess."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, that is right."" [Agent] ""Alrighty then, so I mean just."" [Customer] ""If you could keep my number and and check, check up on it, but that is what my friends have been saying about the."" [Agent] ""No, I, I, I trust what what you are advising me. I am sorry that that is the case. Um, but once again, if it ever, you know, strikes your mind where you want to go ahead and maybe test it out, um, it is literally like $7 because you pay $47 for the unlimited line, but you get $40 off on the internet service."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So, you know, if that is a, if that is a way to go ahead and hopefully get some additional savings by all means, cause once you have just kind of like putting it out there um, once you have our Um, business services, give me just a couple of seconds. I just want to confirm because we have multi-product discounts, um, the $45 lines once you have X, once you have X lines goes down to $30 I think once you have X lines goes down to $25 Yep, $25 so $250 plus taxes, your bill for XX lines would be less than $300 basically because it would be about, it would be about $27.27 times XX, obviously $270 about $280 minus $40 you would be paying about $200 less than $250 overall because you know it would still be like the $280 on that but you get the $40 on the internet service, so definitely something to consider"" [Customer] ""Well, Mhm."" [Agent] ""Mhm mhm mm."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I have to uh Right now, like I said, I need the service that works, so right now T-Mobile seem to have the car, so unfortunately it is not an option."" [Agent] ""Understood. Understood. OK, so right now you are good to go on your installs, good to go on your disconnection. So at this point in time I just, um, were you able to get that tax ID by any chance?"" [Customer] ""Um, not yet."" [Agent] ""Alrighty then, so let me give you my email address. I do not want you to be too concerned because we will still be able to go ahead and do your installation."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Um, my email address is Sandra. Garcia. At Optimum.com. So S A N D R A G A R C I A at O P T I M U M dot com. OK, so when you have it, you could just go ahead and."" [Customer] ""Uh"" [Agent] ""Email me with the account number and say hey Sandra, the tax ID for how is that and I will go ahead and update it, you know, by the end of the day without any issues."" [Customer] ""No, I Is there an option to get like just one phone to get that down, or?"" [Agent] ""OK, your appointment is in the system for tomorrow between the hours of XX to X if you have any questions or concerns you want to go ahead and at least, you know, um, give the mobile service a try Um, you could always reach out to me via email I will be happy to be of assistance, OK Yeah, even with one line, you get that $40 discount. So that is why I first say, OK, it is $47 $40 discount on the internet service, your basic, your first line $7 Now if you had told me, oh I want two lines, I would say, OK, no problem, $60 for X $4 in taxes that is $64 minus $40 for the discount uh for having multi-product. I would say you can get two cell phones for less than $25. You tell me how many, how many you want, I will change my pitch right along with it."" [Customer] ""Right let me see, let me, let me, let, let me see what the Jack says I will get back to you"" [Agent] ""Yeah, not a problem. So you have my email sandra. Garcia@optimum.com.

It was truly a pleasure speaking to you and your appointment is good to go for tomorrow and then just bring the equipment over as I mentioned at the beginning of the call just to make it simpler for you that way you do not have to go to the payment center and return anything.""

Oh, I see, I see. Because a lot of the times people. Is that something I can set up Later?

Dash Enterprises. Dot com. You got it. Yeah, so that is contact at TSG-enterprises.com. Mhm. And that is the symbol dash too not the name dash Yeah, no, I, I got it. It is like uh A person uh that I was speaking to yesterday. She said that um somebody was telling her that her email. Uh I think I think she said dash oh period Does the person said that, you know, they they were spelling the word dash. What Or the work period something like that for the email. Yeah. I, I do not think that will work. Yeah OK, uh, pulling that up now here, uh, so. Sure, no problem. Sounds like you are driving. Yeah, there is Yeah, I am in I am in the car like multitasking uh. Of course. The EIN is XX. Uh huh OK. XXXX. OK. XXXX OK, just be careful, OK, you are driving, but just be careful. Oh no, I am parked right I am parked right I am parked right now yeah, I am, I am parked right now OK, good. Good yeah. So just to confirm that that is XXXXXXXXX. Yep. Mhm. Yep, you got it. Alright, and this is a gig market so. And services come with the phone. Uh, OK, so in your area. You said that you said the service comes with the phone. Yes, cancel the phone without on the number. Alright, uh, OK, so in your area we could do high speed internet, um, X gigs, X gigs, X gig, but if it is just going to be you and maybe a couple of employees, uh maybe X gig should be sufficient X gigs and X gigs, I think it will be overkill. Be too much. OK, OK. So XK will be perfect. Yeah, that Uh, and yeah, I mean, as you expand your business or get more employees, then you can always upgrade right now X gig is is more than enough OK, yeah, whatever you, whatever you think. You guys have BJs with Cosco over there, right? OK You do, of course they are all over. Uh You said you said we have what? BJ's or Costco? Oh yeah we got Costco, yeah. OK, so X gigs will be for like a taco. Oh yeah, hell no, no, we just need XX is good. Uh No, by the way, X gigs with the with the phone, uh, it is about $600 a month. Damn, that is crazy. Oh yeah, I mean, we do X gigs a lot. That is like XXX and change, almost XX gigs, but I, I never seen anybody with X gigs, not yet. I, I, and it is been out for like years maybe. So, so So the question, how much is this going to run this for just X gig because I, I only pay like $100 for my, my home service. Alright, residential, right, but residential commercial two totally different entities. Remember that residential is always going to be cheaper, always, no matter what. Uh-huh. But I will, I will tell you in a minute. Just do me a favor. Just give me a X digit access code for the account and a PIN, phone numbers you remember the time, a pin. XXXX. James Bond got you. Yeah I hope he lets it take it yeah, it did. Alright, cool bean. Alright, hold on, let us see. Yeah, well, yeah, XXXXXX digits, right? Yeah, mhm, yep, got it, absolutely, absolutely, just give me a moment because this thing sometimes um. OK. Sometimes it takes it, sometimes it does not. I do, I do have a question for you. Was that beeping on over there? Sure. That is me. I am sorry this is my, my, my, my, my phone for the Oh, OK, OK, no For one device that I have. I know you good. I just want to make sure nothing. I will make sure nothing in my truck was beeping. I am like what is this beeping, but uh OK uh quick question for you No, it is, it is, it is something like that, yeah, uh. Um, so I have, I have two phone services like I have this line that I am talking to now, and I got X other, I got two other business lines on the line that I on the package that I have for this phone, mobile phone, but two of the lines, not this line, but the other two lines are business lines like I literally use it for my business my both of my businesses got XX uh for each business. Uh-huh. OK. Right. My question would be, uh, is it a possible option to transfer, uh. My personal line or these lines that I have that I use for my business over to the business line. To the one that we are going to put on on this location. A business account? Yeah. OK, is it a local number? Is it the same area code or similar to Eureka? Or no? You got to think of that. Yeah, it is, it is, yeah it is it is the, it is the same service it is through Optimum Mobile. OK, so, alright, so you want to, uh, so it is an optimal move that you want to bring to a landline at the office. No, no, not a landline. I want to I want to have a, a, a cell phone line, but under the business name, yeah, but under the business line Uh, another cell phone. OK, OK, yeah, that is fine. And, right, no, that is fine, and, and the good thing is that if you do that, uh, they are going to give you a $40 discount on this account, um, uh, uh, $40 discount, yes, OK, which is great. OK. So that is, that is what ran and that is for transferring, right? I do not, I do not want to start a whole new one. I just want to transfer the line I already have for the business I just want to transfer under my under this business name Right, but OK, so, uh, let me get this straight because I do not want to tell you something is not there. Do you want to get a new cell phone with the same number that you have right now? Yes or no? No, no, no, no, I already, I already have a cell phone with you guys already yeah, I got, I got X cell phones OK. Right, right, without optimum. I got X cell phones, yeah, with Optum, yep, I have X cell phones, right, but X of them, X of them I own, I use for business. Cool, cool right now. So I am wondering instead of it being in my personal name and I am paying like on the personal account, can I just bring those lines over to this account that I am setting up with you guys with the internet and just have the business lines. Right. You, you, right, OK, you, that is fine, but the only thing is that if in order for you to do that, you would need to get, um, to bring the numbers over. Um, I will find out in a minute. Yeah. Give me a second because I, I never have done that, um. OK. Yeah, because this is going to be a landline with the internet, um, but if you want to bring those cell phones, the, the, the bottom line is you want to change those cell phones from your personal name to a business account, to a business name, period. Mhm. Yes, yes, correct, yes, correct. Right, so yeah, right, so that might be a change of name, but I do not know who would do that. I am going to ask, I, I am going to ask, I have a team that handles our cell phones. I am going to ask them right now. Hold on. OK. Mm. Hold on, let me see. Where's the telephone? What Oh, OK. Let me, OK, uh, how Uh, say hi for us. I am sorry that I am keeping you. All good, all good, as long as we get this set up the right way and get it going, that is that is the main thing. And And you said X lines, right? You have X phone numbers in your name? Yes. And they are all, they all optimum, all three of them. Yep, all three of them are optimal, yep, they are on a package together. They all are on the, uh, account together. Shut up. OK, let us say what they say right. Meanwhile, let us continue. hold on a moment. Alright no IP address. Now are you going to have TV service there for you for those late afternoons when you are working at the office for traffic and weather basic? XX, no, no TV. I, I, I barely watch TV. I would get distracted. I will not get nothing done with TV. Uh Oh my God. You would be surprised though how many people have TVs on on the waiting room or the the lobby or the um. Well yeah the waiting room yeah, yeah, this, this is, this is the office strictly just a work office there is no there is no waiting room Yeah. Just workstations. Oh I got you. OK. Mm That is nice. Hey, it is, it is OK if you, uh, if you take a little second. I am going to I am going to walk into the bank and grab some cash out real quick so I am going to I am going to OK, just, just, just, just, just leave so for everybody else, OK? Uh.

What do you call that where they make all the money uh right there in California so they can use it all. Yeah. Yeah. Um, you said you want this installed as soon as possible, right?

I need to probably follow up and like, what is what is right, right. OK, awesome. Thank you. Alright, got you. It is green. Right. Yes, sir.

Alright, give me one moment, I will be right back, OK, it is giving me an error. Hold on one second, OK? Alright Great. Um, first available appointment I have. Excuse me, unfortunately it is only May 1st.

Uh, X to XX in the morning, is that OK with you? OK. What what is what is the time? X to XX in the morning. X to XX, yeah, that'll.

OK, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, yeah, XX XXX. XXX, XXX-XXXX. Yeah, I lost you for a minute. Yeah, correct. XXXXXX. XXXX. It is cell phone. Mr. Green. OK. Alright sir, so we are going to go out there then May 1st between X and XX. We will set up high speed internet XGB to mode on the router. This also comes with basic protection plan with something goes wrong with it to fix it for free for a value of $30 which is part of the service with a battery backup just in case the network goes down, the battery backup will kick in and one phone number unlimited calling all together it is going to be only XXX. And the is going to be free as a one time courtesy installation charge and also you are going to get a $200 Visa gift card after XX days of service as long as you do not disconnect the phone, I mean that you do not downgrade the internet disconnect the account or fall behind the new payments, you will get those $200. You got it. OK, yeah, I got, and I have, I have another question here, so all of that sounds great, so you said it comes with a line. Alright. Sure. What what does that mean? That means that you have dial to and phone number. It comes with a landline. Yes, that means you have dial to and phone number. You could connect uh a fax machine. You can connect a regular landline, a regular phone, uh, you can use it as a private line so they do not bother you and things like that. Mhm. Or you can phone calls from your main office to that number if in case no one is at the main office so you can pick up the phone and answer those calls. Right. Uh, again you can use a fax machine and everything else. Uh-huh. It is a regular landline. And the good thing is there is unlimited calling in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Alaska, Hawaii, the Virgin Islands, unlimited. OK, and then I can set up, uh, so I have a a uh a X-XXX number if I wanted to forward the X-XXX number to that phone, that would, that would be good, huh? You can do that too, yep, mhm, yep, so this office, whoever calls the toll free, they will reach you. OK, I can do that. OK, yeah, yeah, OK. Alright Right, right, OK, alright, um, so that all of that sounds great. Let us lock it in and then I will pay in XX days. You send me a bill, OK, oh that is great, um. Yeah, you are going to get a bill, uh-huh, mhm. OK, so that now we got that squared away that is awesome that is perfect that is exactly what I needed, uh, let us lock and load with that and then the second thing that I was trying to figure out is, OK, so I am paying for my cell phones, uh, all together for the three lines I am paying I think $100 I think it is like $110 or something like that. OK. If we were, did you get the answer about switching over those lines? Yes, yes, yes, yes, and unfortunately they say at this time you can not. OK. OK, so in order for me to do that I will have to start a whole new service Yeah, X new X new phone numbers, X new phone numbers. With the business line in order to get the business line. Oh, and then I have to change the phone numbers too. Well yeah, so right, right, because they at this time they can not, they can not pull the numbers from. I guess up to to according to what she said um hold on one second, let me read to you what she said exactly. Uh, uh, these are the people that handles the phone with us because I asked, I said Hi, good day I have a question. So has X cell phone numbers with Optimum as a package deal, so we like to convert them to business instead. we could just change the name for his personal name to a business name she answered, uh, personal phones with Optimum accounts can not be converted to business at this time The customer will have to open uh an entirely new business to business account using his business tax ID. And the existing up to mobile numbers will not be eligible to be converted over to that new account. Then I said, uh, can we keep the same numbers on each phone? Dang. She said no. I said, OK, um. OK. And then she said if he wants to have a business account, yes, he will have to uh he would be new numbers because we can not convert uh residential numbers to business number at this time. And I said OK great thanks. OK, is there any Is there any pricing on that? Uh huh. Is it what what is the pricing on your business lines? Uh. Sure, I will give you that right now. Uh remember with business also you will get that $40 discount remember on on this account. Uh-huh. So instead of XXX it would be XXX. Right, right. Uh, give me a moment. Where's my thing for the phones? But I am not, I am not, yeah, and I am the main thing I am concerned about is that I have business cards printed with that with that number in already, so like. Mm Oh, OK. And then you know, so it is just like and I have that number for a few different accounts and stuff so it is like I was trying to keep that number because I am already doing business with that number and um. Right. Right, right. Yeah, so it just it does not make a lot of sense for me to. To switch that over if I can not get the number. Well, So let, let us say you want to go, who, if you do not mind me asking, who has the numbers, the cell phones, employees or family members or all I am sure you do not carry all three in your pocket, but anyway. No, no, no, no, I keep one at the office which I use for customer for my clients that they can text or, you know, new, new, uh, prospects for them to text, and, uh, the other one is the other one is for my food business, so it is a completely different business and that stays with the bus with the business equipment and stuff and when when the employees use that. Right, and the other two. Right. OK, oK, OK, OK. Right. Um, and, and yeah, so. Yeah, and, and all of those numbers are already like the 3rd X is my personal line. And the 3rd X? OK, alright, well, the reason I ask you is because we have different in business we have different packages of phones. OK, uh, some of them have high speed internet and some of them have lower speed internet. OK, is the, the amount of internet they can use. For example, we have the unlimited max, which is $55 a month, OK, but that one has, um, uh, let me read it to you, that one has, uh, XX gigabytes of premium data. Mhm. That is a lot of data, a lot, XX gigabytes, man. XG access included XG network, unlimited talk and text and XX gigabytes of mobile hotspot, which is still a lot too. And uh HD video streaming, that is $55 a month, but if we do X lines, it goes down to $40 a month instead of being $150 you would pay $120. You see what I mean? Mm, right, so I am so it is like the same price that I am paying right now. OK. So yes, I would, I would, I would be on board right now to to hop on if it was not for the for the numbers that is the thing that is kind of holding me up because I am like, yeah because it is like I have to keep changing the numbers everywhere and then people uh think that that is the number and they try to call and it is like, you know what I mean so it is just. The numbers, yeah, I, I, I know. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, I get it. I am not trying to confuse people or like block block any block any sales from coming in. No, no, of course. Yeah, of course, of course. Yeah. I mean, I wish you would have called us before you did that, but um. The the other thing I can think of is uh convert us to a landline and then come to Optim. I am, I am sorry say again That I said the only thing I can think of is convert those to a landline and then bring them to a cell phone. But that is going to take a. Convert them to a landline and then bring them to a to a cell phone? Yeah. Convert them to back to cell phone without them. You could do that? You can, you can convert cell phones to landlines, of course, absolutely. So, so if I convert it when my line to a, a landline and then I will be able to convert it back to a business line of a cell phone? So basically a cell phone, yeah, after, yeah, after you convert it to a landline. Is that what you are saying? But that means that you have to pay an installation to. You know, install them at the office or whatever you want install. Yeah, so it will be like a process. Yes, it will be a bit lengthy, like maybe a month or less. And then I have to pay extra money to. Uh, but you, but it can be done, it is not a problem. So what Well, what about this landline that I am getting now? Could I convert the number the number that I already have on the cell phone to the landline that I am getting already? Is there a is there is there is there a local number here? It is a yeah it is a local number here, yeah, it is XXX number. OK, so if, if you want me, if you want me to take it over, I, I do not, I can not, sure, I just got to send you what is called an LOA, a letter authorization, so you can fill it out and send it back to us so we can convert the number from a cell phone to a landline. OK, and then let me ask you a question, once I switch it over to a landline. From the cell phone I can now switch that that landline over to a business line? Cell phone? Oh, you talking about, you talk about converting it again? Yeah, and a cell back into the cell phone but for business. Uh, I believe so. Could, could you confirm that for me? Hold on, yeah, that is what, that is all, yeah. If you, if you can convert uh. OK. Why, why you do that? I am just going to grab some coffee. Take, take your time. Go ahead, take it, take care, take care. Uh Yep. All right bye. OK, they are going to let me know because she is not sure yet. So we will just leave the appointment, you know for that day and then um I will I will come back to you with that answer OK. I will call you back, um, and then maybe we can figure, maybe we can figure out how we can move those three numbers and convert them to business. OK, oK. OK, yeah, that sounds, that sounds good, that sounds good. Yeah, uh, so Right, mhm, yeah, and then, uh. We will just rock with what we already have and then, uh, yeah. Hold on a moment.

[Agent] ""No, I, I like the ARK from your last name. It is nice. Alrighty then, um. So as far as the services are concerned, we can provide you TV service, internet service, phone service. You are going to have a healthy office, X people, that is a good amount. Talk to me about what you are going to be doing. I mean, besides trading, like, you know, basically, um, does everybody have a computer out there does that they are going to be working off of?"" [Customer] ""No, so only X people are X, only X people are going to be using the computer constantly."" [Agent] ""Did you? Mhm."" [Customer] ""I am sure other people are going to join the Wi Fi, but yeah, that is really what it is, and um, yeah, that is been more or less it is really, it is pretty simple, and I am only going to need internet services today."" [Agent] ""OK. OK, so Understood the way that our promotions work, it gives you a deeper discount, um, with double and triple play promotions. So if you are adding TV service kind of situation gives you a deeper discount, same thing with the dial tone. Did you need TV service for like a break room or waiting area, anything like that?"" [Customer] ""No, no, no, not really, not really."" [Agent] ""OK, not a problem. So we will go ahead and skip that. Um, it will go ahead and give you a dial tone so it gives you a deeper discount on the Internet service to help offset the phone number pricing structure. Now as far as the service, can you tell me please how long your lease is for this location?"" [Customer] ""It is for X years."" [Agent] ""Perfect, thank you so much. Now Optimum does not have any contracts or cancellation charges as far as the services are concerned. I am going to go ahead and give you a promotion for a X year promotion. Um, if you decide you hit the lotto you want to retire, you want to go ahead and disconnect services, not an issue at all Feel free to do so, return the equipment, no problem, no harm, no foul, but at least it gives you the promotion for, you know, for the long term that you are there. And also let us say you decide to extend your stay once the promotion ends you could always reach out to our coordinators and we will be able to go ahead and provide you pricing on that. OK, so let us go ahead and take a look. Mhm I am just adding codes here with all the necessary discounts right so. Just make sure this works out. OK perfect thank you. So as far as our services are concerned with their gig speed of service, keeping in mind the amount of devices that you are going to go ahead and um have at the location, it makes sense to do the gig. That is basically the industry standard nowadays so you will have potentially X people to people, you know, um, on the computers, everybody, you know, has their cell phone maybe a wireless printer, that kind of thing OK, so anywhere between about X to XX devices under normal circumstances is what the location will have as far as internet, uh, the installation would be $100 then the monthly rate Including your modem, your router, from your technical support, your connection failover service, and one phone number so that you can use it as a backup, as a fax number, and alarm, whatever the case may be."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""That is going to go ahead and be $180. Um, the taxes on this estimated $5."" [Customer] ""$180?"" [Agent] ""That would be with the gig speed of service, your modem, your router, and that is a X year promo on the service, so that locks in your price."" [Customer] ""Oh, that is expensive. That is more than I thought I was going to pay. I thought I was going to pay around like $80.90 dollars. That is, that is what my friend told me. That is how much you pay."" [Agent] ""I can definitely go ahead. I mean, as far as the services are concerned, um, you know, maybe your friend was considering his home when he was saying, oh, this is maybe what the pricing structure may go ahead and be, um, I, as much as I would love to go ahead and potentially match our residential rates, it is not something that I can go ahead and do if you would like for me to."" [Customer] ""Alright. What is the cheapest, what is the cheapest rate you can give me?"" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Like in general."" [Agent] ""Well, let us, let us go ahead and discuss that because the least expensive or the most cost effective way is not necessarily the, the, the slowest speed for the internet service. Because if I was to give you, let us say our most basic speed, it would only be a year promotion and you would end up paying more money at the regular price for the other X years on the pricing structure that I am giving you. So if cost is definitely something that we need to be mindful of, what I can go ahead do is that I can go ahead and bring this to a X year promotion as opposed to a X year promotion And do you feel like you would get use out of your phone number? I keep in mind that the price structure is minimal I want to go ahead and make sure that if you can"" [Customer] ""I do not need no I do not need a phone number I really do not need a phone number. That is not much of a business."" [Agent] ""Not a problem."" [Customer] ""That is all we do."" [Agent] ""That, that is not an issue at all.

I appreciate your patience while I make those quick modifications here. OK, so at this time, um, if I go ahead and move that to the X year, move it without the phone service, everything else remaining the same, of course, your modem router, your gig speed of service, um, with the modem router, the premier technical support, the pricing structure for the service, just a second, making sure I am not missing any codes here.

[Agent] ""Under $100. Let me go ahead and take a look because I do not want you to have to sacrifice on the speed and then have to call in and say the internet is too slow and then have to pay for additional services. Let me go ahead and bring in my supervisor just to see if there is anything else that I could go ahead and do."" [Customer] ""I"" [Agent] ""If you could just sit tight for me a couple of seconds, I would greatly appreciate it. Just going to go ahead and let him know kind of like why I am asking for any particular concessions letting him know that you had a particular idea on what the pricing structure might have been based on what your friend had advised you see if there is anything else that he can go ahead and do because with the size of the location, um, it would still be.""

[Customer] ""Uh, paperless is fine. Autopay is fine too. I, I can set up auto pay autopay."" [Agent] ""OK. So basically when I could go ahead and do aside from whatever my supervisor may potentially approve um we will go ahead and include a $5 discount for autopay and paperless when you sign up for it.

[Agent] ""Just sit take me a couple of seconds longer. He is sending me a code to use now I just have to make sure that it works. With The services."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""OK. OK, so as long as we can go ahead and get you up and running and installed by tomorrow, um, if that is in your calendar that it fits my supervisor will be able to do something because basically it is like it will count for April numbers if that means anything to you, so he is willing to go ahead and credit your installation."" [Customer] ""Uh"" [Agent] ""The price would go down to XXXXX. We would be able to install you tomorrow between the hours of either X to XX or XX to X.""

[Customer] ""So, what about if I want to keep the new number?"" [Agent] ""Then if you want to keep the new number you if you want to keep the new number you can, but the only way you can keep the new number is by keeping everything the way it is and you just change the name of the the name the owner's name from the other person's name to your name.""

[Agent] ""You, you have to fax it, yeah, but you can not email it."" [Customer] ""Um, It is all done by fax. Called the name change form. OK. Um, so what if, if I, if I Do not change it. For example, what is going to happen with the number, their number? What do you mean if if if you get a new account? Right. That number is just turned off for I think like X months so you can never get that number under your name. You can not get it in X months. You can not get any year you can not get it. Right, but what is going to happen with the number because if they want to reuse it later. If they want to reuse it later, they can reuse it later. OK. Um, they have X months to reactivate the number if if for instance the old business owner moves to a new location or whatever, they can reactivate that number within X months. And after X months, uh, it is either X months or X months. I am not sure. He said X months or X and after that it is lost. OK. What is that you buying in you, you are buying a you are taking over you are buying a business from somebody else Yeah. Right, you can, yeah, so yeah, that is always the, the question if you want to keep the same telephone number, you just take over the form. Everything stays the same. But if you want a new account we would have to uh set up a new account and give you a new telephone number. Mhm. No, I do not want any number. It is just that um. Um, I did not want them to lose the number because, uh, that was a concern for them. They already have another business and they have a new number. Um, I do not. Well, it is up to them because they they own that number for up to X months. Mhm. So if they call, uh, you know, if they call us and say hi I um. I want to reactivate that number. You, you know, we can activate the number in a new location. Um, as long as they do not move far, you know, it is where, where is the business now? What city? Bridgeport, Connecticut. OK, so yeah, if, if you open up a business in Connecticut area, it, it obviously if they if they move to New Jersey, they can not keep the same telephone number, you know, it is going to be the same area code and stuff like that. Mhm mhm. So it is in the same Connecticut area, Bridgeport, and they moved on the block or whatever they can, they can they can reactivate that telephone number and keep it. Mm.

[Customer] ""At Spartan Resto R E S T O dot com."" [Agent] ""FedEx Spartanresto.com."" [Customer] ""Yes sir."" [Agent] ""Alright, you are looking for the one gig service? When you say extended, are you looking for pro Wi Fi? Because they do not have, we do not have like you know, Wi Fi extended We do offer something called pro Wi Fi. What kind of business is this? What are you connecting?"" [Customer] ""Um, they will probably be X or X. People in the office there will be some television. At times there could be up to XX people. So I think maybe that was what it was pro Wi Fi that."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Did that have the extender in it?"" [Agent] ""Yes, it comes for Wi Fi comes with a with with a with it does come with a. Extender or access point, so to speak it is called an access point."" [Customer] ""OK, yes, yep."" [Agent] ""OK, bear me one second. I am going to put a package together for you. I will go, I will bring up the pricing we will, I will tell you what the scheduling looks like Hold on one moment, OK?"" [Customer] ""Thank you."" [Agent] ""You are welcome. If this calls are dropped, can I reach you back at the XXXXX-XXX-XXX-XXXX?"" [Customer] ""Yes, absolutely."" [Agent] ""Alright, alright, hold on one moment."" [Customer] ""Thank you."" [Agent] ""Thank you so much. Are you there, Mr. uh Mr. Cataldo?"" [Customer] ""Yes sir, I am."" [Agent] ""Alright, so I was actually able to build you a nice package here, OK? It is the cost for the X gig with the pro Wi Fi, right, will be 189.99 cents. It is XX month offer. No contract is required. All equipment is included. Services also include, um, um, fail over, backup failover, wireless failover in any event that the internet ever goes down you get up to X hours worth of, you know, of internet still that way you do not lose any business The installation is 159.99. There are no contractual obligations. It is a XX month fixed rate. This is with auto pay. If you do without auto pay, it is 194.99 cents, and your taxes are only $4.38. I have availability to do this for you as early as tomorrow. I have between X and XXXX and X or X and X. I also have Saturday and Monday."" [Customer] ""And that I thought I remember Danny telling me there was something that was like $99. This is almost doubled."" [Agent] ""for We do have a $99 offer, but that would be with minimum internet. Like if you wanted to do the pro Wi Fi with XXX megabytes, you are looking at $99 your internet strength would not be XGB Not with pro Wi Fi. Now if you, let us just say, let us just say if you wanted to do a gig, bare knuckles, like uh if you just wanted to do a X gig package with the internet, the modem, no pro Wi Fi or anything like that, then you could do that."" [Customer] ""So OK, and so can you just explain to me the difference?"" [Agent] ""The promotional offer will be $100 before tax. Sure, so the package that I am offering you includes everything, as I said, not just the modem and the gig service, strength of the internet that you are going to need for your office, right? It includes pro Wi Fi with the access point. It includes, um, fail over, you know, sometimes for big businesses like that, you know, people find value and they say, hey, the internet may went down, but we do not, we do not need to be down and waiting for it to come back up. That is where wireless failover kicks in, so you still get up to X hours worth of connection on your internet. That is included with the pro Wi Fi as well as protection and support through aurion. So that is the package that includes all that would be 189.99 if you just want to go with the X gig, right, which is still, you know, it is still going to work as far as the strength of it, but everything else I just mentioned as far as for Wi Fi access point fail over, none of those things are included with the services."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""You just have the one gig with the modem and the Wi Fi service, which, you know, you can still connect but it is not going to give you like the access points and things of that nature. It is just going to be able to connect what it connects which is still up to you know, XX to XX devices, things of that nature in your office"" [Customer] ""OK So I do not get the extender or the uh access points."" [Agent] ""No, it does not include that."" [Customer] ""That And so how On that particular, uh, one gig."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""The office XXXX square feet. What do you think the the modem."" [Agent] ""I would suggest you take you, I would take the pro Wi Fi. I would, I would definitely utilize that for XXXX square feet for sure, because although I, I could tell you that the gig will work, right? I could definitely tell you the gig will work with that amount of space. Let us just say XXXX square feet, right? What ends up happening is sometimes on the back end you end up having to make an appointment to get us to come back out there and install that anyway and then you are paying, you are not getting it acquisition pricing or the other option would be to get a secondary modem which you are not even going to get a discount on, they will charge you full price for a secondary modem."" [Customer] ""And what is that?"" [Agent] ""Second book a gig a second modem is like over $300 just for that second modem. I would say try it the way, yeah, I would say try it this way."" [Customer] ""And so real"" [Agent] ""It is just my suggestion as a consultant. I would try this way because this way it is going to you are going to get the most out of what we can give you for for office that size. I am pretty sure when you and Danny spoke he definitely give you correct pricing when it comes down to what a gig costs, but perhaps he was not taken into a fact that what you were asking for if he would have packaged that in, he should have quoted you with the price that I am quoting you right now. He probably just quoted you with the standard gig offer which you could see actually on our website which is going to say $100 for XX months."" [Customer] ""Um, And so if I If I start off with just the one gig."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""And find that it does not work."" [Agent] ""You can always upgrade."" [Customer] ""Then I lose that I can upgrade."" [Agent] ""Yeah, yeah, you can always upgrade, but the upgrade price it will not be the acquisition price and it would be, it will be a slighter higher slightly higher price point. In other words, let us just say if you were to start off with the gig and then you would inch your way into things like pro Wi Fi, so forth and so on, right? You end up having to bill us over $235 or something like that when you could add everything $189. here is another suggestion, you know, just so you are aware, we offer a XX day money back guarantee which means you could try it the way I am saying try it. Right, if for whatever reason you are not satisfied and cancel the services within within XX days, anything that builds you refunded."" [Customer] ""But then I would have to go through the whole reactivation to make it just a straight one gig."" [Agent] ""I mean you can always downgrade to just straight one gig if you feel like you do not need it and you know that that you are just removing the add-ons out of your your offer it is not going to increase your bill. If you say hey I do not think I need the pro Wi Fi then they will just take it out of your offer."" [Customer] ""Right, and then they come back and they grab the access."" [Agent] ""They take the access points. That is correct you know, mhm"" [Customer] ""OK, I, I think, um. I think I am going to go. With just the X gig like I said there is going to be just XX people in at any one time and they will all be up in the front."" [Agent] ""OK OK."" [Customer] ""Of the building and the it is a warehouse so the back space. is wide open."" [Agent] ""Not a problem, not a problem."" [Customer] ""So I, I, I, yeah, I, I, I appreciate everything you have said you know we are, we are not that big a business to kind of double our expenses right now I just have"" [Agent] ""Mhm. No worries, yeah, absolutely, that, you know, again, I make the suggestions based off, you know, I always try to ask the customer first before you start throwing pricing and what are you utilizing them for when you said access point, you know, immediately I am going to, I, I know what that comes with. So I, I also understand, you know, when opening up certain things you want to try to stay to a certain number. So absolutely we can go with the X gigs, you know, bare knuckles, which is $100 with that being said, what day works for you was tomorrow good for you?"" [Customer] ""Um, tomorrow it does work, yes."" [Agent] ""OK, bear with me one second."" [Customer] ""And I mean if somebody was around today if that could happen, I have people going there today to tear up carpets so if you get a cancellation. I can make that happen too."" [Agent] ""Uh, I will schedule for tomorrow then if I can get somebody out there today, you are calling early enough where I could see if we can get somebody out there today for you If we can, I will reach back out to you directly. Let us see what time works best for you, but uh right now I am going to have to put, you know right now I will put what is available is tomorrow and then I will make a request"" [Customer] ""Sure, yeah"" [Agent] ""Alright."" [Customer] ""Sure."" [Agent] ""So tomorrow I have between X and XXXX and X or X and X what time works best for you"" [Customer] ""Uh, X and XX."" [Agent] ""OK. So once again, the monthly rate will be $100 flat. There are no additional taxes and fees. There is a one-time install fee which is $100. It is billed to you. It is XX month offer. Everything else as far as a XX day money back guarantee, that is still all involved, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Alright. What is the, can we use the number that you gave me, um is the best number to call on our way"" [Customer] ""Yeah"" [Agent] ""The XXX-XXX-XXXX?"" [Customer] ""Yes sir."" [Agent] ""And what card did you want to put on file for the auto pay?"" [Customer] ""Um, It is a uh Uh, Visa card."" [Agent] ""OK, give me one second. Visa card and the card number?"" [Customer] ""XXXX."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""XXXX."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""XXX. XXXX."" [Agent] ""That is XXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX or am I missing a number?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, you are messing it. So it is XXXX. XXXX. XXX X."" [Agent] ""XXX X. Uh huh."" [Customer] ""XXXX."" [Agent] ""Perfect and the expiration date?"" [Customer] ""X of XX. And the authorization code is XXX."" [Agent] ""Is this also on the Spartan reservation? Is the card, is that the name on the card or is it a different name?"" [Customer] ""It is uh Fred Cataldo and but it says Spartan restoration underneath my name."" [Agent] ""OK, is it built to the same address?"" [Customer] ""This is my corporate Um, Um My boss I do not know where he has this thing billed"" [Agent] ""XXX Ke Keyland Court?"" [Customer] ""I think it is billed to a Comac address I am not sure Do you need that right now, or I mean it, it."" [Agent] ""Give me one second. Let me see if it takes a card with it. If it takes the card with it, then it is fine. If not, then we would have to put a different card on file. Or give me, I will, I will make the attempt, OK?"" [Customer] ""Thank you."" [Agent] ""You are welcome. Yep, it is OK. You are all set. Your access code for this, I know you are driving, is going to be XXXX, that is going to be your access security pin."" [Customer] ""Like OK, uh"" [Agent] ""And I will email you your account number. I will send the email to the Fred at spartanspartanresto.com.""

[Customer] ""Yeah, no, I, I am, I am pulling into my office now, so I will have a minute to, uh. To write"" [Agent] ""Alright, we are all set. Do you guys use mobile phone for your business?"" [Customer] ""Um, we already do yes, we have Verizon"" [Agent] ""You have Verizon. Are you on a contract of financing your device?"" [Customer] ""Uh, yes, we are.""

The monthly rate is going to be the $160 the estimated taxes $8.01 no contracts and no cancellation charges on this two year promotion for the service we are going to be requesting XXX-XXXX. XXX on your behalf, please make sure that you do not call them to cancel it. Do not call them to put it in a pending disconnection.

OK, just sit tight for me a couple of seconds. I will let you know just what the. Pre-qualification looks like. Just a moment please. OK. OK, so right now it says that the pre-qualification survey will be done sometime next week, but I will speak to my supervisor so that we could go ahead and move it up potentially to like this Friday or so so that they could check the whole work and ensure that the wiring is that is there the way that it should be, um, if for any reason they check and they see that additional work needs to be done, they will pause the installation they will go ahead and um. Send it out to the construction department and just try and they will fix what needs to be done and we will be able to reschedule but for the time being it seems that we have had service here before years ago so it should not be an issue for us to provide um service. My name is Sandra I am the only Sandra in the commercial sales department Can I ask you one final question before you let me go?"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Can you tell me what you are doing for cellular service please, which company you have for cell phones"" [Customer] ""T-Mobile"" [Agent] ""Yeah T-Mobile, that is a great answer. The reason why I say that it has to do with a couple of things. Optimum now offers Optimum Mobile. And we use T-Mobile towers in the area to go ahead and power your cellular service. So, you could switch over for a business line with Optimum as far as the pricing structure is concerned, you can have an unlimited line for $47 That includes unlimited talk, text, and data with XX gigs of premium data. The price for the phone itself is XX I am sorry, the price for the service itself is $47 $45 plus $2 in taxes, so $47. But when you have a gig speed of service like you do right now with the order that we are processing on the 5th, no, it is going to waste your time."" [Customer] ""I do not want to waste your time."" [Agent] ""You get $40 off on the internet service."" [Customer] ""That No, no, no, I, I try to tell you, um, we have like XX with T-Mobile, and then we have been with them for like X XXXX years. I do not remember we are paying like XXX for X lines, so I do not know"" [Agent] ""That is OK. That is actually not a bad deal at all. That is really not a bad deal."" [Customer] ""I know."" [Agent] ""When, when you get that amount of lines, $25 a line, so XX x X, that would be $175 plus the taxes."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So basically taxes X lines times X, that is an additional $14. That is $189. So let us say that it is $200 with us as well. You actually still save money because you get that extra $40 off on the internet service."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So just consider it even if it is just one line for the office, you know, for you to buy it for you guys to do deliveries and things, you might just want to test it out."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""$7 for a delivery guy's phone number is not a bad deal at all."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""You can go ahead and um use existing line an existing phone that you may have, so just something to consider."" [Customer] ""It OK."" [Agent] ""Would you like for me to go ahead and help you out with that at this time?"" [Customer] ""Not right now."" [Agent] ""OK, but if that ever changes, um, we would be happy to assist.""

Alright you guys have Internet. The one gig. Phone lines. So you guys have one. X you guys have X lines."" [Customer] ""So it out there. Alright, let me, I will just make it simple this question is, uh, do we pay for each line or does it come with a specific amount of lines?"" [Agent] ""You pay for each line."" [Customer] ""OK, so here is the thing. So I want to upgrade the phone service, so we got, um I do not know what you have available I, I was reading a little bit, but I do not understand it much. Um, I am looking to have our all our calls recorded. To my computer like to my account or something so we could just listen to them or however, is that possible?"" [Agent] ""To record."" [Customer] ""Uh, it is just like I, I saw it. It says I do not know, there is a different voice or I something service phone service that if I go on I could see my calls and listen to them."" [Agent] ""Let me check. Give me X 2nd. I do not show anything at the website that shows that it records your calls."" [Customer] ""Right, like there is nothing that actually records the conversations?"" [Agent] ""Correct."" [Customer] ""Really, I would, I would think."" [Agent] ""Great."" [Customer] ""Uh hold on one second."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""I thought Oh cool alright so."" [Agent] ""Mm."" [Customer] ""It says, uh, optimum business hosted voice and Optimum mobile do not automatically record or however, optimum Business hosted voice offers a call recording feature that can be used to record calls with the consent of all participants. O the also it is called data records which contains information about the calls or direction but not the actual audio recordings here is a better break may is it is it in New York state only one of the One of the uh parties has to know that the call is being recorded and it is not for anything specific it is just that we have to record it for business purposes."" [Agent] ""Understood."" [Customer] ""OK, so optimum business hosted voice offers a call recorded feature and allows subscribers to record calls. It is illegal. So no, it is fine. It says with the consent what may be illegal in some states, so New York is legal Um, So do you have information about pricing on the optimum? Business hosted voice."" [Agent] ""Yes, sir. So that one there, Andrew. So that so right now you just have the service you guys provide the equipment it is how you guys are set up right now with the business hosted voice um."" [Customer] ""Uh, you know We have a modem I guess like uh. That"" [Agent] ""That is not what I am talking about though."" [Customer] ""That are qualified OK."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so what I am, so right now we provide you guys with the service for the phone lines you guys have your own physical phones, so with the business, so with the business hosted voice that goes away you are going to use our physical phones and have our service"" [Customer] ""Yeah. OK, now we use the same phone numbers that we have now?"" [Agent] ""So Yes, we can convert those numbers that you have today over to the business house voice side, uh, so the way that works it will be $40 each line. So you have X. So it will be XX times X."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""All right, and then to install them. It would be $60 each, so it will be XX times X. I am sorry, XX times X."" [Customer] ""I can, can we, can we lower it to. X numbers XXX. Let us say X numbers. I am sorry, X."" [Agent] ""You want to just leave one out?"" [Customer] ""You know what, just leave them on now, so I, I wanted to know like if we have it, I understand that the cost to have it installed. And what would my um. It will be each month because if I feel like we are paying a lot of money for the internet service."" [Agent] ""That is something different. I would have to get you over to the right department to see if you guys qualify for you to as far as what I can handle with you, you will be paying $240 a month for the, for the business hosted voice"" [Customer] ""Uh, not a problem, not a problem."" [Agent] ""The installation will be a one-time charge of $360. Uh, though just to let you know the process of it, uh, there will be two work orders essentially set up for you. The first, the first one is a walk through technician will go out there. And, and just make sure and set up a blueprint on where the physical phones are going to be sitting at to make sure that you guys have the um the correct uh ports, lines and switches. For each phone to work. Um. And then, um, we will order the phones. Get them programmed and get them installed from start to finish this could take about a month."" [Customer] ""OK, alright, no problem. Alright, so can I, um, so is so. Is there any how how am I trying to say is that I just to know like what features it has and everything because I look I see that it does have the um. Uh, it offers a call recording feature, so is that something we just do ourselves manually or we have to pay extra for that?"" [Agent] ""Uh, no, that, that would come with the, uh, bells and whistles, so that, that, that will come with it."" [Customer] ""OK, and with those calls that we decide to record them, does it where does it store the data?"" [Agent] ""It is going to be a software that you guys download almost like an app."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""It will be on your it will be on your PC."" [Customer] ""Perfect. That is all I needed to know. That is perfect."" [Agent] ""Mhm"" [Customer] ""Uh, all details. uh, alright, so. I guess the first thing is we got to set up like a walk through before we even do anything else, right?"" [Agent] ""Right, well, now it is important to understand that when the guy goes out there, he, he, that is all typically he is going to do. He is not going to you know, you already know the pricing, so be $40 each line monthly to install $60 each line Right."" [Customer] ""Yes, yeah."" [Agent] ""OK, cool, so he is just going to go out there and be like, hey Andrew, I am I am with Optimum I just want to make sure that where you need these phones you have all the hardware that you need. And he will just go there and make sure everything's there just in case they have to order anything or or do any sort of construction or fabricating to get this done for you um and then he will order the equipment the equipment would actually be mailed out to you guys so you probably have it in a box and then once we go out there, they will do all the programming um and get that going for you and then."" [Customer] ""OK. OK."" [Agent] ""Let me see here. Make this change happen for you one second. So we can do all X."" [Customer] ""Is it do we have, do I have to commit to all X right now, or can I because I am, it, it, it, it all depends on. Uh, we need like at least XXX, Say X we need like. X would be uh would be perfect for right now."" [Agent] ""It will be best if, if you make that decision, um, or once you know 100% that that is what you want to do just to avoid, you know, the appointments and then fees and. The wait time, mhm."" [Customer] ""No, no, no, X would be good because we are only really using X right now, so X I will select which numbers we wanted to keep and then um No, because right now that is you know see one through the main line for like. When would I have to give you the exact number for that?"" [Agent] ""That is fine if you need to call us back you can call us back."" [Customer] ""Oh no, I want to get it started because I know it takes a month, so, um. If I could, I, I just we decide the amount after the guy does the walk through. Like when he is doing it, I got tell I so let us do X or whatever."" [Agent] ""Yeah, I mean there is no contracts on set in stone."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""But you know it, it just be it is just, it just be best for both parties, us and you to make sure nothing gets crossed or forgotten or misunderstood."" [Customer] ""I No, no, it is, it is fine."" [Agent] ""Can you give me"" [Customer] ""I got it. I just need, uh, I need to set it up, yeah."" [Agent] ""So X We will do X, OK. One second."" [Customer] ""X hours I got here at XX. Uh You are good though. You really, I, I, I can not, I can not, you look so relaxed, bro. I am like I am going to wait. Uh. And XX hours a Now, can I, can we set up the appointment?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, that is what I am doing now. I, it is, it is, uh, it is a little of a process bear with me."" [Customer] ""OK I Uh, all good."" [Agent] ""I am sorry, I should have told you that that is what I am doing now for you."" [Customer] ""Take your time though."" [Agent] ""Mm"" [Customer] ""Um, and what, what, and I could, um, when we are done, is it possible you can connect me to someone with Internet service or? Should I Go back onto the internet phone line."" [Agent] ""Yeah, you, you should probably call back I would wait until this because the the the system So like one quarter at a time type of situation. So you would call at a later date."" [Customer] ""Oh, I, I am not going to probably make any work order for the internet. I just wanted to see what um. Oh, I, I just wanted a clear explanation on the breakdown of the charges."" [Agent] ""OK, so we would need to do that with you first."" [Customer] ""What is that"" [Agent] ""Do the breakdown of the charges because when I set up this they are not going to be able to get into your account and give you like an accurate."" [Customer] ""Oh Do not worry about the inside. I will not talk."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""I do not need to talk about that today."" [Agent] ""OK, one second. Let us see, so we are going to just do X. Zip code for you guys XXXXX. Have your account number here. And then the only thing I can not see is going to be um. The uh tax ID so we will be asking for that too, just to let you know for the business."" [Customer] ""Well we have it. you do not you guys have it right?"" [Agent] ""We, we probably do for security purposes yeah, I do I can only see the last X though I needed in full."" [Customer] ""Alright, no problem."" [Agent] ""OK. And. Go you go New York. And if we have any questions about this order we can reach you guys at XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Customer] ""Uh, let me give you a different number."" [Agent] ""Alright, I am ready."" [Customer] ""XXX XXX XXX-X that is my direct cell connection so it would be a lot easier."" [Agent] ""Thank you Andrew, appreciate that."" [Customer] ""No, no problem."" [Agent] ""And then I have an email on file here. Let me get that."" [Customer] ""Yeah, well, I wanted to ask you another question real quick before we go."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""Um, So if we were to um. So we said we were going to put uh uh the phone service. Under a different business name. With a different, uh, are we able to like close the one completely and reopen one?"" [Agent] ""At the same address?"" [Customer] ""Yeah Like, I do not want to lose our service, but because we have there is two businesses really, but to us it really does not matter, but I am wondering if we could. Get it Under the other name and then once it is hooked up we could cancel the other service is that possible? Or is it uh Yeah, it is going to be different with these phones though."" [Agent] ""Right, it is going to be different. So, um, there is two different ways you can do this. The way you are explaining it, um, there, there is going to be downtime. Uh, you are going to, and then you will lose the actual telephone numbers that you currently have today because the new account will get new num."" [Customer] ""Right, forget about we do not, we do not need to do it. It is not even a problem. I just want to do it. I do not want no downtime."" [Agent] ""I got you, yeah you do not want to lose the numbers so the other way to do this is there is a form that you fill out to change the name"" [Customer] ""Right"" [Agent] ""And then there is no there is no loss of service and you will not lose the numbers."" [Customer] ""Alright, no problem, that is fine this is fine. Just leave it out."" [Agent] ""OK, so we continue on."" [Customer] ""But there is there is not going to be much down time when they come to just do the installation right? it just be however long it takes."" [Agent] ""Yeah, it will be however long it takes. Um, I, I, I, I could see maybe some downtime, but I mean it should not be too long."" [Customer] ""Oh, that is fine, that is, that is fine, that is fine."" [Agent] ""Yeah, just for obvious reasons, you know what I mean, switching things over testing stuff out."" [Customer] ""Oh no, no, I get that, yeah."" [Agent] ""But uh we try to we try to minimize that as much as possible. That is why we have the um."" [Customer] ""Yeah, no, that is fine.

The monthly rate if you bring your own phone over would be $45 monthly once again you get a $20 credit on your account with the Internet service So it is like you are paying $25 for the line as well you will have everything bundled with Optimum Once again you get the unlimited talk, text and data with us. You have the option of upgrading in the future if you wanted to once again you can bring your own phone And save $20 a month on your internet service, that is something you would like to try out? Oh, that is fine. No problem, keep in mind we can also keep your number, so you would keep your same cell phone number you would not lose that. OK. OK.

Do you need cable TV or just the Internet service?"" [Customer] ""Just the internet."" [Agent] ""Thank you and you do not need a fax line?"" [Customer] ""Unless, unless there is a better package with the phone, um."" [Agent] ""Well, our phone services can be also used as a fax line."" [Customer] ""Uh, yeah, if you could price the Internet only and then Internet phone."" [Agent] ""OK, no problem. Um, so it is a $20 difference if you add the phone as a new customer."" [Customer] ""So about the internet, how many people will be using the internet service? Um, at any given time, at most X, OK, and on a busiest day, how many devices will be connected to the Internet? Uh, X X are you going to have security cameras? No. OK, so I can actually get you a really good deal for the. Phone and internet together it will be X gig internet X year promotion, no contract with the motorma combo included with the one phone line and premier tech support at $145 a month with autopay or $5 more without the auto pay. And what was the, uh, deal with just the internet? Just the internet it is $20 less, so $145 or $125. OK um. And say for example if you were to add the the phone service later on once you already installed the Internet service, you will not qualify to get it under a new customer promotion so you will be paying $40 with the existing customer promotion. Alright, um, yeah, so let us do the XXX. OK, and would you be doing auto pay or no auto pay today? Uh, and what is the difference between. Those too. So the quote for the XXX is with the auto pay. If you do not want to do auto pay, it is XXX, but nothing is due today, so I am not taking a payment from you today, uh, since we are a prepaid company, once your services are installed, your bill is due X days after. OK. I I will only set up the auto pay because we have to have that on file. To give you the discount. Um Well, I would like to do autopay I do not have my card associated with that account yet That is fine. Whenever you do, uh whenever you do enroll in autopay, the system will automatically discount $5 each month So at this moment I will be able to sell you the services at $150. OK. OK. OK. Yeah We did come up with a new product. It is called the connection back up. Um, what this does is it connects to the nearest cell phone tower whenever you lose internet service due to an outage or any technical issues. It is only $30 a month, and we do offer a free install with it today. Is that something that I could interest you in today? Uh, no, thank you. OK, and what would you like your X digit PIN to be? XXXX XXXX thank you and how soon do you need your service installed? Uh, ASAP. OK. Almo down sir. And while I am waiting on the system to save your information, I do want to tell you that you could save $40 off your internet bill if you bundle with Optimum mobile cell phone services. Do you currently have a cell phone provider for your business? Uh, yes, T-Mobile. So we also use the T-Mobile cell phone tower. however, it is still our individual company it is still under Optimum mobile. Um, how many lines do you have? Well, it is, it is our family. So I have one. A family plan? XXXX. And then X iPads, so X phones and X iPads. OK, we can only sell it this well you can start the services with X lines to begin with and then um so it would be $45 for each, um. For each tablet and then for the X phone lines it would be XXX. And then you would get $40 off your internet bill every month. Is that something that I could interest you in today? Uh, not today, but I will look into it. OK, sounds good, sir. My first available for the install is the 8th, Thursday. I have between X and XX or X to X p.m. OK, yeah, let me see you said the date, um. The 8th, uh huh. And and what were the two windows again? X a.m. to XX or X to X? Uh the X to X, please. Alrighty thank you. Alright, so just to recap your order, I am scheduling you for the 8th between X and X. We are installing XGB internet with one phone line. Monthly rate is set at $150. It is going to be a X year promotion, no contract with motor motor combo included, and premium tech support I did waive the $100 installation fee for you Our technician will call you XX minutes before arriving on XXX-XXX-XXXX. Alright thank you so much. You are most welcome thank you for your business you have a wonderful day, sir You too.

OK, and is what is the suite number for that? I think it is X. OK, alright, it is OK if you do not have it right now when are you, um, when are you moving Well, the lease was supposed to be effective April 1st, but our landlord is a miserable person and has trouble holding on to staff, and so we do not even have the lease yet. Mhm. Um, I told him we are not paying any any $4000 a month rent. The place is way too big and it is not our fault he is dragging his feet, so. Mm. Soon I mean you know and and it is supposed to be retroactive to April 1st, so. OK, OK. Uh, hopefully in a week. OK, well I mean that that is fine. I just wanted to have an idea um let me just see here. OK, you have the back alright, yeah, so just allow me a few moments so I am just going to look into it and just see um what we would need um to have set up then I will just walk through the process with you so that you have an idea It does not matter if you are not certain on the day, uh, there is something I can, you know, work with you or even set up something tentative so it is not an issue, but let me get you the information you need and I will I will be right back OK. All right thank you. You are welcome. Now, as far as the um the space goes, the space is uh smaller than the space you are in now? Oh, much smaller mhm. OK, how much smaller would you say? 50%, 25%, 10%? I would say we have got maybe. A quarter of the space that we have here. Wow, OK, OK, um, and, and that would, would, you know, be that as it may. What kind of um what kind of business is this just so I understand what you are using the internet and stuff for. It is a law firm. OK, alright, so you are doing some uploading and downloading documentation things like that. Right. OK, alright, alright, so yeah, I am going to just put everything together, uh, miss you, I will be right back. OK. Thank you. You soon. Yes. The suite that you are moving to, uh, ma'am, can you tell me. Um, what business or what was in that suite before? It was I think it was called like high stakes roller or something um. That sounds exciting. Uh yeah, yeah, you know, they sold, um. OK, I see high stakes here. Like packages of, of, of cards like um collecting baseball cards and you know you pay an amount you probably ended up with mostly trash maybe there is a valuable card in there Oh, OK, I heard of that. Yeah, I never really got into that I know what you are talking, OK Uh, uh, It it it was that kind of thing, a lot of sports stuff. OK, OK, I see that. That is, that is really all I know about it high stakes something or other. Yeah, I see it here. I think it was high stake high stake breaks, so it is a little bit of everything that you said. Yeah Yeah, so that is exactly what I needed to do. Thank you so much. I will be right back. You are welcome. OK. OK, so I am almost finished here. I am just waiting for the dates and times to uh populate then I will be able to review everything with you OK. All right, the way things normally go, uh, we just ask that you bring, uh, the equipment from one space to the other space, and the tech will basically do the installation, uh, swap out or make any changes that need to be made, and, uh, basically, uh, set you up to be, uh, up and running, um, as far as, um, as I said, the timetable and everything, that is, you know, that is fine we will work on that. And um you will have a new account number so it is because it will be a new location but again as I said I will review everything uh with you it is pretty, pretty straightforward other than that. OK. OK. Alright, so And really the only thing we are taking then is our our phones that is really all that you would get involved in, right? Our computers would be our tech guy. Exactly, exactly. So we are going to be setting up your internet and your phones and uh whatever your tech um or your IT does, you know, you, you know, you will have them continue to handle that. Now, as far as your IT goes, um. Alright What do they normally do as because we set up everything so um do they do anything additional or are they on site or off site? Well, you know, like the, the, the scanner has to be programmed to the computers, whatever he does, there is some connection so that we can send our stuff to the scanner, um. OK. I guess the postage meter uses the internet to download postage. OK. So I do not know if he will get involved in that and then we have a fax machine that uses a phone line. Which is where you would come in I guess. Exactly, yeah, we, we provide that. So, OK, OK, so yeah, it is, it is pretty, pretty straightforward for, you know, law firms and things of that nature that uh we deal with. So, uh, pretty, pretty simple like I said, um, what I am going to recommend is, um, you know, whatever move, uh, date, um, we set or whatever it can be updated because I know that, um, you know, whatever's going on with your landlord dragging their feet it does not seem like, you know, it is you it just seems like it is set you know we will, we are able to make modifications if needed OK Alright, so yeah, again just going to bring everything up and I will, I will review the dates and times in a few moments. OK. Thank you ma'am. OK, so I wanted to confirm something here. um, can you tell me, uh, how many, uh, phone lines you have with us? Oh let me see now we have got XXXXXXXX X and X that is X. Then we have got XXXX that is X, and it looks like two brick lines. I do not I mean maybe they are forwarded from brick. Um OK, yeah, because I am showing on this side you have X with us just wanted to confirm. XXXXX. I have X. And then the fax, right? You can or you included the fax because that is usually the 8th X. XX no, X and X in the fax, yeah, that is right. OK, got it. Alright, just wanted to confirm, just wanted to make sure. Alright, so just um complete. Which, which we, we do not need that money. I mean we used to be X attorneys. And we are down to one, so we do not need that many lines. Mhm. OK, now. Right, so what I always recommend is that once you have your services, uh, installed in provision, then you make changes, you know I recommend no, you know I am setting up a move for you So if you want to take anything off or you want to change anything, uh, I would certainly recommend doing that once you, you know, once you have everything situated. OK, yeah, because I would say maybe we need our one and an overflow. And then there is this person who uses space. He has his own line in here, so that would be X maybe the brick line the fact, so X from X to X. Yeah, so I am again I am going to leave it as is because this is another thing too which is which really happens is, you know, you have X and you, you are certain you want to go to X, you may go to X, you may go to X so I recommend again you just have services installed because what I have seen is people eliminate one line too many and then they call back and they are going to charge you the price for that phone at that time and they are going to charge you to install it. So I always say, hey, just, you know, wait, you know, even if it is a day, even if it is a week, just wait till you have everything settled you make that determination because then you will not be, you know, paying for something again that you already would have had OK. Uh huh OK, so then after we are installed and settled, I could just say hey we, we can eliminate X lines we are not using them and. Yes ma'am, 100%. OK There is no contract or anything so you can make changes at any time. I just like I I have seen it so many times so many times. OK Alright, thank you. So again, like I said just just confirming those lines we are almost done. Uh Now Ms. Sue, um, thank you for holding. Uh, in regards to the, to the move, are you going to be on site, uh, for the move? Are you going to be present? Yes. OK awesome alright because I already have your contact information uh so as I said um it is just like um. I was describing, um, what you would do is you would bring the equipment over you or whomever, um. To the suite, uh, the tech is going to install and provision everything, uh, with regard to you um, we were able to Actually upgrade your speed um at the same price you are currently at so it is not uh no changes here um you are going to be at the one gig uh you are also going to get um it is also going to come with around the clock uh support there um with regard to the phone lines everything's going to come over the technical support is going to be for you to be able to call in it is also going to be able to. Uh, assist in replacing any devices, uh, and things of that nature, and they also answer in like, uh, XX seconds or less, um, with regard to, um, the set up and everything, as I said, um, you or someone just has to be present for the tech to set up everything they are going to take away anything they need to take over, um, take away and then as I said once the set up is complete, any changes that you want to make, I recommend um you do so at that time. Uh, as well, um, so you are going to be at, let me see, let me make sure I have the X phones XXX. OK, so I do have the X phones. You are going to be at $435 even uh there is a one time install of $100 again no contract, uh, there is no payment due today there is no payment due to the tech um, this is actually I think it is like $4 or so, uh, maybe a little more less than what you are paying before, um, and I am not sure if um. The office is on auto pay, but however you have been paying, just continue to do so um other than that, uh, as I said we are bringing the equipment over you, you really do not need to do anything, uh, you do not need to do anything else and if you are, you know, tech guy wants to be on site that is, you know, it is totally fine too other than that, like I said, we take care of everything. OK, so now you said 4:35. Plus a $100. Yes ma'am. fee of something. Right, there is a one time install uh for the tech, uh, the installation fee again, as I said, professional tech comes by installs everything, uh, takes away what they need to take away, uh, provisions, um, the phones and everything that you have set up and make sure that there is continuity there, um, with the uh. With the contact with the phones. Other than that, as I said, you do not need to do anything other than giving us a call to make whatever changes you want to make with the phones. OK, so 5:35. Is what we are looking at to get the funds moved over, OK. Yes ma'am. Right now I have um I know you do not um, you were not certain possibly on a date I have a Monday April 7th I could schedule for that and if you needed to make changes you could get back to me or we could, I want to set it out a little further. Oh no, that is Monday. um, I do not know are you thinking next week you thinking the week after What would you, what would you, how do you? Oh, I, I think, uh, I think the week after they originally said effective April 1st and they would give us the month of April to make the move but so I think they feel, you know, justified. Yeah. It sounds like they give themselves some time to So yes exactly they think they have built in some time for themselves so I am thinking maybe somewhere around the 18th X that is Good Friday we are not even here on Good Friday, um. Yeah. Yeah I was just looking at that. Um, so I am thinking maybe the 21st, so that is like two weeks from Monday tentatively. OK. Yeah, so the 21st, because we could, uh, the thing about it, um, this is I am going to email you. I am going to send you a test email in a few moments. So if you ever needed to make a change, like we are going to set it for now for the 21st for Monday I have XX to X I have X to X. The XX I am sorry what is this the XX. Monday the 21st I have XX to X I have X to X. Monday the X XX to X. OK, so XX to X it is, and what I am going to do is I am going to send you a test email to whatever email I could either send it to the one that is on the account you can provide me one directly to you Is that And do you have MWCD is that the one you have at up online.net? Go ahead. This No, this is Triple M WFC. Oh gosh, no, that was, you know, X lawyers ago it is it is uh let me update it. Mhm Please. M W C D At opt online.net. OK awesome so that is MWCD at optline.net. Yeah, my office mate wants to ask you something too about the move. OK, hold on a sec. OK, sure. OK Thank you for holding. We sincerely appreciate your patience. Please stay on the line and we will be back in a moment. Hi, um, this, uh, including like the wall jacks part of the installation cost. Hey When you say wool jacks, what do you mean specifically just so I make sure I am I am getting what you are saying So like Well, like, um, there is a, there is a desk going in a certain area there is nothing on that wall so I would think if we had a phone there would have to be unless you can just run wires up the ceiling and down the wall So what the tech does is they are going to set it up like um you know for your convenience for you to you know be able to do what you need to do with that said though, if it is something that is outside of what we do like we provide you with the phone service and we are going to make sure that you can, you know, plug your phones in and be ready to go, but if there is like something additional that is how that is kind of outside of it that you know it is kind of dependent but you know what you are describing it does not, you know, it does not sound like it is an issue. You know Well, what I mean like where, where you are going to plug the phone to if there is not some place for you on a particular wall that you can not plug the phone into, is that part of the place? Well, Well that is what I am saying they are going to set you up so that you are good and be able to utilize your phone so if it is something that they need to do or we need to do to facilitate that we will set that up now if there is something like, you know, additional that you know is is out of our purview like what you are describing does not sound like an issue sounds like you know you we we would be able to set you up so you would be good to go with the phones. But, um, you know, if it is, you know, anything major like they have to get on a seriously high ladder and put it somewhere, then that is not something they will be able to do. OK Oh gosh, no. No, no, no, no, I just wanted to, if you are saying like, you know, set up, you know you will be able to get us phone service and plug the phones in for us Yeah we will be yeah we will be able to set it up so you are good to go it is just, you know, they are not, you know, going to do. Like and that example is the most accurate. Like sometimes people have like a really high high place and they want us to set up something there and you know our ladders only go so high. No, it is just that right now on that wall there is nothing to plug the phone into, so I was just wondering if that if you provide that plug in. Yeah, so, yes, exactly, yes we do we are going to set it up so you are going to be able to just we call it plug and play. We are going to set it up so you are going to be able to plug in the phone and be ready to go. Oh, OK. Oh, OK, that is perfect. OK, that is what I wanted to know. OK, you apply anything else? No, that was it too. Did you need to talk to me again? So she said she will be in touch with you when we have a more definite. Well, I just have to, um, I just have to confirm, um, with Sue because I am going to set it for this tentative date I want to, um, you know, I need to make sure that she receives my email as well I just need to speak to her for about XX seconds. OK, hold on a sec, thanks for your help, hold on. OK. Tyrone. Hey this is, so yeah I just wanted to confirm I am going to send you, I am scheduling this for the 21st from XX to X. You are listed as my contact person and I am going to email you right now so that if you need to change the date you can send it back to me. OK Alright, so I am just going to confirm that the number I have for you is XXX-XXX-XXXX. Correct. OK awesome so as I said, just going to, you know, give you that upgrade, bring those phones uh over and everything. You got the protection and support. This is going to be for XXXX Highway XX Neptune, New Jersey XXXXX you are actually relocating um the same area you are just going to be locating to a different suite, um, so same address different suite Um, you are going to be at 4:35 even one time install of XXX bucks we are currently set for April 21st, which is a Monday from XX to X. If you need to make a change, uh, you will be emailing me back there is no payment due, uh, there is no payment due to the tech OK, very good.

[Agent] ""Got you. Alright, do you guys like have a new lease or anything like that for this location because they are going to want to verify that there is going to be a new person there that way you can turn it off because it outside of that we would have to. We have to speak to them so they could say we we are no longer there so it is not that we do not believe you they are just going to ask for proof that there is a new owner of this location. You do not need anything that is there already like you know the phone numbers or anything like that, right?"" [Customer] ""No, we do not need anything other than internet."" [Agent] ""Alright, give me one second, um."" [Customer] ""So give me X 2nd."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Mhm Mhm mhm mhm mhm. Mm"" [Customer] ""To get internet. And they are saying that it is still on in.

They are setting up, they are, they are, they are setting up two accounts. Are they one of them is already set up and the, the this one. It shows that there is an active account there, but it looks like the account is in collections. They are opening up an urgent care here. They are asking, you know, as far as proof, can they send over article of organization because I told them, you know, typically we take a lease, but they was like we do not have anything like that. We have nothing to do with the previous company that was there. If I give you the account number, could you do you mind taking a look at it?"" [Customer] ""Now that is going to have to be something they are going to have to take up with collections because I would not know on that one what they could send in and what they can not send in."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Got you. Do you mind taking a look at the account and seeing like."" [Customer] ""I do not mind."" [Agent] ""Sure, it is um XXXXX-XXXXXX customer number X. The account is still active, so that is why I did not think to call collection because they are not asking to collect although there is a major balance here."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""It is like $5000 over here."" [Customer] ""Mhm. XXXX."" [Agent] ""You know, so whoever was here bailed on it."" [Customer] ""And it is a new customer trying to move into this same spot?"" [Agent] ""So new customer, yeah, new customers moving into the suite XC. They, they, they are opening up urgent care."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""They just set up one account with me a second ago for um Branson Urgent Care at a different location, and they are looking to set up another one here."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I was like, you know."" [Customer] ""Not here. Because, um, You would have to disconnect this customer that is already here."" [Agent] ""Right."" [Customer] ""And we would not touch it with that $5000 balance. It would just have to be."" [Agent] ""So should I refer them to the collections team?"" [Customer] ""Yes, to see if collections could help them, um."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""It says uh the account notify. That does IT work for this company he is not responsible for the account balance To contact, uh, OK, yeah, collections might be able to contact that number or retention, uh, to see if they could resolve this, but I doubt they are going to pay."" [Agent] ""I do not think they are going to pay either. They probably just want to know what can they receive to prove that there is someone new there."" [Customer] ""Right, and so they could get to collections and collections."" [Agent] ""Give me one second, mm."" [Customer] ""I could probably help them with that."" [Agent] ""OK, give me one second."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Yep, perfect. I will just, just looking for the contact number for collection with teams."" [Customer] ""OK.""

They are actually setting up two, and in this second location that they are giving me, the account is still coming up as active with like a very big balance on it. It is not disconnected. It is not in collections or anything like that. When I spoke to our sales support team, they said, you know, you may need to reach out to collections to see what other form of information you guys would accept to kind of, I guess, assist them with setting up their business. They said that they have something called um Like a lot of organization. I told them typically you guys would need a lease but yeah."" [Customer] ""OK. Is there, is there, is there a hold at the address?"" [Agent] ""There is no hole in the address. It appears I could give you the account number if you want to take a look."" [Customer] ""So wait, wait, so we would not do anything with it if there is no hold our our department removes the non-serviceable holds on the addresses."" [Agent] ""OK, so how do, how would, how I am sorry, go ahead."" [Customer] ""So, is there No, if, if it is active, the account's active sales is supposed to call the active number and make sure that someone is still living there or if they still want the services, um, whatever their protocol is, I do not know their end of it."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""All I know is that sales usually disconnect services if they call and uh no one answers."" [Agent] ""OK. Uh so I, I normally, um, I was told that you know they need proof of like we need proof of a new provider before we just cancel somebody's account, you know, without mhm.""

[Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""OK, thank you for being patient."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So let us see here, so based off the information you have provided for me, I would suggest the one gig speed here. So that is our fastest speed in the area that would definitely accommodate all the devices that you currently have and give you room to grow in the future, you know, like a school academy type of place if you expand with more employees, more students, or just more people or devices at the location, the one gig will definitely handle it."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Uh, promotion also comes with one phone line."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I do not know if we had covered that or not, but it does come with one phone line. So technically you can use it for incoming outgoing calls, fax machine, alarm system. You can use it for any type of scenario. Would you need more than one phone line for the location?"" [Customer] ""Um, well, let me just, uh, um. Let me just uh give you a little background uh. Uh, Verizon was coming out to, um, hook up the phone. It is the type of phone, you know, you plugging the phone into it."" [Agent] ""Mhm, OK."" [Customer] ""So, um, Uh, they are going to hook up like about maybe like about um Let us see. I think they were going to hook up like X lines or something, jack phone jacks. But they charge too much."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""So, that is why I was calling to find out my other options you know"" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Because um Yeah, uh."" [Agent] ""And it was going to be X phone numbers or X phone number?"" [Customer] ""So, are you able to Well, I was going to have. Um, I guess I do not know, X different phone numbers, X different phone numbers, maybe just X."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Let us see, the place is not so big, so I mean."" [Agent] ""So I will give you the price with the one phone and then adding a second line."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""So with the internet and one phone line, monthly we would be XXX. If you add a second line. Monthly rate would be XXX. With adding a second line that is the internet now with two phone lines."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Same thing, no contracts with us like Verizon. We have no contracts. I believe they have a X year or X year contract, uh so I mean if you have to stop service for whatever reason There is no cancellation fee. There is no penalty disconnect fee, nothing. You would just give us a call and stop service no matter what the reason, and that is it. Uh, it is a one time install fee for the technician to come out and get the service set up for you guys. It is a one time install fee of $100 that would be on the first bill."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So second thing is, like, for example, we do place an order for you today and hold everything in place, um no payments are processed today, nothing is given to the technician during the install everything would be on the first bill"" [Customer] ""OK. OK. All right, um. Well, I, I purchased two phones for Verizon. They work on your line?"" [Agent] ""Are they standard phone jack phones or?"" [Customer] ""I I can use One of them is the other one is not, I do not know, I, yeah One of them is I think one of the other one is it."" [Agent] ""I can not"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""I can not speak for their equipment because I am not familiar with it, but if it is a standard phone jack, like just a standard phone jack that is been around forever, then yes, you should be able to use it, but once again I can not 100% speak for it. I I have not seen it or anything. Um, worst case scenario, you can always purchase any type of phone for our service."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So from Best Buy, Target, Walmart, wherever you go, you can easily pick up a phone. It is not something that you have to special order through Amazon or something like that."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Any type of standard phone or office phone will work with our system."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""When were you possibly looking to have this set up by?"" [Customer] ""Alright, so Um, as soon as I could."" [Agent] ""Let me take a quick look at something."" [Customer] ""So, Yeah."" [Agent] ""So we do have a spot for Wednesday between X a.m. and XX a.m. We also have Thursday X to XX or XX to X."" [Customer] ""Uh, yeah, I I am, I am out of school, uh, after X o'clock And I would have to check with the owner."" [Agent] ""So anything after X would be good for you?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, like like XX o'clock, you need time to get there, X o'clock."" [Agent] ""So Would anyone be able to be there just until let us say you would arrive or?"" [Customer] ""Mhm. Uh, yeah, um."" [Agent] ""Because we typically have X to X."" [Customer] ""The older you should be able to go to the X, OK."" [Agent] ""Yeah, let me see if I could get XX for you."" [Customer] ""Yeah, um, OK."" [Agent] ""What day would work for X to X, Wednesday or Thursday?"" [Customer] ""One is good."" [Agent] ""Wednesday would be good. Let me talk to my supervisor. Give me one second."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Let me see if we can get X to X for you."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Be right back."" [Customer] ""OK, thanks."" [Agent] ""You are welcome. OK, thank you for being patient. So yes, we could do uh Wednesday X to X."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Perfect"" [Customer] ""All right, and uh let me see if I can give you the EIN number. uh, I have it. OK, so. And I know. Yeah."" [Agent] ""Oh, and I am sorry, I said Wednesday, also Tuesday we could do tomorrow or Wednesday X to X, so whichever one you like."" [Customer] ""Uh, Wednesday would be better because I, I think I, um. Yeah, I will be coming out of school late tomorrow, so. Yeah, so Wednesday would be better for, uh here is the uh number"" [Agent] ""Perfect. So let us see. OK."" [Customer] ""XX-XXX XXXX"" [Agent] ""XXXX perfect thank you. Oh and also what four digit access code would you like to use for that account?"" [Customer] ""Actor code, um."" [Agent] ""Correct."" [Customer] ""Um, So, what would it be, what would that be for? like what would I?"" [Agent] ""So for example, let us say you, you call in you have someone call on your behalf, you can use either the last four digits of the tax ID number for security purposes when you are calling up for that account or the X digit access code So if you do not want to give someone the tax ID number like the last X, you can give them the access code and that is something you can always change on that account as well."" [Customer] ""All right, so I will do 10:46."" [Agent] ""10:46 OK perfect. And just to let you know also we have a backup system here at Optimum for Internet service through a cellular network that we offer. So for example if you have any outage in the area due to inclement weather, an issue with the utility pole, no matter what the scenario is, it would automatically kick your Internet over to a cellular backup to where you would never lose connection at the location. It will not be full speed like you are getting now at one gig because it is over cellular you would still be able to use your devices You would still be able to work and maintain your day to day flow at the office. We do offer that for $30 if that is something you want to try out monthly, same thing no contracts"" [Customer] ""Oh yeah. Uh, $30 a month."" [Agent] ""Correct and it is contract free you could take it off at any time."" [Customer] ""Mm. Mm. OK, I, I will wait for that because I, I, I am not even, I do not have any computers yet, so, and I will probably be like can I save at least $90 before I start that."" [Agent] ""Oh OK. No, of course, so yeah, you can always add that on at any time."" [Customer] ""Uh, OK."" [Agent] ""Perfect, so everything is all set for the 7th between X and X just to give you a quick recap once again, monthly rate's going to be $170 to your promotion, no contracts, and it is a one-time install fee of $100 that'll be on the first bill. Nothing is given to the technician once again the day of install. The tech will give you a call about XX-XX minutes out. Um, oh, what number would you like the technician to call again?"" [Customer] ""XXX XXX-XXXX"" [Agent] ""Perfect, thank you. And promotion also includes our, uh, protection plan powered by Assurian. So for example, if once you have any issues at the location, if it is related, non-optim related, it would never be a fee for a tech to come out that is powered by Assurian and technically valued at $30 as part of the bundle and. Everything is all set for you."" [Customer] ""OK, so um. Uh, so, so every month, what is my monthly bill going to be?"" [Agent] ""XXX."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And once again it is no contracts you can stop service at any time without any penalties or cancellation disconnect fees, nothing."" [Customer] ""Alright, and you guys OK. Right, and they are going to set up two phone jacks for me, right?"" [Agent] ""Correct, well, two phone lines. So the phone service comes through our modem, right, same scenario, so that it is going to be powered technically through the modem, but they are going to set up two phone lines for you."" [Customer] ""Or something like that. Yeah. Right, so, so what I mean is like, are they going to be jacked on the wall type thing or?"" [Agent] ""No, because no one does like the jacks type of um scenario anymore."" [Customer] ""I, I do not know."" [Agent] ""Those are old copper lines. So if you have like office phones or let us say like satellite phones, they could be anywhere on property and they will pick up long as the main phone is plugged into the modem, then the other phone could be X offices away just give you an example, it will ring you could pick it up. So it could be anywhere at the location."" [Customer] ""OK, so, so I am going to have X different phone numbers?"" [Agent] ""Correct, you would have X different phone numbers. You can do call forwarding, call waiting, of course you have. So for example, let us say you only give out X number. So let us say you are on both lines you are on a phone call. Another call comes in."" [Customer] ""Mm."" [Agent] ""You put the first person on hold. You talk to the 2nd person, and if the 3rd call comes in, it will automatically roll over to the 2nd line, so someone else would be able to pick up that line the same thing if another call comes in, they will be able to put that person on hold and pick up."" [Customer] ""Right. Mhm."" [Agent] ""So now technically you have X lines, both a call waiting, so you can handle like X calls at the same time."" [Customer] ""Mm, so I, so I would just purchase a regular phone and plug it in?"" [Agent] ""You would need an office phone for that type of scenario yeah, you could purchase in the meantime any regular phone"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""And it will work."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And then let us say as you guys grow you can look into like bigger office type of phones to where you might have a call like to put the person on hold they might hear music in the background you could transfer it or something like that, but you would have to see what type of phones you need for the location."" [Customer] ""OK. Huh, OK. That sounds like a challenge just to get a phone."" [Agent] ""No, it is easy. I hear a lot of people."" [Customer] ""Not many phones I have that I can not really."" [Agent] ""Yeah, well, hopefully."" [Customer] ""I have X, I I have X, go ahead, sorry"" [Agent] ""No, no, go ahead."" [Customer] ""So I have one, It is like some sort of Verizon mobile office phone that I Can not you Um, and then that, then there are the two other phones, well, XX that I got stolen, and then I have the X other ones that are brand new. I, I, I have these phones, right. Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah. So that is why I was like this phone thing is so confusing."" [Agent] ""Hopefully the ones that you have should be able to work if it is a standard jack with the phone, then you should be fine."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK. OK."" [Agent] ""If anything that would definitely say see if you can return them, but it is a standard type of office phone you or and it should say standard type of jack you should be fine."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK. All right, sounds No, it do not show me, right, when they come, right?"" [Agent] ""X, 100%."" [Customer] ""Hopefully, well, hopefully I will be there when they come. OK."" [Agent] ""Yeah, but they will show you and even if, if anything, ask them to, you know, explain certain things to you that is what they are there for they will go over the whole set up with you."" [Customer] ""Oh. OK. All right, that'll be good. As long as I can use my computer, but I am going to get and I can be able to hook it up and use it."" [Agent] ""Perfect. Yeah, you definitely will."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Oh, you mentioned a mobile line."" [Customer] ""Oh."" [Agent] ""Do you guys need a mobile line for the location?"" [Customer] ""What, what do you mean by that?"" [Agent] ""Like a cell phone?"" [Customer] ""Um, Uh, I do not know. I, I mean, I have a cellphone in my hands. I mean, I, I, what do you mean like"" [Agent] ""No, I am sorry I thought you said um, Verizon had offered you a like a cell phone plan I thought you needed a cell phone plan for a second."" [Customer] ""Oh no, they, oh, that was another, that was the other Verizon. There are two Verizons. One with the with the cellphone type thing and then there is files."" [Agent] ""Mm."" [Customer] ""There are two different ones but they are both Verizon, but they are not."" [Agent] ""Got you."" [Customer] ""Connected to each other somehow. So I could not even use the phone with files because they are not the same thing I guess Right, so you guys offer a mobile phones, is that what you are saying?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, we do offer the mobile phones, um yeah, like for example if you, if you sign up with one line, you get a $40 discount on your internet bill"" [Customer] ""Yeah, OK."" [Agent] ""Uh, one line is $45 monthly. You get unlimited talk, text, and data. You have an option of bringing over your own phone or you have an option of leasing a phone through us, so it just depends on the type of scenario that you are looking for."" [Customer] ""Oh What to think of is like if you know the the mobile phones were hooked up to. The phone so that if someone's standing outside, they can still talk like, you know, like a walkie talkie type thing"" [Agent] ""No, I see what you are saying, yeah, you know, like you would, you could do call forwarding and have like the calls forwarded to the cell phone, but it is not going to be like."" [Customer] ""Well, you know, well,"" [Agent] ""To where you could transfer a call to the mobile phone and like you said take it outside or something like that."" [Customer] ""Mhm. So I can see like a regular phone but it is mobile."" [Agent] ""Yeah, just a technically a regular cell phone."" [Customer] ""With an Oh, OK. All right. I will keep that in mind you know"" [Agent] ""Yeah, if anything, let us know and we will definitely get that set up for you."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Yeah, because you know we are, we are probably going to have to be mobile people you know, I do not All right, so, OK. I will talk to you more about that."" [Agent] ""Perfect so everything once again is all set for you."" [Customer] ""Just trying to figure it."" [Agent] ""Anything else we can do for you today?"" [Customer] ""OK. Um, no. Uh, yeah, let me say. Thank you so much."" [Agent] ""You are very welcome and once again thank you for choosing Optimum here at Optimum."" [Customer] ""So"" [Agent] ""You have a good one. I am sorry, go ahead."" [Customer] ""OK, oh, do you guys offer, one thing, do you guys offer like tech setups, like, do they offer that kind of thing like? Like, uh, tech, um, like learning platforms you like a tech person."" [Agent] ""Like technical support type of thing. Not like a learning platform."" [Customer] ""Like a person would just."" [Agent] ""But promotion does come with our built-in protection plan."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""So if you have any issues, technical issues at the location with devices not working properly or whatever the scenario may be from computers to laptops, printers we can troubleshoot those items for you. So it does come with the built-in protection plan, but not like um like a class type of scenario or anything like that a tech would um possibly come out to the location or troubleshoot it remotely over the phone."" [Customer] ""OK. OK, and also XX thing, do you like I know Verizon had offered um. Promotion of the business through some sort of search engine. They need like XX different, they, they, they um Provide you with like at least XX different search engines or something like that, your info, like once you get the website set up, I do not know how they said it, but. Um, they promote the business, businesses like that instead of you having to do that yourself and You know, shoot your information through Instagram or they just automatically. Push that through for you."" [Agent] ""Nothing per se like that, but we do offer certain things like, uh, for example, our pro Wi Fi access point. Let us say if you have that for guests that come in, want to log into the internet, or let us say if you have like, um, a lobby type of area or outside sitting area and people log into it or even just passing by, you would have to capture their email address or their telephone number for them to use your access point which would be free Wi Fi for them. You can also market to them once you capture that information."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So for example, you can send them emails if you have uh the phone number, then you can send them text messages. This is what we are offering this month flashal whatever this type of scenario may be you can advertise to those people like that. So every time someone is on it could show you also how many repeat people you have logging on to your Wi Fi. So if you see someone that is logged in X or X times in one week, but they are not enrolled or using your program or at the location, they might be just stopping by eating something from a local deli or something in the area and using the network you can advertise to them. So we do offer that with our pro Wi Fi."" [Customer] ""Mm."" [Agent] ""The pro Wi Fi itself is 39.99 monthly, uh, same thing, it is no contracts or anything like that with it. A lot of new businesses do find it helpful. But let us say once again if that is something after X month or X months you find out is not working for you or is not giving you the feedback you wanted from customer use with it then you can always take it off."" [Customer] ""Mm. Mhm."" [Agent] ""But it has a great analytics network that comes with it."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK, alright, so we just start out with just this and then I will see after that, you know."" [Agent] ""So say that part again."" [Customer] ""Uh, no, I said let me just start out with the, you know, just the phone and your internet and see what I you know"" [Agent] ""Yeah No, of course, as you grow, what else you might need down the line?"" [Customer] ""Right now I am just so clueless and so uh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah."" [Agent] ""I will send you an email."" [Customer] ""You guys, you know, you send information and stuff I could just read over like wow, this day off and this that I you know I. Yeah, you know, I could look into it like that so."" [Agent] ""Exactly, so I will send you an email with like a link to the pro Wi Fi access points so you can read up on it, see if that is something you might need in the future."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And if you are looking to expand or upgrade any services, you can always reply to that email, and I will give you a call and we will take it from there."" [Customer] ""OK. We will see them tomorrow and Wednesday between X and X."" [Agent] ""Perfect. Correct, and I am sorry, can you verify your email address for me one more time?"" [Customer] ""Mhm.""

Um, we do have our XXX meg right now that we can offer with a X year price guarantee at XX."" [Customer] ""XX"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Uh huh, uh, uh, is that, do you know if it is faster than what they are offering me?"" [Agent] ""So let me see, I am looking here to see exactly what they offer at this location because that is, that could be their, their hotspot or it could be their, their XXX meg Internet. So let us see what they offer here. So that is a hot spot that is why it is so cheap. So you are, you are looking at getting maybe XXX megabytes per second with that offer where I can offer you XXX megabytes per second at $90."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Mhm. Uh huh, so I am getting more for $10 just $10 more."" [Agent] ""Mhm.

I had an issue with you guys, uh, you did, you came in and charged me all these fees, and I, I never, I can not, I returned the thing and I just never paid anything because I was just ticked off, so I do not know if that is going to be, be an issue."" [Agent] ""What Do you know what type of fees you were charged?"" [Customer] ""I was at one location Mm."" [Agent] ""Do you know what kind of fees?"" [Customer] ""I do not know. I remember they did so I, I took my question Is there an installation fees?"" [Agent] ""So there normally is a one time installation of $100. That is the only fee that I can know that I know about because your $90 is going to include your equipment that is going to include all your surcharges, um, and then on the internet only we do not charge taxes like the city does not charge taxes so you are just looking at $90."" [Customer] ""Yeah So wait, so I, I have, is there an installation fee for this?"" [Agent] ""Yes, there is normally XXX, uh, a one time installation of XXX."" [Customer] ""Uh huh, is there any way to avoid that?"" [Agent] ""So if we get something on our schedule today I can possibly reach out to my supervisor to see if we can uh waive that for you."" [Customer] ""Uh, I, I, and it is, what is it XX flat or is there taxes or any other fees that I would, I, I should know about?"" [Agent] ""No, we do not charge, uh the city does not charge taxes on internet only, so that you would just see $90 flat"" [Customer] ""So you Oh Yeah, yeah, yeah, that is what I was going to ask you, um, $90.90 dollars in auto pay, um.""

[Agent] ""No, take your time."" [Customer] ""I have a que I am, I am while I am looking for it. I have a question, um. Uh, is there any way to get, uh, under the same? Internet, but two different routers. Can we do that?"" [Agent] ""With like the current customer that is here?"" [Customer] ""I because the problem is is I have we under the, under my bus uh well my business has multiple Amazon accounts, but they want to, I do not know if you know this, but you can not log in, uh, um, under one internet. You can not log in into one router, uh, both businesses, uh, it is, it is like frowned upon a, uh, to to Amazon. You are not allow to do that. They do not, they do not want you to have multiple Amazon accounts."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""So basically my question is, is, uh, I do not want to hire two different companies. I, I do not want to get another internet service to connect my other com uh, my other, my other, uh."" [Agent] ""Of course."" [Customer] ""Yeah, my other account because what I have is I have two different computers, uh, right now the way it works is I, I, I use, I use my, um, I use tablets. And uh that is connected already to the my T-Mobile service. So what I am doing is is I am connecting it is annoying."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""It is uh each computer has its uh the way we function now is that we have each tablet with its own internet service."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""So what I want to do is cut that out. I want to just connecting one internet service but two different routers where it is like has no correlation to you get, you get what I am trying to do"" [Agent] ""Yeah, no, I definitely get so it comes with a different like uh IP address."" [Customer] ""Correct."" [Agent] ""Like whenever you sign in, so we are going to provide you with your first one. You can always purchase the second one and you do have the ability to put it on there. We also offer static IPs."" [Customer] ""What does that mean?"" [Agent] ""So a static IP is um where your static IP address like stays the same instead of constantly changing um so it is more or less a designated IP address and we have the ability to offer you up to X so you could put um a static IP on like one computer on another computer and another computer assign it to each one and so that whenever it kind of like searches like what you are saying like logging into Amazon or whatever it would see different IP addresses based off all of those devices."" [Customer] ""Uh, how does that, how would, how does that work? How, how does, uh, so if I connect to one computer onto under the internet, how does it differentiate, I mean, how do I differentiate them?"" [Agent] ""So in Yeah, so you get a special router to where in that router you are able to assign the static IPs to each device."" [Customer] ""Oh I mean I am going to have to purchase a second router"" [Agent] ""So, well, no, when you get static IPs with us, we bring you that special router, um, that you are able to assign all these static IPs to different devices, or you can purchase your own router so that you have to because we are going to provide you with your first one and then you can always purchase another one and attach it."" [Customer] ""Uh huh OK. OK, so now if I had with this router that you guys are providing me with, uh, I have I have up to X you are saying XXX static IPs"" [Agent] ""Mm, so we have the option to provide you X static IPs. If we were to set you up with the X static IPs, it would be an additional XX. So in total we would be looking at XXX for the total bill."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK. Uh huh, OK, fine. Let us, let us stick with one. Let us see how the, uh, oh, OK, so let us try the internet first, uh, before I jump if it is if you know, if I like it, uh, again, if I do not, if I, if because what happened with my place is that the internet sucked."" [Agent] ""OK Now sometimes that is because of speed because because you will go for like a lower speed because of the price point, um, like, like earlier I quoted you for our X gig internet that is our fastest speed it is going to be able to handle any devices, any uploads, anything, um, but you know as you go lower, of course the price is going to go lower but you are also like jeopardizing the speed and having issues issues like that."" [Customer] ""So with I and I, I think I got Optimum, and they, uh, it did not work good well with my original place so hopefully this time will work. Yeah Yeah. Yeah. Lower states Yeah."" [Agent] ""And so that is I would that is why I would recommend our XXX over their XXX they can give you and we are going to be giving you a better speed, a better service, and it can handle up to about XX devices so that will work great for you."" [Customer] ""Correct. Yeah. Is it, is it, uh, is it fiber fi, uh, files fiber optic, what do they call them?"" [Agent] ""And Um, so what Files is able to offer here is not fiber optic, it is hotspot. It is a XG network."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh. OK, but what you are, you are providing me is just regular internet, is that or?"" [Agent] ""We So this, uh, this is actually fiber at this location, so you would see a symmetrical upload and download speed."" [Customer] ""OK, so I am getting a fiber, uh, whatever. The faster, like the faster uh fiber, whatever they call it."" [Agent] ""Um, so you would be getting our XXX meg fiber."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""One more second."" [Agent] ""Were you able to find that tax ID?"" [Customer] ""Um, just give me a second, let me just look. I am looking for it so I have it."" [Agent] ""OK, take your time.

[Customer] ""Same address."" [Agent] ""And then how do they do they put like a unit do they put rear front?"" [Customer] ""You could put up front. I do not have it."" [Agent] ""Right.""

[Agent] ""We will be able to bring over tablets as well, mhm."" [Customer] ""Would that cover that? Instead of the phone, because what I am going to do, because what I am doing, what happens is my I pay for my, uh, uh, unfortunately that it is done that way since I have a couple of lines with T-Mobile, I end up paying for the businesses, um, uh, tablets because it just comes from my, it comes directly from my bill and I, I am not going to calculate that."" [Agent] ""Hm Mhm."" [Customer] ""So I am wondering if I instead of transferring, um, instead of transferring, um, phones, I will transfer the tablet maybe would that work?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, that would definitely work."" [Customer] ""That that."" [Agent] ""You would still, you would still get that discount on that as well. Um, now with our tablet services right now they are running XX XXXX after taxes, and that would be, um, it comes with unlimited talk and text with XX gigs of data."" [Customer] ""Oh no, I get unlimited internet with my with it. I, no, do not pay off. It does not pay off for me because I am, I am paying if I am paying XXX and uh XX, I, I would say roughly from what I remember last week, probably XXX and it is like I have like X lines on there then the tablet service is is probably nothing, yeah"" [Agent] ""Mhm. Oh, OK, OK. Have, have you been with them for quite some time?"" [Customer] ""I would say over XX years."" [Agent] ""Oh yeah, then you are, you are definitely grandfathered in with them because early like I was looking at recently at their plans and one line was $120 so you are definitely got some great deals with them."" [Customer] ""Yeah. Yeah, yeah, no, I, I am not, I am paying like XXX bucks. I am, I, I, I, I could be, I could be off by like X or XX bucks, but, uh, because I, I remember seeing it on my credit, not on my credit card I mean my, uh, auto pay, uh, just vaguely just seeing something like that, but, uh, yeah, it is roughly around that place, yeah."" [Agent] ""Oh OK. Yeah, you must be grand grandfathered into something. I would love to see like if you are open to me seeing like what one of your bills are, I can send you over some like uh offers that we have and maybe you can see if something works for your business even if it is not like moving one of your numbers over maybe we can even just set you up a new number or something just so you can get those additional discounts yeah and then um.""

[Agent] ""Mhm and then since we are getting."" [Customer] ""And we just make sure before before we wrap things up, just make sure that uh fee for the installation is that we can get avoid that."" [Agent] ""Great minds think like Mike because that is what my next sentence was is that we did go ahead and uh credit that for you and so there will not be any type of installation."" [Customer] ""OK perfect."" [Agent] ""Yes, sir, and then did you have a card or a bank account you wanted to use for auto pay?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, can I add that later on?"" [Agent] ""You can, um, yeah, before the month is due you can always add that."" [Customer] ""Uh, before the month is due?"" [Agent] ""I just have to submit this without the discount, so it would be XX until you apply the autopay discount."" [Customer] ""Cool, cool, I just, uh, well because if the service works. No problem. I just want to make sure that the service works because I am again I had a very negative, uh, experience last time and of course, but I do not care"" [Agent] ""Oh, of course."" [Customer] ""I am paying the bill I am paying the bill Might as well just go to pay it and leave me alone, you know, but, uh, I just want to make sure that the service works.""

If you forget it, we will just ask for the last four of your tax ID do you want to do something like really simple we can do XXXX"" [Customer] ""I am going to say that you do XXXX, but I know I am almost sorry and I am going to forget it.""

[Customer] ""I would never, it would never come to mind. I use this code for some, some stupid stuff, uh, but, uh, that is why I am, I am, I am giving it, um, but, uh, let, let us see if I will remember that I, I know myself"" [Agent] ""OK. OK, oh, OK, well, that is OK."" [Customer] ""Um"" [Agent] ""Like I said, we can use the last four of the tax ID easy peasy. OK."" [Customer] ""Alright, yes, yes, OK.""

[Agent] ""OK, do you have the X digit access code that is on this account?"" [Customer] ""Yes, it is uh. XXXX."" [Agent] ""Excellent thank you very much. Alright, and let us work on getting this upgraded here. Is it a doctor's office?"" [Customer] ""No lawyer."" [Agent] ""Lawyer, OK, so I just so, OK, so."" [Customer] ""Maybe"" [Agent] ""OK, so when is busiest, how many devices are hooked up to the internet there?"" [Customer] ""Um, Really not many, um. It is like you got a computer in the office. We got X, you know, phones that we scan the internet from when we are lounging."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""And we have got X TVs that we stream. So that is where, that is a lot of where the issue comes from."" [Agent] ""Got you."" [Customer] ""It is getting the signal from the router, which is X years old, in the basement, up to, up to an extender which looks like it is freaking something from XXXX."" [Agent] ""Yeah"" [Customer] ""And then from the extender to, you know, a decent signal to the TV in the bedroom upstairs or even in the, even in the living room, sometimes it is just always buffering or."" [Agent] ""Yeah, well,"" [Customer] ""So, I think with a good extender and a, and a You, you know, new modem, that they will communicate better we should be fine It is, like I said, it is not, it is not terrible, but it is, it is lacking."" [Agent] ""Yeah You know, I, I think I know exactly what the issue is, is you have a very outdated internet speed, so you are at XXX megabits, so I mean really just the devices that you read off are probably right maxing out the bandwidth."" [Customer] ""It is very sluggish."" [Agent] ""It is uh for streaming things like it is very standard to be at the gig now um. So which it would be XXXX so we could do that we could add the pro Wi Fi as well and that that will work as uh perfect as you know getting every connectivity, everything, I think you are going to be uh. Yeah, yeah, that'll be perfect. Just bear with me one sec."" [Customer] ""Alright, my price is still the price will still be locked in at XXX, right?"" [Agent] ""So But there will be a change, uh, and I am going to, it should not be much. It should be something about uh probably around $59 because you are going, like I said, you are going up to actually no, hold on, it is actually going to be a little less, uh, it is going to be about $45. It is like I said, you go up to the gig and you are adding the pro Wi Fi, uh, and the pro Wi Fi acts as a second network too, so you actually can do a lot with that, you know, I mean you can, um, do you have, uh, like, do you like other people access the network as well?"" [Customer] ""No, it is just us in our house."" [Agent] ""OK, well, I was just saying because there is sometimes people they, they have that or if they have a a rent or something like that they let people access it, you know, this would be acting the second network, um."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, no, we do not have much activity on it."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""I think just with the pro I think just with the pro Wi Fi. And the and the swapping out the route will be sufficient."" [Agent] ""Well, that is what it is. I mean the pro it is, it is just adding the pro Wi Fi that is, uh you are basically getting the upgrade for free It is adding the pro Wi Fi because the pro Wi Fi is 39.99. Your difference of the bill is going to be 44.99. That is it. And this will be a XX year price, you know, same thing, no contracts."" [Customer] ""Well, they told me to swap out and get the extender and the new router does not cost anything."" [Agent] ""They do not really have this."" [Customer] ""I keep saying."" [Agent] ""Um, we do not really have an extent this, this is I mean, basically like I said, you are basically getting You are basically getting everything as as a wash, you know what I mean this you are upgrading from XXX to XXXX and your bill, like I said, is only changing for the cost of the pro Wi Fi because the pro Wi Fi is not free, so that is what I am saying the pro Wi Fi is XXXX, that is it."" [Customer] ""Is that 39.99 a month or XX sorry."" [Agent] ""Yes ma'am. Yeah, a month."" [Customer] ""It is a month?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, so."" [Customer] ""Alright, well, I do not want, I do not want to do that now they told me that you can switch it your price will stay the same It is always X."" [Agent] ""Yeah, they unfortunately, pro they definitely should not have told you that then that is fine. So we could still like get again yeah, we could still get the upgrade, alright, OK, and then hold on one second Yeah, so, so we could still upgrade you and get you to the gig. I am trying to see what we have here. Just bear with me one second."" [Customer] ""I do not need I just need a I need a new I need a new router modem and uh and um."" [Agent] ""I mean Well that is that is what this is. That is see, that is what this is. This is a new router modem combo, right this is, we do not even do the XXX speed you have anymore Like that is what I am saying that is how outdated it is. So just to do that, you know, like I said, it changes, gets you to the gig. It is $30 it is $35 difference a month. You do the auto pay's difference of $30. Do you have um mobile or tablets for the business?"" [Customer] ""Um, No, no, they are all landlines which are through Optimum."" [Agent] ""OK, yes, I, I see you have the X."" [Customer] ""And. Yeah, we have X landlines and internet throughout the."" [Agent] ""Yeah, well, we teamed up we teamed up with, uh, T-Mobile to use their networks along with ours"" [Customer] ""No."" [Agent] ""So for businesses, if you bundled a mobile or a tablet line, I can give you a $40 discount on the gig internet. And you can use the phone for whatever, you know what I mean, you do not have to buy a new phone if you have a phone that you know you just want to activate, you could do that as well, uh. Simply for businesses, you know if you add a line, you get the savings"" [Customer] ""Yeah, and you say that if we add a line that'll be. Minus the $49 a month for the router."" [Agent] ""It, it would be, it will give you a $40 discount on the gig into that price, yes. That is what we are doing for."" [Customer] ""I All right, well, I, I do not know if she wants to do that."" [Agent] ""That is what we we are coming over to Opera mobile."" [Customer] ""We just want to get a little bit of an increase in the internet."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Maybe we will change our motive in the future, but um."" [Agent] ""OK, that is fine. Well, you, you could leave yours. You could switch, you could add new whatever you want to do."" [Customer] ""Oh."" [Agent] ""But this way with this, there is also a XX day money back guarantee. So like that is what I suggest to everyone try this out. I with this upgrade. This is going to fix all your connectivity issues. You are not going to have any issues going forward."" [Customer] ""Yeah. Can I, what about he suggested upgrading just to XXX, he said, and get that router."" [Agent] ""Well, that the XXXs I mean, I, I am just going to be honest with you, this is the best bang for your buck That is, that is, that is what I am trying to, to give you here. If you upgrade to this, you get your, your connectivity, and this is still, you know, one of the best we offer so you are going to have not going to have issues if you upgrade to the XXX X months from now, you know you say, hey, you know what, I am going to need more You are going to have to do this all over again right now this is the promo you are going to get the new promo price for this one."" [Customer] ""Um, yeah, it is a big bang for the buck I do not need a big bang I just need the extender and the new router because this one's up."" [Agent] ""I mean we Well, we do not really have like a like an extender per se. The closest thing would be the pro Wi Fi, but let me, let me see what I could do here because if we go to the XXX that we will see what that does just to try and, you know, get you, I know listen, we live on Long Island Every everything's expensive. I want to try , you know, I want to try and help you every way I can, so just bear with me one sec"" [Customer] ""Yeah, I mean all the people I talked to said there would not be uh uh a fee charge for it."" [Agent] ""No, that is, I am, I am sorry that they, I am sorry that is not like I wish, I wish it unfortunately, but, uh, yep, I mean that that is it I mean what I was doing, I was waiving, uh, any installation fee, so I mean I was already doing that."" [Customer] ""It is"" [Agent] ""So let me get"" [Customer] ""I do not know. Maybe I will switch to T-Mobile. I it is a different story with different optimum so I do not know"" [Agent] ""And if you switch the team over you are going to switch right back."" [Customer] ""I talk about it."" [Agent] ""I am just going to save you the trouble because I mean I have been sitting there working with everyone, uh you know, switching people back from competitors all year so I would hate to see you have to do that all over again So just let me see what I could do, try and get you the best promo. The gig is really like I said, the best bang for your buck because you are already paying $290 you know, so your bill was only going to was going to change XX bucks you were going to get a significant upgrade So just give me one sec. OK, I want to make sure I got."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I I do not need too big of an upgrade with the speed. I just Need a new router modem. And an extender."" [Agent] ""OK, yeah, that is what I said they do not really do any extenders that is like, like for for business is not really much of the pro Wi Fi kind of access it we are ruling that out So I mean really what we could do. I am trying to get you the best the best I possibly can get here then then you do not have cameras or anything there, correct"" [Customer] ""Cameras? No."" [Agent] ""OK, make it sure."" [Customer] ""We, we do not have much. We just have one computer and one smart TV and"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""A couple of cell phones."" [Agent] ""Got you."" [Customer] ""But the equipment is so freaking old."" [Agent] ""Yeah, and that is why we need to get you new everything."" [Customer] ""She has Yeah."" [Agent] ""So if, if we upgrade you to the XXX, right, the $500 and with the, the business, the premier, you know, it is, it is a tech support, but it is also, uh, product protection, you know, that that we offer for businesses it is about $10,000 in coverage a year. The bill only changes $10 a month and then you go to the $500 so you are more than doubling what you have now and that should fix that and that is giving you new hardware and everything too."" [Customer] ""There is XXX and new hardware. What is new hardware?"" [Agent] ""That is the uh the the the modem router that is the you are getting new brand new equipment, you know, top and bottom, making sure everything's, you know, up to date. You are definitely better than, you know what you had from X years ago And the same thing X year, X year price uh price fix on that no contract, same thing."" [Customer] ""Um, And how much would it be a month for the internet?"" [Agent] ""So the whole, the whole thing together instead of the $290 you are paying it goes to XXX and I waived the installation fee."" [Customer] ""OK, and I will get a new router modem uh the the pro Wi Fi or whatever"" [Agent] ""Yeah. Now there is no pro Wi Fi with this you are probably not going to need it with with what you are telling me how, how big is the entire, the, the space you are trying to cover? It is just a house you said?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, it is a house and like the technician like he told me he said, he said it is a pretty big house, so if you are trying to get serviced on the 2nd floor and your router is in the basement, he said, you know, you, you need to have the extender, so."" [Agent] ""Might be able to move."" [Customer] ""I do not have."" [Agent] ""If they move the router to the main floor, you know, that might help too, so I mean I can make a note on there because I mean that could fix a lot of it because I mean I I said I am I am out by you I have um a two story mother daughter and mine mine's on the other end of the house I have no issues So it was simply my basement."" [Customer] ""OK The one, the one thing is, um, I do not think. We will be able to switch the router location because in the basement where the router is, there is also like I do not know what you call them switches there is all these switches with X lines running up to the outlets in her office"" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Which, which you know, she never even uses the outlets, I do not think hardwire, um, except for maybe one more than the extender , so, um, I do not think switching the router location is going to"" [Agent] ""And so stop fees."" [Customer] ""What we want to do."" [Agent] ""Well this is going to give, I mean you are going to have a stronger signal anyways so like I said, what you had was a very small bandwidth and very outdated so this is going to be better across the the board and if Texas is there and deems that you need some sort of extender, you know, they will work with it too. Well this, well this right now, I mean again you are, you are more than doubling what you have. I think this is going to fix everything you are saying and if for some reason it does not and you do need to upgrade to the gig you can because there is no contracts so you are free to do all that. So I can actually have a tech there on the 12th, that is uh next Monday."" [Customer] ""All right, but the one thing, um, I am wondering about you said he can get us some type of extender. If it is not working out."" [Agent] ""Poss. No, that is what I am saying. Then we would have to get something like a pro. We do not really have an extender for business like that is what I am saying. It is not and it is not much you could always set up like your own kind of extender, but I do not really think um. You know, like I said, we do not really have them for business I am going to make a note like I am, I am notating the uh the file and everything you are saying, you know, the, uh So the routers is. And you said it is the basement correct? So that is it. So the tech and the tech could do that, you know, I am going to be available the day of installation and everything too, so they are going to make sure you, you are going to have a stronger signal. It is going to work throughout the house much better. I mean you do not have concrete walls, correct?"" [Customer] ""Um, Only in the basement where the router is, but"" [Agent] ""Yeah, like, so typically in the basement that is what I am saying like if they do."" [Customer] ""Signal goes up."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so you, so you should be fine. Like I guess the only time like, uh, you ever go to like a restaurant something like they had like the big cement walls sometimes they run into issues that also depends on, you know the square footage, you know what I mean So I think you are going to be fine with this. Now and I have XX to X available on the 12th."" [Customer] ""Um, on May 12th."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so that is next Monday."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So"" [Customer] ""Can you send me uh Do you send me a reminder or anything or no?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, you are going to get you are going to get an email from Optimum. They are going to do that. They are going to email again and confirm everything and it is uh NY counselor at Hotmail.com is the email we have."" [Customer] ""Yeah, what about tax, do you do text?"" [Agent] ""Uh, I do not know if they text. I do not know it. I know that the tech will call beforehand. The tech, the tech calls when they are on their way you get, you will get multiple emails prior"" [Customer] ""On this number. OK, I want it on this number though to call because."" [Agent] ""The XXX-XXX. I am sorry I put the wrong I put I am I am sorry this is XXX"" [Customer] ""Yeah, XXX."" [Agent] ""XX,XXX,XXX"" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""OK, yeah, so, OK, so, so recap, you are getting the the upgrading for the XXX, the $500 with the product protection difference of $10 a month. I waived any installation fee. Tech is coming Monday the 12th, XX to X is the window. About XX minutes half an hour before arrival, the tech's going to call XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""Alright, payment, uh, I made a note that it routers in the basement we will go from there So keep an eye out for the NY counselor email and they will make, uh, they will have everything there to confirm the appointment and everything, and you will be good to go."" [Customer] ""OK, um, one other question, can you tell me if I did? When we get the pro Wi Fi but. What deal you can get me on that."" [Agent] ""It would, it would be another 39.99 a month for the pro Wi Fi."" [Customer] ""Uh Yeah. Huh. And where does that get located? That is like an extender, you put it like in the middle floor and it"" [Agent] ""Yeah, they, they would, uh, well, the tech would probably, you know, he would, you know, analyze the area and tell, OK, it is probably best if he did it here, you know, that type of deal."" [Customer] ""Yeah, right. OK. Um, All right. Well, you know we will try this out Swing the new router may help. It does not need much. It just needs a little bit more."" [Agent] ""This, this should definitely do the job then it is because you are you are already doing that with the XXX. This this will do the job and and I think you will be very happy with it.""

[Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Um, we could do an unlimited line for basically $47 including. Um, the taxes and you would get $40 off on your internet service. So there is a cell phone that you want to test out or anything like that just to see how it works with us, literally $7 gets you a unlimited, um, text, call and XX gigs of premium data on your service, test it out, see how it works, and it could potentially add additional savings, um, because you know our lines could be as low as $25.""

[Customer] ""Uh, I will have to chat with the people that run that account for us, but uh, no, that is definitely something we will look into."" [Agent] ""Yeah. Not a problem. The good thing is is that if you do happen to have T-Mobile, you know what the coverage is like, so you would not be sacrificing anything exactly, and you have no contracts and no cancellation charges with our Optimum mobile service, so you know that is, yeah, so the way that it kind of works out $47 because it is $45.02 dollars in taxes, $40 off on the internet service, get to test out that first line for $7."" [Customer] ""It is not going to be a change, yeah. I like that."" [Agent] ""Um, but even if you go into like deeper numbers, $60 for two lines, you still get $40 off the internet service.

It will be $20 a month for just one static IP I, I will let you know that Optimum typically recommends that you get a block of X there is two reasons why The first reason is instead of $20 for one static IP address, it is $30.10 dollars extra for X blocks of IP addresses. Now you might only need one right now. But in the future if you have a need for another static IP address, what ends up happening is you lose the one that you have for the new X for the next one to appear. So I just want to try to avoid the situation in the future where you might need to have another IP address and you lose the one that you have. So you know it is, it is up to you. I, I, I prefer to give you the block of X so you have that as your business scales in the future."" [Customer] ""Got it. What, what is the difference between having X and X IP addresses?"" [Agent] ""So, um, sometimes businesses are like, you know we just need one static IP for security cameras, right And they start there and then as the business grows they end up, um, maybe it is a cash only business and they decide, you know what, we want some credit card machines so they get some credit card machines and then their their IT team says, hey, you, you need a static IP for this too and then they are like, OK, so then they call us and say hey we need to get another static IP address, but since they only had one. They lose that one so we can get them the X that they need to begin with so to avoid headaches down the line, I recommend, you know, you get the block of X so you have them in your back pocket for the future and they and they do not expire they are they are there forever."" [Customer] ""And they are $30 a month."" [Agent] ""Yes, yes, sir, absolutely, and I could waive the installation for you as well."" [Customer] ""I Uh, I am sorry, what?"" [Agent] ""Um, we will be waiving the installation fee. I am looking at your account. It is an excellent standing. Um, you have been a customer of ours now since January. No, no headaches there, um, so yeah, I, you know I would, I would be willing to, to waive the install fee for the static as well We will just see something, mhm."" [Customer] ""Got you.

[Customer] ""Of course."" [Agent] ""Perfect. And they could reach you at XXX-XXX-XXXX, right?"" [Customer] ""Sure. Yeah, yeah."" [Agent] ""OK perfect just so you know um your account is eligible for Optimum mobile services, uh, which means that whether it is the phone lines that are on your account, your phone line, uh, family, friends, any other employees, if you set up Optimum Mobile, you get up to $40 discount on your internet bill here and that does not expire that lasts for the life of that promotion. Um, excuse me, the, the life of how long that is linked together and the phone lines will be when it is all said and done like $5 a month because the phone lines are usually $25 a month for the mobile and you can keep your phone, you can keep your phone numbers of that $25.20 dollars will come off as a credit on your internet bill So like let us say, let us say the internet bill was was $100 and you put up two lines that you bring over. That $100 drops to $60 and then it is just $5.05 dollars for the other ones. So just something to consider if you would like I can send you an email with more information."" [Customer] ""That would be amazing."" [Agent] ""Yes, I bought, yeah."" [Customer] ""So if, if I sign up for X phone lines right now, X cell phones, right? You are saying X cell phones?"" [Agent] ""Mhm. Yeah, if you if like you have the two phones right now, I can go ahead and link that with your internet account I could save you $40 you know, right, right away It, it may take a couple billing cycles to see, but when you get the, when you get the bill in the mail, you will see the mobile discount itemized, so it will it will be like right there in front of you to, to make sure that you are getting the discount."" [Customer] ""So if I, so right now I am T-Mobile, I would transfer to you guys."" [Agent] ""Yeah, and it is funny you mentioned that, Nina because we, we use the T-Mobile network and we also use that in combination with our optimum hotspots and we have nationwide coverage, yeah, international calls."" [Customer] ""Really?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, I was just actually talking to another business owner, uh, about this, um, and they are actually going to have, uh, they are a landscaping company, so they have people out in the field. So they are, their supervisors that are with, uh, I think they are with Verizon if I remember correctly, they are going to be bringing their numbers over to Optimum, all X of them."" [Customer] ""So if, if I am paying $100 for internet I add two lines My total bill, instead of $100 would be like $70 a month."" [Agent] ""That is correct, nailed it nailed it on the head, mhm."" [Customer] ""So that it would actually go down if I transfer lines."" [Agent] ""Yes, yes, and you do not, you will still stay, you will still stay within the T-Mobile network you will not be paying their prices You are, you are going to see a significant savings you get to keep your phone , and the phone numbers"" [Customer] ""Could you please send me an email with that information?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, send it over right now. Let me just, um, because the email that I have here, uh, I think it is you. I just want to make sure it is spelled correctly. We have Mina, that is M as in Mary, I as in igloo, N as in Nancy, A as in apple. Uh It looks like the number X and then Isaac A S A A C at gmail.com."" [Customer] ""You mean I S A A T?"" [Agent] ""That is correct, yes. M I N A, the number X I S A A C at gmail.com."" [Customer] ""Yeah, that is it."" [Agent] ""OK, perfect. I am going to send you that email right now uh you know whenever you are free, you know, just let me know I will call you directly so that we have your inside guy You do not have to call out on them anymore you just reach out to me I will call you one on one, OK"" [Customer] ""That'd be great. And I wanted to ask you if I have not been using the internet service at the business because we did not open yet, does Optum offer any discounts for that or like any um anything for that because we have not used it in a couple or X or X months."" [Agent] ""Mm. Uh, you know what?"" [Customer] ""And we are probably not going to be using it for the coming X months either."" [Agent] ""Um, you know, let me, yeah, let me get this template. I am going to get the mobile email information to you really quick, and then what I will do is, um, I will get you over to our billing department for that, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK. Sure."" [Agent] ""We need all copy. Put that here. And thank you for bringing that up so I could take care of that for you."" [Customer] ""Oh, thank you."" [Agent] ""OK, make sure you get the $40 discount. So let us say, let us say because you can have up to XX phone lines linked um, I could do X at a time but you could have up to XX but let us say, let us say you have X, right Uh, the first two phone lines will get you that $40 discount."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So the first two phone lines will just be $5 each per month and then the remaining X will just be $25 a month and if they do not have to be employees, um, I have had business owners say, you know what, I am on a. Family plan with Sprint. I might as well just bring my entire family plan over to Optimum Mobile because you know they still reap the benefit no matter what. Like we do not have stipulations on who can have the phone. Our only requirement is that the account is linked with your business account. That is all."" [Customer] ""And everything is unlimited the data and and everything"" [Agent] ""Yeah, correct. I mean, you know, there is, there is different plans, right? So this one is going to be, um, all our plans are unlimited talk, unlimited text you get high speed data Uh, this one will have X gigabytes of high speed data after that you, you can still use the data instead of just XG It just, it becomes XG. There is really like no difference, right?"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""um."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Yeah, I am a heavy data user like heavy, uh, my daughter uses her iPad when we drive she uses my phone as a hotspot I have not had any issues whatsoever."" [Customer] ""OK, oh wow."" [Agent] ""Mhm yeah."" [Customer] ""And so it would actually, it would, so it would actually um the the total bill would actually be less if I transfer a couple of phone lines at least."" [Agent] ""Much, much less, much less, yeah. Mhm."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Alright, so I am sending that here and OK, I just sent it. Mina, do you have access to that email right now, like push notifications on your phone?"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""OK, perfect.

Palace at gmail.com. Is that correct?"" [Customer] ""Correct."" [Agent] ""OK. M R O. Beautiful thank you so much one moment please. OK, so as far as the services I do see here that you had our internet service, including the modem, the router, so you are advising me that that is all you need this is a great time for you if you needed to go ahead and add a phone number to the location and the shop"" [Customer] ""Mhm. Mhm."" [Agent] ""This is a great time because what I have what I get to do at this time, um, to thank you for being a valued customer is that I get to reset your promotion. So basically you had a promotion for a certain amount of time now that I am able to go ahead and put the order again at the new address that order gets to be basically reset. So basically your promotion was going to end, let me tell you when your promotion was going to end. Your promotion was going to end um in March of XXXX. Now I get to give you another two years of promotions, and now it is going to end in May of XXXX. So you know you get another two year promotion on the service without any contracts or cancellation charges, OK?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, but I do not need to add no phone service. I am good with what I have."" [Agent] ""OK, so what are you doing for phone service for the location if you do not mind me asking please?"" [Customer] ""We have cloud phones so we are able to be fine with it."" [Agent] ""Uh, you have the cloud, got you, got you, got you."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""OK, no problem, and you do not want to go ahead and port those phone numbers over to Optimum because we can go ahead and give you great deals on it. Like each line is $40 the first one you get for $25 so there is definitely a way of getting um some amazing pricing structures within the location Is that something that you may want to consider doing at this time?"" [Customer] ""If it is not broken, I am not fixing it, it is just fine the way it."" [Agent] ""Understood, understood. Alrighty then, so as far as the services are concerned, um, you get another X years of promotion. The monthly rate, um, including the $5 discount for autopay and paperless would be $100."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, I would take just the installation which is $100 and then the."" [Customer] ""I was not paying $100 before."" [Agent] ""Uh, let me go ahead and take a look at the monthly rate that you had before in just a few moments, and I appreciate your patience. Because what we do is that we reset your promotion so that you get a new customer promotion with the current rates, but it lasts a longer time. So if you had let us say a specific promotion that was given to you back in XXXX in XXXX. Now basically you get the promotion that is available in XXXX, but it lasts until XXXX, which at the end of the day is a better deal overall because if you were to keep, let us say that promotion and you were not moving, then in March of XXXX, then it would go up to its regular pricing structure which would be more than $100. So at this point, you know, you are actually end up on the positive side of things. I see the monthly rate here. OK, so yeah, that was uh probably uh enough, you know, a specific promotion that was given to you back in March of last year. So basically when I move you over I can put."" [Customer] ""XX."" [Agent] ""Sorry, I do not know if you can hear me with the background."" [Customer] ""Yeah, mhm."" [Agent] ""Let me know if you can hear me. You can hear me? OK, perfect."" [Customer] ""I can hear you now. Yes."" [Agent] ""Beautiful. Thank you so much. So basically, when you move to the new location, it is no longer going to be regular price after March of XXXX. It will be that promotion at $100 until um until May of XXXX so you end up saving a lot more money than the little uh difference in pricing than the small difference in pricing structure Let me go ahead and see how quickly we can get somebody out there for you if this is OK."" [Customer] ""No, um, it is $100? No, I am not. I thought that is a one time activity. I had a break. I need to tell my This is not what I started with."" [Agent] ""No, I understand."" [Customer] ""I did not that with what."" [Agent] ""What you have, you have at your current location at XXX Hudson Turnpike."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So if you were to stay at this location, then you will have that promotion until March of next year."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""And then it goes to its regular pricing structure. Let me tell you what the regular pricing structure is in just a couple of seconds. No, it is. It would be XXX, which would be the regular pricing structure. So basically when you move you have to put you into the new account number because when you move it is a new address so now we have the opportunity to go up."" [Customer] ""But My current monthly charges is $75 right now."" [Agent] ""Correct. And if you decide to when."" [Customer] ""So why do I want to go up to $100?"" [Agent] ""Well, it is not that you would want to go up to $100 or anything like that. It is just that that is the current promotion that we go ahead and have right now."" [Customer] ""OK, I am going to hold out on it."" [Agent] ""It is $100 including the X."" [Customer] ""I, I am not going to set it up. I am going to check my order option because it do not make no sense."" [Agent] ""Well, I mean, keep in mind that I unfortunately, I can not go ahead and move you with those current rates at this time. If you would like, I can go ahead and speak to my superior if you would like to go ahead and have, give me just a few moments to see, because though that that promotion is not a promotion that exists anymore."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""It is like going to a store with something that you purchased last year and you want to purchase it again, but you are using last year's coupon. Unfortunately, the, the coupon will not scan. So I unfortunately."" [Customer] ""But I am, I still, yeah, I still, you know, I still have the, I am just moving the service you can find out from them if they are still going to give me the same price, I will do it, but if not, I do not want it."" [Agent] ""Exactly. Exactly. I will be happy to go. Understood, so bear with me just a few moments."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Let me go ahead and speak to my supervisor because at this point I do not have any other options to go ahead and provide you."" [Customer] ""Oh OK. Yeah OK."" [Agent] ""I am going to place you on hold for just a few moments I appreciate your patience"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""I am just going to bring this up to their information. Thank you. Thank you so much for holding for me. I really appreciate your patience and allowing me to reach out to my supervisor. The best that he was able to go ahead and do based on the information he gave me was to go ahead and give him one time installation and no charge because that was also something that you had also asked for. So I brought that up to his attention, so he said that he would go ahead and do that as a one-time courtesy and no charge for the transfer of the services, and the price would be $85 and that is for another X years. So you will actually end up getting a promotion for maybe 3.5, almost X and change years as opposed to X years. If this is OK with you, I would greatly appreciate it."" [Customer] ""So now it is going to be $85."" [Agent] ""Yeah, XXXX and you can actually bring that down to $80 if you ever want to do auto pay and paperless, because if you want to do autopay and paperless, it brings down the price $5 more, so you can bring it down to $8005. So once again, you get a no charge installation."" [Customer] ""I did the I did the XX, yeah."" [Agent] ""Thank you so much. So once again you have no charge installation and um that is another X years of promotion. Can you tell me what day you would like to have us in um at the location so that I can um check the calendar please?"" [Customer] ""Um, what is the earliest? It will be, it will be here Thursday. It will be here Friday I think"" [Agent] ""OK, we can do Thursday. We could, we could do Thursday X to XX if that is OK with you."" [Customer] ""OK. You did that is fine."" [Agent] ""OK, perfect, thank you. So I am going to do that and."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""They are going to call you on your cell phone about XX minutes before coming, OK, just to confirm that they are on their way."" [Customer] ""Mhm. All right."" [Agent] ""Thank you for giving me the opportunity to go ahead and speak to my superior regarding it."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""We greatly appreciate you.""

[Agent] ""Understood."" [Customer] ""I do not want to talk about it."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Let us stick to this and get this done and done. The early that day."" [Agent] ""Let me give you your account number. Let me give you your account number, please."" [Customer] ""Oh, my account number is changing.""

[Customer] ""Uh I have I have a um extra X month deal."" [Agent] ""I am listening."" [Customer] ""On the account before, does that still count?"" [Agent] ""I am not sure what that what that means an extra X month deal."" [Customer] ""OK, they gave me, they yeah, they gave me a X month free. Well, X. I did not use X already, but it said in the this one go with me no matter where I go."" [Agent] ""That is not the case."" [Customer] ""So that is gone."" [Agent] ""This is a brand new, yes, that was gone because it is now it is starting here and that is why we do it to another X years from the time."" [Customer] ""OK. OK OK.""

[Customer] ""Uh, sorry, can you give me a second? I am sorry can you give me a second"" [Agent] ""Yeah, Yeah, yeah, go ahead."" [Customer] ""I, I am getting a call. X minute. I am sorry."" [Agent] ""Yeah. Mhm. I"" [Customer] ""Sorry, yeah, yeah, sorry, I just got a cold."" [Agent] ""No worries. Um, so yeah, how many consoles would you say you have?"" [Customer] ""And that is pretty, that is a lot. I have XX computers, uh, X consoles, and the camera, and yeah, that is all."" [Agent] ""Oh Yeah, you know a gig, a gig can handle a lot"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I would say comfortably."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""You would sit in a good position if you had about maybe XX, XX computers, it would work perfectly, right?"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""After, you know, XX, XX, and, you know, the console, that is when you are really pushing the limits of the bandwidth, where there might be moments where you have a full lounge of people gaming, that is probably where you are noticing that it is struggling, right?"" [Customer] ""Yeah. Mm. Yeah."" [Agent] ""Fiber, of course, is going"" [Customer] ""No, that is, that is the uh, that is the part where I was the issue, but the thing is it was happening when it was only like, only X devices that were using like the X pieces."" [Agent] ""Oh wow."" [Customer] ""But then when it was getting busy, I had no issues, so it was, it was like randomly."" [Agent] ""Oh, that is weird."" [Customer] ""It was getting like in the morning when, yeah, that, that, that is the thing that was weird because there was like a packet but it is not about the speed, the speed is like uh it is stable. It is just the packet loss just uploading and the down it is like uh sending the packet, that is the issue I had. And I thought maybe it was maybe too many people are using it, but it happened when it was only XGs, so that is why I was thinking, I do not know."" [Agent] ""Mhm"" [Customer] ""But I mean as long as if I, if you are offering the fiber, it is going to be better than whatever is better for me to be honest, I just do not need an issue with the Wi Fi."" [Agent] ""Yeah, uh, well, you, as you may know, fiber is much better, um, it is going to be a whole new installation."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""You will get new equipment. It is no contract month to month, just how you are calling in, you know, we can make those changes, right?"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, if you were to do X gigabyte of fiber with, I see you have a number here, you will be at XXX."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Yeah, and I wanted to move the number also, but that is, that is the thing. I want to know the number and that yeah."" [Agent] ""So Yeah, so you will be at XXX with the number without the number you will be at XXX. So you are, you are really paying $15 for that number, OK?"" [Customer] ""Mm. Yeah. OK, then uh with the"" [Agent] ""But that, that, that, that would be the price. I will give you an example of what X gigs is X gigs is available in your area."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I am sure you will not have no issues with that, but that is about XXX."" [Customer] ""XXX. X, I see."" [Agent] ""Yeah, for X gigabytes of download and upload."" [Customer] ""I see. Uh, look, right now, the, I asked this question again. The right now the download, the speed is showing me the X gigabyte the upload is showing me the XX MBs"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""I mean, yeah, is it supposed to be like this or is it supposed to be showing the XGB?"" [Agent] ""Yep Yeah, yep, X."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK."" [Agent] ""No, no, XX is your maximum upload on coax. What you have right now is X gig down, XX up."" [Customer] ""Oh, I see."" [Agent] ""So you, you are getting what you are paying for. So if you switch to fiber, you will get X gig down, X gig up."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK. Mhm."" [Agent] ""That is what fiber is."" [Customer] ""Oh, I see."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Fiber is symmetrical download, upload."" [Customer] ""Oh, Oh, OK, then. I think I am going to get the XGB uh fiber, the XXX, you said, yeah, XXX."" [Agent] ""Uh, yeah, with the number it is Yeah, XXX with the phone number."" [Customer] ""OK, yeah, and I just want to remove the phone number and just say XXX digit and also the before that they transferred you to me. I mean they, I mean I got transferred to you and they already made an appointment for a technician to come and solve the issue with the package lost and since I am getting fiber, is it possible to get it today or actually I, I am going to have to find."" [Agent] ""No, that, that technician, that technician that is scheduled for today, that technician is uh. Basically a trouble call. They are, they go to fix a problem."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""They are not going to install fiber."" [Customer] ""Oh, I see."" [Agent] ""Fiber, we have designated technicians just for fiber installation. So I, I do not think I could get a technician to do it today, but definitely this week, I mean, today's Tuesday, you will have it before the weekends."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK, so, is it possible to get it on the the Tomorrow is also not possible, right? I am not sure is it."" [Agent] ""I could find out. I mean, I, I could really find out for you if you give me a couple of minutes. The only thing is that I am in the sales department."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I do not have a way to remove that number."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""The only way you can remove the number is by speaking to a retention specialist, but since you have me, what you could do is I could place the order for the gig, schedule it, and then you can just always call us back, Hey, can you remove that number and they will remove it for you."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Mhm."" [Agent] ""But I do not have a way to, yeah, if that is OK with you, we will, we will process it like that."" [Customer] ""OK, yeah, do not worry about it then, OK. Yeah, that is OK."" [Agent] ""It will be for XXX, but of course whenever you call, it will drop to like X, probably XXX."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""OK, um, let me find out when I can have a technician for you, but before I get started, do you know your access code to your account?"" [Customer] ""The access code, I think I, I usually get it from the email, right, the payment?"" [Agent] ""It is a X The Yeah, you, you must have created this X digit pin.""

[Agent] ""You can tell the difference between who is calling you. There will be an indication, OK, uh, my mom is calling me. There will be like a blue dot telling you someone's calling the T-Mobile number. If you see maybe a green dot, you will know, oh, that is, that is someone calling my business number.

[Customer] ""I"" [Agent] ""So in retail spaces we do not want POS systems to go down. We want people to be able to process transactions, especially with their phones and things of that nature. So you are going to have to fail over it is going to allow you to maintain internet and phone services even if there is a downtime. Telephone pole if it is, you know, if it is too hot in the summer, if it is too cold in the winter, you will still be able to maintain services for up to X hours. You are going to get a um this is business, so everything's going to be professionally set up. You are going to get a new gateway a new router, a new modem the tech is going to set up that X gig service Uh, it also is going to come with the static IP which is going to uh make sure that your cameras are communicating directly with the IP system, um in this way there is no lag or latency Uh, also this comes with a roll over line, uh, that is a not a mobile, uh, but that is a landline, so people use that for an alarm system or fax, um, and that is totally up to you. It is, it does come bundled into this promotion. Now keep in mind, although, um, you are going to be adding optimum equipment, your services and your products do come with support and protection. So not only does it of course cover all your optimum devices but any eligible devices. So say you get a big screen TV for your office or anything like that, keep in mind that if anything happens to that, whether it is a POS system a camera, any eligible device, instead of you going out and have to purchase something new, make sure you follow up with us directly to just see if if your devices are covered Um, now everything as I said, comes bundled in it will be itemized and you can review and make any changes you like, um, I am showing here. Not sure when you wanted to have services installed, uh, but you would be at XXX even, uh, there is a one time install of XXXXX. There is no contract there is no payment due today or to the tech Everything would be on a prorated bill. Let me see here Now it looks like as soon as we can get out to you we are pretty booked I can get someone out to you Thursday morning or Friday if that works for you."" [Customer] ""I think it is XXX is too much for me right now. It is a new business so I am really trying to keep everything as low as possible So I am trying to just get like, you know the basic service"" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Uh, what is, what do you have that is, but, you know, just internet and just phone."" [Agent] ""Yeah Well, that is my thing is that I want to be able to do that. I just want to make sure I am able to cover all the POS systems you did say you are not going to be adding any more cameras and at least for a little bit, right"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""OK, alright, so let me just see because I am, let me see here I think I can give you. The lower tier one second. OK, so I do have a promo code. I just want to see if it is, it looks like it expired, but I, I believe it is going to let me utilize it. Just allow me one second. I will be right back. OK, so it did work for me. What I was able to do is I was able to do what you said. You are just looking for the Internet and phone, so you are going to get the Internet, uh, X gig with, uh, fail over with that phone. Uh, you will be at $135 even. That is even without auto pay. If you got auto pay, I give you a $5 discount we also have a promotion with Optimum Business Mobile um, now for you, um, do you have, um, a business, a business line, a business mobile?"" [Customer] ""No, I do not. I, I want a business line that is going to be in the store, but not like a mobile phone."" [Agent] ""Well, yeah, that is what you are going to have. Alright, well that is what you are going to have I am going to."" [Customer] ""So that is already in the XXX a month."" [Agent] ""Go ahead, I am sorry."" [Customer] ""What, what is that? That is one gig internet? That is a phone?"" [Agent] ""Now that is the that is the optionality if you are going to go with the landline it is going to be a couple more bunks if you are going to go with the mobile, uh, it will give you an additional discount, but let me add the uh landline to it. Let me see. I thought it was on there one second here. OK, so. Alright, so with the repackage promo with the phone and the internet, uh, failover, it is going to be $160 even, um, with auto pay would be XXX, um, and the installation, there is a one time installation of $100. Let us see here."" [Customer] ""So right now this include one route you guys what what do you install? You install a router a thing"" [Agent] ""So you are going to get everything so you are going to get a gateway router modem the tech is going to install everything so it is going to set up the connectivity uh for your POS systems, uh, for your cameras it is going to be set up with the gateway the router, the modem, uh, everything is going to be, uh, set up"" [Customer] ""Modem Is there a monthly charge for the equipment or is that already?"" [Agent] ""Nope, so we do not charge you for the, uh no, we do not charge you the, the equipment"" [Customer] ""Or not Yeah."" [Agent] ""Uh, the equipment is included in this bundle and the that is why the installation is just one time. We just charge you one time for the tech to come by and professionally set everything up you will be good to go Uh, there is no contract you can. Upgrade or make changes at any time and as your account manager I just ask that you email me directly so you do not have to call in if you need anything at all, even if it is not in my department, whether it is billing, whether it is technical support, just email me I will get you over there what I will do is I will send you a test email um you know if and when we finish up so this way you can you know you know how to reach me directly"" [Customer] ""Yeah. I am going to need something lower though. XXX is still too much."" [Agent] ""So you, the thing that"" [Customer] ""Honestly, I was thinking I mean I saw you guys were doing."" [Agent] ""Go ahead."" [Customer] ""The XXX meg Internet."" [Agent] ""The only thing is is that I do not, I do not think that that is sufficient for what you have because you have cameras you have POS systems"" [Customer] ""How much would that be?"" [Agent] ""Now if you have like one or the other, it, it would be possible. So I, you know, if you want the XXX, I can give you that. I just do not think that it, it is the best bet for you, uh, because of the POS systems and the camera systems you want. Customers to be able to complete transactions and if you have an issue with your POS system or they have an issue with their connectivity, especially with people using phones, people are just going to walk out. They are not going to wait on line um, you know, if you are having issues with the POS so I would rather, you know you keep the gig Um, versus the XXX, I just do not think the XXX is sufficient I mean you are the boss"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""If you want XXX, I will give it to you you can upgrade later on I just do not think it is sufficient for your set up unless this is like a really, really, really small space."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I mean, I want to have two routers set up so I want to I have a base the office is in the basement"" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""There is a basement space there is a opera level I am for it. Some have the internet, you know, set up on the the ground floor That is where the cameras and all the systems need. I am out of the office with the computer I am in basement, so I am going to need a second router Down there. How does that look?"" [Agent] ""So so that is what."" [Customer] ""I is there a charge for that?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, so they are going to charge you for that. What I would strongly recommend is that you keep it as is with the one gig we set it up and then you will be able to utilize it um with the cameras and if you are with your office. Now if you determine because again I am your manager I I check in with you every couple of weeks, you know, however your schedule permits it. If you determine that you need more, then we can certainly add another one in there, but the promotion that I am going to be able to give you, it does not come with a second modem. The second modem, they are going to charge you regular price which is like XXX, XXX right now. So I would recommend you take the gig because it is, it is the fastest, so it is going to be able to service all you have anyway. I do not think you will need to add with this. I, I am confident you are not going to need to. I would rather you do that then you get two different modems then you pay the additional cost when the gig, I am confident is going to resolve your situation"" [Customer] ""I would, if it is only one modem. You know I am talking about reaching Is it, you know, is they are going to reach that is what I am concerned about is the passion going to reach down to the basement."" [Agent] ""Well, that is my thing too. That is my thing too is I could do this another way. We could set up, set it up in two different places so I could give you. And then and and you let me know if this makes sense. If it is just for the cameras, I could set up this particular account right here just for the cameras and give you like the XXX and, you know, that would be lower or what I recommend is just keep this gig. And then I give you the XXX set up for the basement."" [Customer] ""No, I would rather just keep it all in one service."" [Agent] ""So then you would go with the gig then so that is uh I would recommend keeping the gig, right?"" [Customer] ""On one bill."" [Agent] ""And then if you want to add another modem, then we could always add another modem and we could work that out but I do not want you to pay for something that you do not need or pay for something, you know, if this will resolve it. Now if this is your, again this is your situation if you want I can add another modem right now, um just the XXX me adding that you are looking at instead of paying XXX Let me see here you are looking at. At least Let me see here. Because you were, you are more than you were more than triple I mean more than double your payment But to just go with the XXX, you are looking at an additional. So instead of paying XXX you would be paying XXX."" [Customer] ""So the, no, what is the price of the XXX megabit internet with two modems?"" [Agent] ""OK, so if you were to do it that way. Let me see here. Let us see here. OK, so if you were to do it the other way around, excuse me, you would be looking at like XXX, so you would, you would save like $40."" [Customer] ""So I What is the, has the more level is in the"" [Agent] ""Well that is what I am saying because you can not I am giving you because I am giving you a promo, so you can not get two promos at the same time"" [Customer] ""I do not understand."" [Agent] ""So, um, it is not charging you regular price like I am still and, and even with the second modem, I am still giving you a discount on that because. The regular price, that is, you know, that is why you are possibly not understanding the regular price um for these things. Is what you would be subjected to. So, you know, the XXX is, is XXX. No, it is actually 2:20."" [Customer] ""OK, so When you add a second modem, is there? Am I paying just for that extra modem like a one time fee is like the bill changed monthly"" [Agent] ""No, so that that is what I am saying the bill changes monthly. That is why I am recommending you just go with the gig at XXX and you feel it out because we could be X weeks in, X weeks in, and then, you know, Mr. Conn, you would be like, hey Ron, I want that other modem, and then we could just add it. But I, I would rather you, you know, utilize it first, the gig to confirm if that is viable for you. If you want to add another modem, I can certainly do that. It will be the same bill, same location, same everything. I am just not."" [Customer] ""But what if it is like a"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Like a router, you know, like the, the mesh connections. So it is all one Wi Fi service or internet. I just have. Different I I have a large space. I am not going to, you know if I have a XX,XXX square foot area I am not going to get XX different modems Right."" [Agent] ""Well, that, it depends. What people do is they would get like the pro Wi Fi and then they would get, um, which allows them to have an access point on each level. So an access point covers XXXX ft."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So if you had XX,XXX square feet, that would just be X access points, you know, X access points is like XXX on your bill. So I mean like even that, that is a solvable, that is a solvable situation like what you have is a solvable situation, it is just up to you how you want to solve it."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I, I really just want the same internet that is up, that is upstairs. I want it downstairs as well."" [Agent] ""OK, so that is where we are at right now with the XXXXs."" [Customer] ""So just what whether it is."" [Agent] ""And what I could do is what I could do, go ahead."" [Customer] ""And so this is like one mode, the pro Wi Fi you are talking about, what is that?"" [Agent] ""So the pro WiFi, that is what I was recommended to you before, but you said you are not going to share Wi Fi with your guests. Pro WiFi is a guest network. It allows you to give your customers their own internet, so it does not interfere with your internet. It does not interfere with your bandwidth and they access it based on your control so they can log in with an. They can log in by just clicking log in and then you determine how long they could be on there. You can let them be on there for X hour, X hours, XX hours indefinitely. And also people use that to market and advertise to their customers. You are collecting their emails you are collecting their phone numbers You could also send, you know, have that data and utilize that information to market and advertise, and it is relatively low. It is, it is much lower than marketing or advertising or what people pay for IT services. So, you know, you, I did not recommend it to you cause you said you do not want to share Wi Fi, but you could easily do that. You could get the gig you could get the pro Wi Fi You would be at like $200 monthly. There is a one-time install of like XXXXX you would be, you know, you would be good to go You know, I could possibly, uh you know, see if I can get you a discount on the install as well So you possibly be looking at just XXXX X time for the install. But um that is another option and that is actually the strongest option because you will have the one gig service to support the office, the cameras and things like that and you will also have that pro Wi Fi that is going to cover any uh any issues with your customers. Your customers are going to be able to log in and complete transactions. Everybody's using their phone nowadays to make a payment. So you know it is for you, it just depends. Do you want the, the X XXX setups you will be at XXX Um, or You know, like I said, the X gig promo, uh, that is going to give you that pro Wi Fi that is, that is $200 even."" [Customer] ""And but the pro Wi Fi is besides the. Because I do not, you know, the customers do not need access where I am at. I just need to be able to access the internet anywhere from my space. But that is what it is."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so I So that is why I think you are, you are really making the strongest argument for what you have the XXXXs, and because you would be a new customer and you are getting, you know, you would be getting two modems with us, I can definitely reach out to my supervisor to get a free install um with regards to the XXX, I think there may be that is what an auto pay option without auto pay it will be 3:30 um there may be, let me see if there is something I can do here."" [Customer] ""So I do not want to be in the basement then there is no connection I get the XXX service. With the phone And X routers, not X modems."" [Agent] ""Right. Let me see here."" [Customer] ""Well, I do not know if it is the same."" [Agent] ""Just Mhm."" [Customer] ""I have Verizon at home right now, and it is, I have two different routers. But it is like it is one service wherever I am in the house, it just connects."" [Agent] ""Right, it is and it is the same thing, so you are going to have two different routers with the same service and you are making that argument for that like you said, you do not want to go in the basement and not have service. You do not want to be in your office and not have service. So this is where, you know, we are going to make sure that you are able to have that, and that is going to be with this set up. You are going to have the phone, uh, you are going to and it is going to come with that fail over too, so the failover is going to, it is going to support that so you are going to be good to go with that. You are going to have the connectivity that you need. And you are at the base level of the XXX. So if at any time you wanted to go up, you could certainly do that. Do I think that this is more than enough or, you know, basically to resolve your situation, I think it is because it is, it covers you on the floor and then it comes you and it covers you above and you are not. Extending any bandwidth to your customers, so you should be good to go."" [Customer] ""Yeah, what is the price on that?"" [Agent] ""Um, you would be at 3:30. You would be at 3:30 even and that is what our auto pay with autopay you would be at 3:25, and if you got a mobile phone, uh, with us, you would be able to get an additional discount."" [Customer] ""But you said this is X services now."" [Agent] ""Right, exactly, you are going to have X modems."" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""Yes sir."" [Customer] ""I do not want some modems."" [Agent] ""OK, so what is it that you want then because I misunderstood on my bad."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I want One service, one bill. And I just want blanket coverage over my space."" [Agent] ""OK, so that was the"" [Customer] ""So the only actually thing that like,"" [Agent] ""Go ahead."" [Customer] ""The XXX service, it starts at what? What is the price for the XXX service?"" [Agent] ""So what are we talking now? We are talking one."" [Customer] ""Just a regular X."" [Agent] ""Go ahead."" [Customer] ""Just a regular XXX MB service. The regular internet service, one thing with the phone line. How much is that?"" [Agent] ""OK, one second here. Where did I go? OK, so you are looking at XXX. And it is actually, yeah, it is actually more than that one second here."" [Customer] ""It is uh"" [Agent] ""She just wanted the XXX."" [Customer] ""Yeah, uh, because when I saw it online, it was the reason I called is because I saw it at $60 a month, XXX service. I know that is just the internet."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so the $300 yeah, so it is $60 when you bundle it, it is $60 when you bundle it with something and based on what you said, sir, you know, we could give you that, that is not going to satisfy your situation at all."" [Customer] ""Uh, I would not expect it to jump up on price."" [Agent] ""Um, but yeah, I mean if that is what you want I could definitely set that up, um, you would just have to let me know what you are bundling it with, um, and I would definitely keep in contact with you because you, you are going to be calling back that is, you know, based on the conversation what you said, that is not even, not going to cut it."" [Customer] ""Mm Yeah, so. What would I have to bundle that with? Like a phone?"" [Agent] ""Well, I mean, whatever you want to, you know, whatever you want so you could bundle it with the phone, you could bundle it with TV, you know, it is whatever you wanted to bundle it with that is up to you."" [Customer] ""Yeah. Yeah, I want to bundle it with the phone ships."" [Agent] ""OK, alright, no problem. One second here. Alright, so just allow me a few moments. I am going to, uh, bundle this and give you the basic promo with the Internet and phone at the XXX and just, um, and like I said just keep in mind there is no contract so you know for whatever reason you want to upgrade or you know you realize that this is not sufficient just reach out to me and just email so you know I can get the tech out and we can get you what you need for the for the spot. Um, the only other thing I am going to need, because I am just waiting for everything to populate, I am going to need um."" [Customer] ""Yeah, that sounds good."" [Agent] ""An EIN or tax ID number and then I am going to need you to set up a X digit pin. Um, on the account, so, uh, I will let you know when things finished properly. It is just going to take a few more moments then you will be good to go"" [Customer] ""Got it. Let me you add in right now."" [Agent] ""Um, yes, sir. I am ready."" [Customer] ""Yeah it is XX. XXX. XXX X"" [Agent] ""OK, so that is XXX-XXX-XXX."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""Alright, so what is the X digit pin that you are going to create for your account?"" [Customer] ""We will make it XXXX."" [Agent] ""Alright, XXXX. I still have to feed into the system to just make sure, uh, Mr. Cons accepted you should be good though. Um, so the promo, uh, that you wanted, uh, you are bundling the, uh, XXX internet with the phone it is going to come with the gateway router modem. Uh, you are at $100 even that is without auto pay. There is a one time install of XXX bucks so you were able to take advantage of that internet, uh, basic Internet promo Now normally the promo is X year. I was able to modify that, so you are going to have a X year promo with this, so you are free to make changes at any time you are going to be, uh, price locked so you will be able to keep this for X years, right"" [Customer] ""OK, and then if I want to add anything on the future it is just. It is no problem."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so I am going to send you a test email if you need anything, even if it is not in my department I just try not to have people Mr. Con call in if you do not have to do that, you know, you are running a business, you, you know, you are supposed to have money coming in, and if you are on the phone, um, doing this and that, you know, you are not necessarily getting paid for that. So just email me when you need something and I will get it taken care of."" [Customer] ""That that sounds good."" [Agent] ""Uh,"" [Customer] ""And now, OK, so with this XXX service. It comes with one router, right?"" [Agent] ""Yep Now for you, go ahead."" [Customer] ""And so the monthly I mean, I am, I am paying for the installation cost There is nothing is there monthly equipment charges?"" [Agent] ""No, so you are not being charged with the equipment remember I told you, you know, we took care of that."" [Customer] ""OK, oK, got it.""

[Customer] ""Well, uh, Friday morning. OK."" [Agent] ""You are not paying into tech.

We can offer up to X gigabyte."" [Customer] ""Mm, but you are saying how much, uh, what is the XXX, XXX megabytes instead?"" [Agent] ""XXX megabytes per second."" [Customer] ""Mm. Yeah, see the same speeds up to a gigabyte. And they are saying that is within the price then I do not know why you are you are uh giving me options which are less"" [Agent] ""Mm. Let me see. No, I am not finding that account. What did you say the street name was?"" [Customer] ""Excuse me?"" [Agent] ""I am not finding your old account. What did you say the street name was?"" [Customer] ""XXX High Ridge Road. Stanford, Connecticut."" [Agent] ""And what is the business's name?"" [Customer] ""R Y Uh, pediatric urgent care."" [Agent] ""Oh there we go. Let me see. I am trying to see I thought we might have a special for customers that are coming back to us. So we can offer our X gig internet at $80."" [Customer] ""What about the $60?"" [Agent] ""The $60 is for our XXX MB internet."" [Customer] ""You think you do $50?"" [Agent] ""For one gig."" [Customer] ""Yeah, so that is what the party."" [Agent] ""Mm. So the flyer is telling you that we have speeds up to X gig, not that the X gig is $60."" [Customer] ""Yeah, that is fine. That is fine. We were customers for a long time with you guys then we canceled But I mean with an offer like that, we would, we would think about coming back."" [Agent] ""Let me see. Bear with me one second, I will put you on a brief hold."" [Customer] ""OK. I mean if if if I want to go hold on."" [Agent] ""Now beforehand when. I am sorry."" [Customer] ""Go ahead man."" [Agent] ""So before you looking at your account, you also had phones and static IPs with us. Would you be bringing those back as well?"" [Customer] ""Um, the, well, I do not know, uh, well, the, the, the, the problem we have with the phone was we had. The the first one. Aspect was was was absolutely untenable we could not get any support. Fa were getting forwarded and it was a nightmare. So the, you know, the, the, the functionality of the phones was, was, was this for we would rather not move back to you. We would rather if that is possible for now. So yeah, for now we are not going to be moving the phones just the internet"" [Agent] ""Would you be needing a static IP with that?"" [Customer] ""So I mean we try to come back here. Pardon?"" [Agent] ""Would you need a static IP with the internet?"" [Customer] ""I I do not, I do not that even means."" [Agent] ""So last time you had"" [Customer] ""Oh yeah, I do not know if we need one. Whatever we had last time works, so whatever that means."" [Agent] ""OK, so last time you did have static IPs with us."" [Customer] ""But ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, you, you are speaking a language. We are customers. You are saying, you are saying would you like to have, you know, uh, surgery that is done in this technique that technique, we are not, we are not doctors, you know, so you tell us what we forget That is what your customer service. So what do you recommend for us?"" [Agent] ""Do you know if you use any type of service or firewall?"" [Customer] ""The medical office So what did we have last time?"" [Agent] ""Like server So you did have static IPs with us as well."" [Customer] ""What did we have last time? Yeah, whatever we had last time is. So what, what we, we would be interested in doing what we had last time at a much lower price So like for example you said that the flyer that came in the mail said $60 a month for the first year and then up to one week like."" [Agent] ""I am sorry you are breaking up really bad on me"" [Customer] ""Uh, I am on the phone. Yeah, miss, yeah, I am just telling you we would be interested in doing everything we, we had the last time we just want to make sure if, if you are offering a price for us to come back to entice us to come back, we would come back that price has to be right, right So we want it to be $60 a month for the first year and speeds up to to a gigabyte. That that is when that is how we will come back, but we, we would keep everything the same as how it was last time. So if you are saying IT address and and if we have firewall protection like last time exactly like last time, nothing new then yes we would do it but if not then we are we are not going to do it."" [Agent] ""So the X gig internet runs $80 for our for the offer that we can make. I can offer you a $10 discount on there so I can offer it down to $70. That is the lowest I am able to get it down to with that, um, now, but adding a static IP on there the static IP runs $20 and I do have the ability to offer a different an additional discount So between the two. I can offer the static IP and the Internet at $80."" [Customer] ""That sounds great so. Right, hold on, I have a question. Uh, I am sorry, sir. Let me just ask. OK, so let us say we are in a billing cycle the speed is up to X gigabyte, right Can you confirm it is up to X gigabyte?"" [Agent] ""Yes, you would be getting the X gig internet."" [Customer] ""OK, great. So let me ask you this question. And within the billing cycle, is it possible that those states are not diminished or they or they are unlimited speed, uh, per gigabyte every single month, month after month?"" [Agent] ""It is unlimited."" [Customer] ""OK, I think I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I think what Andrew's asking is any data you need to limitate."" [Agent] ""No."" [Customer] ""OK. Um, what happens after the first year? How much can the bill be expected to go up after the first year?"" [Agent] ""So this is a X year price guarantee. After the X years you see an increase of around $30 to $40 then you are able to renegotiate your price"" [Customer] ""OK, and how does it work with uh equipment? You guys send all that equipment for free?"" [Agent] ""Um, so we would have to send out a technician to restart your equipment because it looks like you have returned all equipment."" [Customer] ""That is true, yes. So that the prices, yeah, because that, yeah, is that an extra cost or no?"" [Agent] ""So yes, there is a one time installation of XXX."" [Customer] ""Would you be able to waive that installation fee just knowing that we are coming back to you guys. I mean, I know that you are being, you are, you are being really nice to offer us a great deal to come back at the same time we have been the customers for a long time before being that loyal to come back, we would appreciate if maybe you guys could even waive that installation fee for us"" [Agent] ""I am just not sure about how many discounts I can apply on here since we are already bringing it down much lower than it originally is."" [Customer] ""Because now we will be with you guys for X years."" [Agent] ""Our X gig for new customers runs about $120. And so we have already lowered it $60."" [Customer] ""Well, I mean, I mean it is worth checking into."" [Agent] ""I can definitely ask my supervisor."" [Customer] ""I mean was checking into just considering. Alright, yeah, sure, if, if you would not mind that'd be really helpful because like I said, we are, we are coming back and now not only be coming back we are, we are, we plan on staying with you guys for X plus more years"" [Agent] ""OK. OK, give me X 2nd."" [Customer] ""And then you get month after month payment. OK, thank you. Having, having an executive committee is crazy."" [Agent] ""OK, you there?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, hi, how are you?"" [Agent] ""Hi, so my supervisor wanted to ask what are y'all doing about your mobile services for the business?"" [Customer] ""Uh, we would not, I am sorry we would not be interested in the mobile Thank you so much though."" [Agent] ""Cause I mean with our Optimum mobile services even just like looking into it today we would be able to offer that free installation um as well as I mean with you getting the services at just $80 monthly you would see a $40 discount with bundling, so it would bring your monthly total down to just $40 monthly for the internet."" [Customer] ""That is fine. I, I mean we are we are comfortable with with our mobile now No, no, yeah, I can not, I can not change mobile because my son's in the military."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""We have a military discount. So we have an incredible deal on our on our mobile services because I am not going to change it. We, we have a military, the phones are through the military."" [Agent] ""I mean we can we have the ability to offer lines at $25 a piece depending on how many lines you are offering like and so I mean we we do have that as well as unlimi talk text with data and then it is on our T-Mobile network so it is on one of the largest networks available."" [Customer] ""Yeah At this point now, um we are very busy. We really want to restate your internet, you know we will think about everything in the future right now we want to get the internet back on"" [Agent] ""OK, give me one second then."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I think that, I mean, yeah, but, but, and, and how about also, you know, just knowing that look, we are coming back, we are going to be paying month over month payments to optimum as new as once again customers. I mean it would be great just to have that technician come again and and do the installation for free knowing that we had to return the boxes and go through all of that just to return the boxes. I mean, It is just what we would really appreciate if the if the person can come out here and just just do it, take care of it up for us and not having to pay that again because if you think about it we got to pay that once before now we are going to have to pay it again. So so it would just be"" [Agent] ""Because we are having to reestablish services we are still having to send out our technician and pay our technician to come and install the equipment at the location so I definitely get where you are coming back, where you are coming back to us, and we are honoring that with giving you a discount on our one gig which brings it down. A lot lower than what a new customer would even pay with us and so I mean I am just making sure we can apply all of the discounts that are being needed like that you are requesting on the account because we do we do have to pay our technician and things along that line to come out to the business."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I know. I listen, I understand all that mess, and I I do respect the technician's time and effort, but look, I, I mean, we have been customer for you guys before We are going to be paying a lot more money. You are going to get all that money back, uh, and then some based on monthly payments and month over month. Um, you guys can make an exception just to, you know, not have, not charge us for that amount."" [Agent] ""Let me see, I am waiting on a response from my supervisor."" [Customer] ""Alright thanks I really appreciate that because look, I mean you guys made a lot, a lot of money just based on month over month payments again."" [Agent] ""But we are, like I said already cutting the price in half with our X gig. We are offering you the X gig at half the price of what a customer pays a regular customer would pay coming into us so I mean we are applying a lot of discounts on here to win you back to us so I am just verifying that we can, we can waive the installation"" [Customer] ""Alright, thank you. I appreciate you making the effort to find that out for us."" [Agent] ""OK, so we did get approval to go ahead and waive the installation and it looks like I can send out a technician on Friday the 16th between X and XX."" [Customer] ""I, uh, that was that you are amazing by the way, um, and I really appreciate you doing that on our behalf. So you said on Friday the at what time?"" [Agent] ""I have an X to XX on Friday the 16th."" [Customer] ""Dude, does that work for you? I got to check my schedule. Give me one second. I could be, yes. Um, And they will set everything up because because we have we have fax line we have everything so they will be able to make sure that it is all working well."" [Agent] ""So now this does not have any."" [Customer] ""Well, the, the fact finding stuff."" [Agent] ""Yeah, this has no phones."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, you are already set up for that. I, I, I am confused, OK. So the phone service is this like right right now also the, the Wi Fi in the back office, it does not reach there. Is there any way they can bring some kind of duplicator or some kind of uh extender, or do I have to buy that on my own?"" [Agent] ""Um, so we do not offer any type of extenders to our business unless it is what we call pro Wi Fi, which is a guest network but also extends up to XXXX square foot. Um, if you are wanting any type of like small little extender, you would purchase it yourself."" [Customer] ""OK, so I could buy like like from Google or whatever like that and that would, that would go through."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Uh, I, I have an ethernet cable in the back that would go to the Ethernet cable and then the ether that is fine. I, I will talk to my, my, OK. Alright, um, so that that is something I could talk to someone else about I guess, right Do it, do it, do it um independently."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""OK, alright, so I could be there at XX, yes."" [Agent] ""And do you have a number you want us to call before we show?"" [Customer] ""Yes, my cell phone XXX. XXXXXXX"" [Agent] ""OK, so I have got you scheduled for Friday the 16th between X and XX to get our X gig package. It is a X year price guarantee that does include our static IPs at just $80 monthly with no installation charge."" [Customer] ""Thank you so much really appreciate it."" [Agent] ""Yes sir, we appreciate you calling. We hope you have a wonderful rest of your day."" [Customer] ""Thank you very much. I really appreciate it. Thank you so much."" [Agent] ""Thank you."" [Customer] ""Take care. Alright, thank you, Andrew. I will talk to you later. Thank you so much. That is everything I was after. OK, thank you so much. Awesome. Take care.

Call176,"[Agent] ""Thank you for calling Optimum now offering Optimum Mobile. This is Sam from the commercial sales department. How may I be of assistance?"" [Customer] ""Hi. Um, Hold on one second, I am just trying to get back to where our account is. OK, we currently have a business account with you we are doing business internet only We had switched to Verizon for phone service quite some time a little while ago. Um, and I am just interested to see what options you guys have if we were to come back for phone service."" [Agent] ""OK, can you confirm the business name and address please?"" [Customer] ""Yes, so the business is Pinnacle Press LLC."" [Agent] ""And the address please just to confirm."" [Customer] ""XXXX Post Road. XDX Fairfield, Connecticut XXXXX and our phone number is XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Agent] ""May I have your name so I can address you properly, please?"" [Customer] ""My name is Nicole."" [Agent] ""Thank you, Nicole. The phone number that I have here that you are calling from ends in XXXX. Would that be the best number to call you on that just in case we get disconnected?"" [Customer] ""That would be fine."" [Agent] ""OK perfect thank you so I have XXX-XXXXXXX OK. Right now I am just going into your account. And we will discuss the different types of phone services that we have and then hopefully we can find something that meets your needs. Do you recall the X digit access code for the account?"" [Customer] ""Um, oh, good lord."" [Agent] ""If you have a bill nearby, it should be towards the top of your bill if you have a recent one."" [Customer] ""Um, Oh, OK, hold on, I do have XX, XXXX."" [Agent] ""Do not put me on the stand so they may say I let the witness, but."" [Customer] ""Yes, oh my God, thank God, you know, because I was trying to pull up our bills, so I am like looking at and like to see we are having such problems with Verizon, so like it is, it is so frustrating."" [Agent] ""OK, well, I am sorry that you are having trouble I am glad that you are giving us a call"" [Customer] ""So, Yeah."" [Agent] ""Hopefully we will have the opportunity to earn your business back so talk to me about phone numbers."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Can you advise me how many phone numbers you have in total, please?"" [Customer] ""Um, Well, we have right now we have the one main line which is XXX-XXX-XXXX. And I think what we would like to do is simplify back to just that because. I, I think that The problem is that what is confusing is when we switch to Verizon then we added a line in each desk we are not the the physical space that we are a big business but the physical space that we are in is not big and managing this hunt group and all of this stuff is not, it is just it is too difficult."" [Agent] ""May I, may I ask a question, um, to see if I can maybe guide myself a little bit towards what you may need."" [Customer] ""Um, Yeah."" [Agent] ""How many people do you have in the office that are actually slated to pick up calls?"" [Customer] ""Right, like it is that is the thing like it is a printing we own a printing company, so it is not really like just it is whoever is getting the phone does that make sense? Like someone's answering the calls like you know my my wife and I own the company um she primarily is doing the selling, so she primarily answers the phone."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Um, but it is, and then we have another kid who works another gentleman who works for us who deals with a lot of customers and so with Verizon they did have separate lines but what we are looking to do is just go back to a single. Line with a virtual receptionist."" [Agent] ""So basically, if you only have one phone number you can only be on one phone call at a time"" [Customer] ""Right, but there is call waiting."" [Agent] ""But once again, you can only be on one phone call at a time. Like if let us say somebody calls in the XXXX phone number, that call waiting is going to beep and then that person you press flash, you go to the second person, you take care of the second person plus flash you come back to the other line That, that is literally what that is. It does not, if you have a virtual receptionist, the calls are not going to go anywhere because you only have that XXXX. You would have to have at least two phone numbers and what a virtual receptionist does is basically it guides the customers."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Um, thank you for calling Pinnacle Press Hour of operations and location press one for, um, you know, for orders press X for billing. Press X and behind those numbers are whatever phone numbers you want to call to go to whether it is um the gentleman's cell phone, whether it is your wife's um desk number you know it could be that but it would still be a phone number. Having just one line does not give you multiple extensions per se."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So we can simplify it to maybe X lines where the first line is busy to roll over to the second so that way you can be on at least X phone calls at any given time because so far it seems like there is just X of you in the office."" [Customer] ""OK. Yeah, it is just their system was so complicated to figure out and it keeps going out like it keeps literally going out like the service keeps going out and when I go on to um."" [Agent] ""Mm."" [Customer] ""The platform there I am just going to like just speak to uh like the the the platform that to manage it is very difficult. Um, hard for me to step in. It was hard for me to step in and learn it. Um, a previous person had purchased it. It is extremely expensive, um."" [Agent] ""Wow."" [Customer] ""And We need phones that we can be able to walk around with. And when it is set up this way it is like so my wife has her own voicemail that she has to check and then Anthony has his own voicemail that he has to check and then there is a separate mailbox that needs to be checked too many different voicemails that need to be checked every day. And so we are missing calls if that makes sense we are missing those messages because we are just too busy like no one can check all those messages."" [Agent] ""OK, can I a moment for the just too busy. That is a good problem to have."" [Customer] ""Yeah, thank you, yeah, like we are facing our business, yeah, thank you, yeah, yeah, so, um."" [Agent] ""Just a moment for that statement right there. Now that we can now we can put that to the side and let us go ahead and continue to find solutions for you."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""So if it makes you feel any better or any more comfortable, our Optimum voice service like you had it before, has not changed. It is the same optimum voice service if you have already a username and password with our platform, it is the same one."" [Customer] ""OK. Yeah."" [Agent] ""There is nothing that you really have to relearn."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Because it is that same platform, it is our same web portal. Like I see that the phones left back in like the phone number left I guess back like in December of XXXX, so maybe a year and a half now we will say that you have been on this different phone system so not that we do not go ahead and continue to work on our services it is just."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""That this is pretty much established, you know what I am saying? XX calling features voice, you know, it is optimum voice."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""You picked the phone, so if you want to purchase like DJs or staples, you want to purchase a two line cordless phone with a couple of handsets, that is fine. That is as simple as it needs to be. does not really need to be more complicated than that. I could just give you the downtown and that'll be all. Just like you had it before, give you two phone numbers."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""If you have X phone numbers with them and you want us to support the X phone numbers, then I can take care of that. If you have one number that you want to keep and you want us to generate a second number for you, that is fine. Um, if I am not mistaken, it seems like we only port it out one line. So maybe if you are a little bit busy you might benefit from having that second line the way that the voicemail works is if somebody calls the first line It goes from the first line, that line is busy, it goes to the 2nd line. If the second line is busy, then it goes to voicemail on line X. That is it."" [Customer] ""OK, so there is only one voicemail box."" [Agent] ""If somebody There is only one voicemail box. Let us say for our human's sake that that second phone number that you give, that I am sorry, the 2nd phone number that we gave you for the rollover number. If you give that number out to somebody, if they call that number directly and you act and there is a whole bunch of ants, and you activate a voicemail on that one, then somebody can leave a voicemail on it. But normally what you would do is that you would just Um, advertise your primary number. There is no reason for you to advertise that second number."" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""So if nobody knows that second number, nobody's calling you directly nobody's leaving voicemails on that end"" [Customer] ""OK, alright."" [Agent] ""So as long as it is, it is, it is keeping it kind of you know, very simplistic, which in this case seems to be the goal"" [Customer] ""Um, OK, yeah. Yeah, and we could just go and buy whatever phones we want to use, right?"" [Agent] ""As long as they are regular phones in the sense of like not ethernet jacks."" [Customer] ""OK, not."" [Agent] ""They are regular phones like the optimum voice phones or regular phones, meaning on the back of the modem, you can even look at the modem that you have right now. You will see a port X, a port X most likely, and you will see that it is just a regular phone jack. You will not see an Ethernet jack X, which is the X prog. You will see a X-prong, which is the traditional phone phone jack. Now, if you want Optimum to provide you physical phones and you want to do, you know, a more, not necessarily complex but more robust phone system with a different platform and everything, we do offer a voice over IP option, but that sounds similar to what you have right now, although I am very happy to say that ours does work. Um, it seems like you are trying to step away from that."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""So yes, you can go to Best Buy, you can go to PC Richards if they are still around. Sorry, I just hate myself. Um, you can go to Staples, Office Max, wherever he wants, get like, you know a cordless phone"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""You can get a cordless phone with a few handsets that you can just plug into the back of the modem and the other ones get electricity you are ready to roll"" [Customer] ""OK, OK, and that, that, yeah, OK, so that makes sense and then um. And then so with the virtual receptionist. That just links to the voicemail, right? That is part of the voicemail service."" [Agent] ""Actually, the virtual receptionist is um something a little different than voicemail. Virtual reception is is a call routing system. So basically you tell the system this is where I want the calls to go. Um, when they press X, when they press XXX, whatever the case may be."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Once it goes to that, let us say that you use uh your wife's cell phone as the phone number for orders. If it goes, it once it, once it goes into your wife's cellphone, if they leave a message, it will be on her phone."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Because the call was directed at your discretion was directed to her voicemail, meaning it was directed to her cell phone, so she will pick up that call there where she wants to go ahead and just let it go to voicemail, she can do it."" [Customer] ""OK, alright, so first of all, receptionist, OK, um, how much is."" [Agent] ""Yeah, it is literally just a yeah it is literally just the call routing system. You keep it for as long as you you keep on listening."" [Customer] ""OK, and then one would go so you could have, you know, press X for direction, press X for you know our website information, press X for store hours, press X to speak to a customer service, whatever, right?"" [Agent] ""You are going to ask a question, sorry. Yeah, you go ahead and decide you you go ahead and decide what the options you wanted to be behind those numbers are you also have the opportunity to decide what is getting"" [Customer] ""Something like that."" [Agent] ""You know where it is, you know, where it is routed to so that is literally all it is and that is all managed from the web portal."" [Customer] ""OK, got it. OK, um, alright, so just, so I am trying to figure out what my next question needs to be here."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""All right, um."" [Agent] ""What is the price?"" [Customer] ""We have, uh, so we have, yeah, I need the price I also like, when we went to Verizon, we bought all their fancy phones That is the other thing, like, I do not know how to use the phone. I do not know how to hang it up. We have to stay at the desk with these phones. There is no handsets that move around and we are an active print shop, you know, with machines running and stuff and so like that is it is been a big problem, um, and like my payoff is."" [Agent] ""Mhm. That sounds very restrictive."" [Customer] ""Yeah it is it is the whole thing has been just just the whole thing um uh we have like a payoff to get out of our contract you guys work with that or?"" [Agent] ""I could check, but based on the fact that we are just porting over one phone number and for the discounts that we are providing you, I, I do not know how deep that that discount that, um, early termination fee refund would be."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""I could check for you, but I do not expect it to be um very high, and by the way, we do not have any contracts or cancellation charges."" [Customer] ""OK, yeah, alright."" [Agent] ""So let me take a look."" [Customer] ""Um, And I am assuming that the phones that I have from them that I will not be able to use, is that right?"" [Agent] ""If they are, and they do sound like they are, if they are voice over IP phones, I do not think that would be the case."" [Customer] ""That they are not going to work, yeah."" [Agent] ""No, I do not think that would be the case because they sound like voice over IP phones."" [Customer] ""Uh Yeah, so frustrating. Um, OK, so tell me then, uh, what is the price, uh, what would, what what is your, what is the price"" [Agent] ""OK, so did you want me to, I am going to go ahead and quote it to you, my apologies. I am going to go ahead and quote it to you with two phone numbers for the, uh, virtual receptionist in there."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""OK, so for me in a couple of seconds."" [Customer] ""Yeah, oh, and we do have internet with you guys too so."" [Agent] ""Yes, of course it will be added on to that account. I am actually working. On a pricing structure for a bundle per se. Did they tell you what your early termination fee might be?"" [Customer] ""No, not yet. I was calling you first and then."" [Agent] ""OK, just wondering."" [Customer] ""And just to call them."" [Agent] ""Just wondering, OK, so just sit tight for me a couple of seconds and I will give you the pricing structures all together. So I apologize. I think I know the answer, but I just want to go ahead and get it with certainty. How many phone numbers do you have with them right now?"" [Customer] ""Um, we have. Uh, I am just looking at the devices. I have got X devices. And we have Um, Hold on. I If he is not there. OK. Uh Um, Let me just go. I think I have XX lines. I think I have X, I have X lines then the main line Does that make sense?"" [Agent] ""So that is fine."" [Customer] ""So there is the main line and then that that spawns off into the three other lines."" [Agent] ""So total of X, OK. Do you, do you mind if I ask how much you are paying for your services with them?"" [Customer] ""I, I, I think. Uh, Um Oh, let me find where my bill is here. Um Um Insanity just because you can not even find the the bell like it is just."" [Agent] ""Yeah, well, at the end of the month, how much are you paying altogether like taxes and all that fun because I am about to go ahead and give you that price altogether so I just want to make sure that we are comparing apples to apples as well"" [Customer] ""Uh-huh. Yeah, you know what, I can not, it is um. Mm. It is really bad that you can not even log in and see what your bill is, right? Like, I do not. Um, Sorry."" [Agent] ""Do not be sorry, you are giving me the opportunity to go ahead and work on your rates, so you are making me look real efficient, OK, because by the time you find your, by the time you find your codes, I am going to pretty much be done with mine and I will be like, that is great."" [Customer] ""OK good I am sorry. I, uh"" [Agent] ""This is the this is what I can do. Do not tell my secret though on this recorded conversation."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I know. I just. Um, so we can go. Mhm Mhm. OK. Here we go. Alright, so it is. X XXXXX."" [Agent] ""So at the end of the month, you pay for everything that you have with them XXXXX including taxes, is that correct?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, so yeah, taxes are XXX, surcharges $19.90 equipment charges XXXX. Monthly charges $95."" [Agent] ""OK, perfect."" [Customer] ""Yeah, XXXX."" [Agent] ""So about X, they basically XXX. So right now overall, let us see, so you are at XXX on this end and XXX on the other, you are at XXX."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Overall on your services, OK, so let us see what."" [Customer] ""And, and I, I have a payoff on these phones like of $348.30 but I still owe them. I just calculated my payoff on the equipment with them."" [Agent] ""OK, so as far as my pricing is concerned. Um, I am including. An upgrade on your internet speed. Like right now, you have a promotion on your XXX speed that is slated to end in December."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""Because you had a you got a XX month promo, so that is $65 just slated to end in December, so that $175."" [Customer] ""OK. Mhm."" [Agent] ""would go up by XX to XXX. So what I am basically doing is extending a promotion, upgrading it to a gig speed of service, so you have faster speed. So you know, with printing you are always downloading information, pictures and things of the sort. So anything that could make you more efficient would be better. Um, I am including the two phone numbers, your modem, your router, your premier technical support, a connection failover service, um, for the off chance that maybe our main internet is down, it will go ahead and bring your. Um, you will be able to go ahead and have your main internet service, um, working, um, on that end, um, the pricing structure that I am creating for you without any contracts or cancellation charges would be a X year promotion. You have been a valued customer of ours for a few years now. More than a few years, I am seeing almost XX, almost XX years now at this point at this location."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So the system is allowing me to go ahead and extend that and pass the normal X years to a X year promotion. So it is something that you can kind of settle in and be OK with for any reason you need to switch out, you need to retire, you guys won the lottery, you are going to go off to see the world, feel free"" [Customer] ""Uh-huh. Very much, yeah, that would be great."" [Agent] ""You know, um, just connect your services, you, that is it, you are good to go. Um, our pricing structure, including the, um, virtual receptionist would be $315 your taxes would be about $11 So you are pretty much staying within the pricing structure that you are in now you are doubling your internet speed That is one. You have your virtual receptionist."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""You have your two phone numbers you also have that connection fail over service The connection fail over service in case the main internet goes down automatically switches over to that LTE service. So basically it connects through the cell towers in the area so that if you do have any issues, um. While we are connecting, you will still be able to get online because you will have that field over service that will connect your six main devices. So that once again would be a total of $300. I apologize. I do not know why I think I might have said $315. So it is $300 plus the, I would say $11 in taxes."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""So if you are doing the math of what you are paying right now, you are paying $175 plus the $145 you are about $320."" [Customer] ""Around"" [Agent] ""In this case, you would be at XXX plus XX, you would be around XXX, and remember that price is good for X years, no contract and no cancellation charges. I looked at the calculator and I put in like, you know, just to put in a random figure, I put in that you would need $500 towards an early termination fee and the maximum that it approved and I would note the account is $351. So if you get an early termination fee from your existing provider, you can email it to um business ETF business early termination fee very aptly um chosen by our team at optimum.com."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""You submit your final bill with that you put a circle on your early termination fee You put your account number you put your phone number on the X to X weeks, you get a check We pay you, you pay them."" [Customer] ""OK, OK, so if they, so if like my payoff for my um. Equipment or whatever if they put that as an early termination fee."" [Agent] ""I can only say whatever the early termination fee. What is there, they will make that determination, you know, it is, it is, I do not want to say, yeah, sure, they will cover everything, you know, put your, put yesterday's dinner on you."" [Customer] ""OK, OK."" [Agent] ""It has to be under that early termination fee kind of situation."" [Customer] ""Mm OK, and you said it would be X XXX."" [Agent] ""So, um, it would approve up to up. XXX is exactly what they gave me when I put in the request for $500."" [Customer] ""X XXX, OK."" [Agent] ""So if it, so if, so let us say for you say that your early termination fee happens to be $200 you will get $200."" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""If your early termination fee happens to be $400 you will get $351 just so we are clear."" [Customer] ""OK. Got it. OK."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""um, can, can you email this to me or are you, how do you do this?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, when this is, well, I would not email it to you when the system, when you, when we process the order in just a few moments, the system will go ahead and send you an email confirmation to the email on record, and if you need me to update it, I will update it as well. But the system sent you that email."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Once we process the order, so yeah."" [Customer] ""OK, um."" [Agent] ""Yeah, the install for the phone numbers to be ported over is 79.99. That is a one time charge, and that is basically all, yeah, that is basically all there is to it."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK. Oh, so we have to pay a port charge, OK."" [Agent] ""Well, the technician has to go out there to install the services whether we were going out there to install new numbers or you were reporting them, that price that I just gave you includes everything, meaning the port request, the port charges, and the technician going out there to install it would be XXXX."" [Customer] ""Right. OK, OK."" [Agent] ""Yeah, any swapping out, any swapping out of equipment to upgrade you to the gig speed of service, there is no charge for that. There is no charge to install the connection failover service also includes the premier technical support if you need any assistance with networking past the demarcation point you let us know Trouble calls are included within the premier tech. support. So basically you are, you are in XXXX with Optimum at this point, you know, you are getting the top speed, you are getting our traditional optimum voice service which you were familiar with before, you know, and hopefully worked to your liking for the past XX years until, you know, something changed, so."" [Customer] ""OK, alright, um, OK, can I, do you have like a certain extension that I can call you back at, or, um, I just, I."" [Agent] ""No, unfortunately we are in a call center so we do not have direct extensions. I mean, is there a possibility that I hold for you while you speak to your wife?"" [Customer] ""Um, I do not think so. Like, I, I need to call Verizon, so I have to just like I want to call them and just see if um. Like what I was calling you first to get the information um and then I need to call them."" [Agent] ""And just said I mean keep in mind that because we are reporting the same phone number you would not go ahead and cancel services with them."" [Customer] ""And see what Yeah."" [Agent] ""We would request the phone number on your behalf. In fact, that is a big no no. We definitely ask you not to call them to cancel it. You can speak to them, of course, because they are your service provider, but just do not cancel the services because if you do then we can not keep the phone number That is a really bad thing."" [Customer] ""Right, yeah, no, of course, yeah, yeah, and then we would schedule the."" [Agent] ""Mhm"" [Customer] ""We would schedule you when we wanted you to come, right?"" [Agent] ""That is correct, yes, and normally it would be about like today is the 13th."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Under normal circumstances it would probably be around the 21st, 22nd, or 23rd, depending on what port um date it gives me."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And that is under normal circumstances that kind of situation"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So you have plenty of time to reach out to them and you know with Optimum that if you set up an appointment and for any reason you decide against it, you can just cancel the appointment."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""I mean, I do not want my hard work to. To go in vain, but if you wanted to cancel it, you can go ahead and cancel the whole thing."" [Customer] ""Yeah, oK."" [Agent] ""I just want you to feel comfortable with what it is that you are doing so that you can go ahead and move forward with what we are, what we are talking about."" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""You can call and get all your ducks in a row, T's dot T's crossed, I dotted all that fun stuff and feel comfortable with what you are doing and say, OK, I did make a good decision"" [Customer] ""Yeah, OK, so just can you just go through this with me one more time."" [Agent] ""I mean you are going to, yeah, yeah."" [Customer] ""So it is, it is XX phone lines, X phone lines."" [Agent] ""Yeah, absolutely."" [Customer] ""Um, the virtual. Receptionist. Um, the, um. Uh, the XXX speed you said on the internet?"" [Agent] ""It is actually being doubled to one gig."" [Customer] ""OK, XX, OK, one gig."" [Agent] ""Mhm. So XXX megs, so XXX megs is the equivalent of XXXX megs, but when you go to XXXX megs, it is then stated as X gig."" [Customer] ""One gig So, OK, so we are upgrading to one gig of. Internet"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""And, and, um, and it is good for X years."" [Agent] ""Correct without any contracts or cancellations."" [Customer] ""No contract. Or Cancellations right and um. We can email for or we. Early termination payback of up to $351 and our total bill."" [Agent] ""Yep, and that email if you like just to go ahead so that you have all your books in a row together that email address is business"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah."" [Agent] ""ETF"" [Customer] ""Yes. It is"" [Agent] ""And an early termination fee."" [Customer] ""EXF, uh-huh."" [Agent] ""At Optimum.com."" [Customer] ""At Mm OK. OK, and we have to pay a XXXX."" [Agent] ""That could spelled out."" [Customer] ""Install fee, OK, and it is our bill would be about XX X no I am sorry $311 per month, right?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, right now I am, yeah, right now I am seeing $300 for the services the taxes are about $11"" [Customer] ""OK. OK, OK, can you give me just one second? I am just going to call her, OK?"" [Agent] ""I will give you, well we have been on the phone for maybe about, exactly"" [Customer] ""XX XX minutes, yeah."" [Agent] ""So if you, if, if you need more than a second, you have it."" [Customer] ""OK, OK, um, yeah, so I have to actually hold. I am working from home today she is in the office, so just I am going to just"" [Agent] ""Yeah, so just go right ahead and if we get disconnected, I have the XXXX, no worries, take your time."" [Customer] ""I OK, yes, you can call me back. OK. All right. Hold on."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""Wait, tell me your first name again?"" [Agent] ""Sandra, S A N D R A."" [Customer] ""And um, OK, hold on, alright, hold on."" [Agent] ""Thank you. No worries."" [Customer] ""Oh wait, in fact, I wonder if you could just add her. Let me just see if I can add her. Maybe I can add her. Oh, Sandra?"" [Agent] ""I am still here."" [Customer] ""Hello. Oh, you are still there? OK, OK, my wife Cheryl, she is on the phone."" [Agent] ""So Hi, Cheryl."" [Customer] ""Hey Sandra, how are you?"" [Agent] ""I am great."" [Customer] ""Hi, thank you so much."" [Agent] ""I am great. Thank you for joining the call."" [Customer] ""I know you guys. Good. OK, so tell me, what, what do you have? I kind of told her, but Sandra, can you just you explain it so much better than I can. I like rambled through so can you just tell her what we spoke about"" [Agent] ""Yes, of course. So, uh, Nicole was expressing to me the fact that you guys have a Verizon phone system that is maybe not the easiest to work with."" [Customer] ""Thank you."" [Agent] ""It is maybe failing you guys a little bit you had Optimum Voice with us for the better part of about XX years, so you are hoping to maybe revisit Um, seeing what we can do for you as far as phone service, and I was very grateful to Nicole for doing that and giving me the opportunity."" [Customer] ""Correct, yes."" [Agent] ""So our optimum voice service since December of XXXX that you ported out has not really changed. It is still the same unlimited local, regional and long distance in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico with over XX calling features that you had. So it is the same service, it is still a great quality service, no issues there, so you are familiar with the product. So what I did was trying to go ahead and put a package together for you that made sense price wise or incentivizing additional services that would make it worth your time. So if you are looking at your monthly rate right now from the two accounts, meaning what you have with Verizon and what you have with us, your monthly rates about XXX."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""I came up with the price of XXX with a X year promotion without any contracts or cancellation charges. That would include an upgrade that doubles your internet speed to a gig speed of service, that would include your modem, your router, premier technical support your connection failover service"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""X phone numbers so you still have that main number and the capability to be on a 2nd phone call independently so that you could still remain efficient and also the virtual receptionist, virtual receptionist is a call routing system where basically the customer calls into your main line. You can go ahead and set up the call routing systems to say thank you for calling printing press for hours of operation and location press X for orders press X for pickups, press X, and behind those options you decide where to go. You can leave a voicemail you can leave a."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Message after you know after they press one location and time orders could go to your cell phone pickups can go to the gentleman that works with you ladies, you know what I mean? So you guys decide that because you are and it is all on the same platform that you already have access to, so it is not something new that you have to learn or anything like that."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK, oK."" [Agent] ""And as far as the phones. I was just aging myself with Nicole telling her she can go to PC Richards, Best Buy BJ's and just get like nice simple cordless cordless phones because one of the other pain points was the fact that you can not move around"" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""And it seems like that is an issue because you guys, you know, have to be very mobile in your, in your office space."" [Customer] ""Correct. Right."" [Agent] ""So taking those things into consideration, that would be, you know, the best solution and just just regular phones with regular phone jacks on the back of the modem, you will just be able to plug in the main base you can plug in the other phones around the office kind of situation The installation would be XXXX and that would include the porting charge and the technician going to the location to install the phones."" [Customer] ""OK. OK."" [Agent] ""There is no charge for anything else as far as swapping out the equipment for the faster speed, the connection failover, none of that, that is all, you know, that is all there. So you are not increasing your monthly rate, you are definitely increasing your speed and you are coming back to something which you were familiar with that you knew worked."" [Customer] ""OK, and can you help us out with the buyout for the phones for from Verizon?"" [Agent] ""Oh yes, my apologies, yes, she mentioned that and I mentioned the calculator, um, it was XXX, um, that the system based on what you are bringing in, that is what we could assist you with according to the calculator."" [Customer] ""I put"" [Agent] ""So basically she has the information where you would just go ahead and email the early termination fee. Department, um, you would include your for your last month's bill with them. You circle early termination fee, name, phone number, account number, and send it over in X to X weeks. We basically cut you a check and I said clearly say it to her, basically we pay you, you pay them. We have nothing to do with them."" [Customer] ""Got it. OK."" [Agent] ""Yeah, how did I do, Nicole?"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""How was that recap?"" [Customer] ""Um, That is great. That was good. Oh, that was very good."" [Agent] ""OK. Perfect."" [Customer] ""Amazing. That sounds great."" [Agent] ""Mhm Um, I mean, by the end of the phone call you will know exactly what date it is."" [Customer] ""Um, that is fine. That is good with me baby you, Nicole, yeah. Yeah, yeah, it is good and then she said that um once she puts the order through then they will give us the scheduled date so it is not like this is happening tomorrow like I think it would be like when Sandra like next week you said? Mm."" [Agent] ""It is just I just have to get to the calendar page that is all."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so it would probably be some normally it would be about somewhere around between the 21st 2nd, the 23rd, that kind of thing is what, you know most likely the system would provide me"" [Customer] ""Um, what do you think, honey? OK, so yeah, whatever the day it is, that is what it is, and let us do it. OK, alright, yeah, very good, we are good, yep, OK, alright, Sandra, so go ahead."" [Agent] ""OK, perfect, not a problem."" [Customer] ""Um, Yeah."" [Agent] ""So I know the phone number that we are keeping is that the most important one is that XXXX. Did you want me to generate a new number for you is there another phone number you would like for me to port It there is no difference in cost."" [Customer] ""Oh, so there."" [Agent] ""It does not take any more effort. You just tell me how you would like for me to answer it. If you do not have another phone number that you want me to forward, then I can just have the system generate another one for you."" [Customer] ""OK. Hold on one sec, I think what we will do is, um, let me just see if I can get that number that is yours share from your, um, your lane do you just want to start again I think we should start again. I mean this is like a XXX number, yeah, just that is fine because no one has it. It only rolls over to it, so it is no like the XXXX."" [Agent] ""OK, no problem. Not sad lady."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK, yes, so the primary Sandra is that XXX-XXXXXXX. That is the one that we advertise and then the, the second one, let us just give us a new one, yeah."" [Agent] ""Perfect. The system will generate perfect, OK. Um, who is going to sign the yellow, the letter of about XX, will it be Unico, will it be Cheryl?"" [Customer] ""Um, it could be either one or it does not, uh, I can do it."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so I will just put it I am going to call."" [Customer] ""I, I call her that, yeah, she can do that, yep, yep."" [Agent] ""OK, Nicole, can I have your last name please, dear?"" [Customer] ""Um, it is Yanni, Y A N N I E H."" [Agent] ""Perfect, thank you. How long have you ladies been together, if you do not mind me asking I apologize if I am being too um dangerous"" [Customer] ""No, XX years. Oh, yes, XX lovely, wonderful years."" [Agent] ""I I well, I see the interaction I see the respect"" [Customer] ""All smooth, no problem XX years, yeah."" [Agent] ""She is like no, I got to speak to my wife you know what I am saying My daughter, um, my daughter, she came out to me when she was XX, and I was like, ah, and then they answer I should, yeah, she knew really, really young, and I am like, All right, girl, that is fine.""

If you want to go ahead and give a cell phone to delivery, a delivery person or something along the lines, we can do one line which would be unlimited service with unlimited talk, text, and data with XX gigs of premium data for $47 because you have the gig speed of service, you get $40 off on the internet"" [Customer] ""Mm, OK. Mhm."" [Agent] ""So literally it is coming out of the same pocket $47 for the cell phone and $40 off on this, literally $7 more and you get a phone number which you can give to a delivery person or something along the line to test it out, see how it goes, and if you feel confident then at that point go ahead and switch over your other lines.""

This also comes with what is called the connection back up so for some reason your Internet ever stopped working this would turn on to automatically support your Internet. And it looks like right now we can actually offer that at just $91 additional and then there would be no installation fee to upgrade the service."" [Customer] ""OK, how much is my bill right now?""

[Customer] ""OK, so when I switch to one gig, is any of the equipment going to change or is it the same equipment?"" [Agent] ""So we do need to bring you out uh faster equipment as well as our connection back up.

The problem is that Either even if I have XGB or XGB. Maybe my location, it is in a weird spot and, or the router is set up in a weird spot that is not. Covering the whole place, and I, I even have an extender here. And it is"" [Agent] ""So you, you just said."" [Customer] ""Well, give me a good price. I will do it. Give me, what is the best you could give me, please?"" [Agent] ""I mean this, this is a good price."" [Customer] ""I."" [Agent] ""I mean $61 beforehand you were paying $377 for the services so I mean this is a good price"" [Customer] ""I know, I know. I know it is good. I know Uh, Yeah."" [Agent] ""We are upgrading your internet for you as well as getting you our connection back up. The connection back up itself runs $30 so you are actually getting the connection back up and then the X gig internet for $30. I do not know if there is much else I can do for you."" [Customer] ""I I know it is good. I know you can do a little bit better. It is, it is not even fiber, it is not even fiber optic. The, I have fiber optic with Optimum in my house I pay way less than here I have phone, TV, I."" [Agent] ""That is because you are, you are a residential customer, you are not a business customer at your home, but because those are totally two different services. But you just mentioned yourself that you have XX cell phones connected to the internet. You have got a computer. Do you have cameras within your business too to watch your all of your, uh, like your furniture and things within the business?"" [Customer] ""Yes"" [Agent] ""OK, so there is even more devices. So I mean you have a high internet need at your business, and like I said, we are giving it to you at an additional $60 where you used to pay an additional $110 and then you dropped the price down and now, so I mean we are."" [Customer] ""That is why I am not that is why I am not paying no more $110 because I could not afford it I switched for a lower payment It is not that Yeah, kind of, well, it does, I do not."" [Agent] ""But your business is suffering because of it."" [Customer] ""It is not really so, it is a matter of choice. It is Uh, we are watching TikTok videos."" [Agent] ""I mean The whole The whole thing with the internet is it is a faster upload speed."" [Customer] ""My, whatever I need this."" [Agent] ""It is the faster it is the faster time that you get to help your customers and you give them a better quality of service."" [Customer] ""I, I understand."" [Agent] ""So it is, it is not just like oh watching TikTok videos we do not care about that within a business we care about like how fast we can give the customer services."" [Customer] ""No, no, that is my point. If it, if it was really hurt, I know this is. You do not care about it, but if it is really damaging my business, I will pay XXX more. It is, if we want to, if we want it stronger and faster is because personal preferences, it is not. The business, we only use the internet to do applications, X applications a day. We do not use that much internet for customers. It is, it is a furniture store. Everything it is on display. So the internet it is for our personal preference I appreciate you giving me $60 only instead of $90 I, I appreciate. I am asking if you could help me a little bit more. I will appreciate."" [Agent] ""The only thing, the only thing I could do is remove our connection back up and I would not recommend that because uh you called in in the beginning of the conversation was your internet keeps dropping and it is not working for your business and so what I have done is I have."" [Customer] ""What does the connection back up does? Where, where does it take the. Where, where will it take the internet from the connection back then?"" [Agent] ""So if your internet drops out you have a power outage at this location, the internet turn this turns on to support your major devices, your cameras and your computers Um, it is going to make sure that your business can stay up and running no matter what kind of issues you face."" [Customer] ""OK, meaning like a little battery backup thing, that is what you mean?"" [Agent] ""It is a XG backup for your Internet."" [Customer] ""It does that, what does that do? Does that only turn on the router on if there is no electricity, the router will turn on, that is what it means?"" [Agent] ""So if your internet drops, if you have no internet, this turns on to support your internet. So no matter if there is a power outage an internet outage, you are still going to have internet within your store"" [Customer] ""Is that a hardware thing or that is uh an actual machine, an actual thing you bring?"" [Agent] ""It is an actual device."" [Customer] ""A device that I that I that the router is going to be plugged into it, correct?"" [Agent] ""Yes."" [Customer] ""So it is a battery backup, yes?"" [Agent] ""So it is not a battery backup because it is not a battery for your modem. It is a XG connection backup. So what it does is if your modem turns off,"" [Customer] ""Because I have, I have something here that I, I am sorry I, I have something here that I bought from you And I just, I am trying to figure out if it is the same thing that I that I already have or not. It is a little device where I plug I have plugged in my router"" [Agent] ""No."" [Customer] ""And when the internet goes out or the light, the electricity goes out, this is like a backup battery, which it turns on my router and it turns on my My devices."" [Agent] ""It turn that device is going to turn on your modem and keep your modem active so that you can still use hardwired internet. This is going to stay active even if you have no internet. Like even let us say for some reason all the lines around you get cut down you have no internet service through Optimum This turns on to support you with XG internet. We just started selling this product back in January. You can not buy it outright. It is something that we offer you as a product like a modem. Um, and so it is not what you currently have. This is something totally different."" [Customer] ""OK, it will support Wi Fi or only hardwire?"" [Agent] ""I believe both"" [Customer] ""OK, and if I remove it, how much will you save me?"" [Agent] ""$30.00 "" [Customer] ""So that means I will be paying XX only more?"" [Agent] ""Yes, but I do not recommend it because again the whole point when you first got on the phone with us was you wanted to upgrade your Internet because your Internet keeps dropping. This this device right here is to protect customers from their internet dropping, so I mean we can just do the connection back up and not do the upgrade and you can see if that works for you, um, but I mean I would not recommend getting rid of the connection back up we can, but in the end I feel like that is what is going to work best for your business."" [Customer] ""Give me X 2nd, hold on. I take my I No. So I am sorry to, I am sorry to keep asking. I just want to ask you something else. Let us say"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""The power, there is a power outage. The power outrage happened. The internet will, will start working. Good, perfect. But my credit card machine works. On the electricity, so my credit card machine will be off. So, will this device turn on my credit card machine as well, or will only provide me internet?"" [Agent] ""No, you would have to look into your credit card machine, uh, regarding any type of backup that is associated with them like a battery backup. This is just going to provide you internet if the power goes out you have an internet outage"" [Customer] ""Understood. I, I am really not going to need that. You could remove it. Just do the upgrade and we do not need the the backup internet. Because it is If I if if uh."" [Agent] ""I really recommend it because it is a big device that we are we are giving to all of our customers I understand where you are coming from, that your point of sale machine will not be on if and if the power is out how often do you see internet outages versus power outages"" [Customer] ""Uh, I thank God for the past year and a half I have not seen Either, you know, but it is possible that any could happen, yes, it is."" [Agent] ""OK, cause I mean when we got on the phone, you said your internet kept dropping out. And so is that not an internet outage?"" [Customer] ""No, no, I did not see my anything was dropping out. I said my internet is slow."" [Agent] ""OK, well then we can offer the X gig upgrade at an additional $31 I can have somebody come out tomorrow I have an X to XX or XX to X."" [Customer] ""Yeah, that is fine. That is perfect."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Thank you for your help."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""I really appreciate it."" [Agent] ""They will call you before they show.

[Agent] ""I just was working with someone else too, uh, so yeah, I just tried to, I just try to go around this lomo and what is going to happen is I am going to set this up as coax and then I am going to have one of my colleagues input it as fiber. So what I am going to do is I am not going to give you the soonest date that we have because that is normally what everyone wants so I just want you to just, you know, if you do not mind just being patient with me, I am going to set everything up as coax and then what I am going to do is I am going to schedule it a few days out so that we can change the code so I am going to give you the pricing."" [Customer] ""Oh yeah. Mhm."" [Agent] ""And uh and everything for coax and then I am also going to obviously let you know how much is going to be fiber wise I am going to set this thing up"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I just ask that you just be patient with me over the next XX to XX hours so I can have everything updated."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Alright, so just bear with me a few moments as I said, I am going to set everything up and review it with you and then we will be good to go."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""Alright thank you."" [Customer] ""Sure."" [Agent] ""Now so I wanted to ask you, um, we usually have a promo for like radio stations and things of that nature, um, so that is what I am going to review with you now this is going to give you, uh, it is going to give you the Internet."" [Customer] ""Uh huh. Uh Mhm."" [Agent] ""It is going to give you, um, that those X static IPs so it is going to give you around the clock protection and support and things of that nature. The only thing I wanted to ask you, which, you know, because we are a telecommunications company, I just want to make sure you did not need that. You do not need like any um like TV. You are not looking for like cable or internet or like that, anything like that."" [Customer] ""Um, well, no, I do not need cable. I mean, I just need the, um, the internet."" [Agent] ""Well, yeah, you are just going to have internet and it comes with a phone line for like emergencies if you want like a fax or an emergency line that comes bundled in. I am just making sure you do not need TV."" [Customer] ""Yeah. No, no TV. It is the radio, not TV, yeah."" [Agent] ""Exactly, I figure you do not need that."" [Customer] ""OK Yeah, sure, I appreciate that, yeah."" [Agent] ""It sounds silly, but I we are telecommunications company I have to let you know just in case. Alright, you got it. So yeah, I am almost finished setting everything up I am going to see when we can get out to you Like I said, I am not going to schedule the soonest date until I get these codes situated for fiber. Once I get situated, I could possibly bump you up from whenever we schedule it."" [Customer] ""Um Yeah."" [Agent] ""All right, be right back. OK, so it is what we are looking at, we are looking at about XXX, and that is going to be with the X gig fiber, as I said, I am setting you up with coax so we can update those fiber codes. You are going to have the fastest internet available in your region."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, well, actually go ahead."" [Customer] ""Mhm. I am listening."" [Agent] ""Well, yeah, I was going to say actually the fastest would be an X gig but that would be, you know, overkill for your set up so we are going to give you the X gig fiber. It is going to give you asymmetrical, so your upload and download's going to be the same."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""This is going to absolutely blow the speed out of the water that, um, you know, you were trying that was normally in this area because you are going to be on fiber. You are going to have those X statics as well. As I said, it comes with that rollover line and it is going to come include a failover service which is going to make sure that you maintain phone and internet services even if it gets too windy, too hot, whatever, you know, you know, people are down in your area, you are going to remain up for at least X hours."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""It is going to be that failover service is going to kick in automatically. Now keep in mind, all your optimum services and devices, slowmo are covered 100%."" [Customer] ""You Uh, go ahead."" [Agent] ""So if you need any replacement, any tech support, anything like that, we enter in XX seconds or less."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""What people are not aware of is that not just optimum devices are covered."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So some people have flat screen TVs or cameras or other computer systems that are actually. Eligible to be covered by Optimum. So if you ever need to replace anything at all, a monitor or TV screen, just make sure you check in with us first to make sure it is not covered by, you know, make sure we cover it before you run out to the store and have to buy or purchase anything new."" [Customer] ""Sure. Mhm."" [Agent] ""Alright, now, uh, as I said, you are going to be at $195 even there is a one time install of XXX bucks now we do not collect any payment from you there is no payment due to the tech"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""What I am focused on right now is just getting the install set up so I can have those codes updated. But you are not going to be providing any payment. The only thing I am going to, uh, need from you is for for you to confirm and I am still waiting on those dates, is for you to confirm who is going to be on site for the installation."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""Are you going to be there?"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""Someone else going to be there."" [Customer] ""Either be Me or the, or Neil the engineer or both."" [Agent] ""OK, I just need one. I mean, if both of you guys are good that is super too, so I just need one I have your contact information, so just give me about XX more seconds I will have those dates and times for you and I will set that up and like I said, if we need to set anything up a little sooner, I will keep in contact with you to set it up that way."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I mean, I would like to obviously the sooner the better, you know."" [Agent] ""Right, it is just that you know what it is? I want to delay it a little bit because I want those codes to be updated. I do not want them to to be gung ho and set up an install, and then they are coming to set up coax and we really need them to do, um, fiber."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""So it is it is not like, um, it is just a technical thing that I have to resolve the department I need is actually closed That is why I was not able to do it right now."" [Customer] ""Oh."" [Agent] ""So I am going to set everything up and I am going to get with them first thing in the morning."" [Customer] ""Right. Mhm. Sure."" [Agent] ""Alright, and then I can update everything sooner if needed."" [Customer] ""Right, totally."" [Agent] ""All right, OK, so I will be right back thank you sir. Hey Slowmo, uh, do you have any availability on the weekend?"" [Customer] ""On Saturday, no, but Sunday, yeah."" [Agent] ""XX, you are available on Sunday. Sunday I have X. I have Sunday the 18th. I have X to XXXX to X I have X to X."" [Customer] ""Yeah, X to X."" [Agent] ""Alright, let us get you set up for that X to X, and what is going to happen is the text they will call you XX minutes in advance so they will be able to speak with you or the engineer or whomever to let you know they are coming, um, just confirm the best contact number Slomo."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I sent this number XXX. XXXXXXX"" [Agent] ""Beautiful, so that is XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Alright beautiful so you are scheduled for Sunday you said XX to X, right?"" [Customer] ""No, no, X to X."" [Agent] ""X to X, my apologies. What am I thinking? It is Sunday. Alright, so Sunday it is going to be uh X to X as I said I am going to submit everything just to have these codes turned over and everything um, you are going to be good to go. There is now keep in mind there is no payment due today there is no payment due to the tech We just want the tech to come through, do his job. He is going to be in and out unless you guys have any questions or any kind of preferences, of course you can review that with them, but other than that the tech's not going to be looking for payment"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""They are just going to set you up with your fiber and then they are going to be out of there."" [Customer] ""Right. So they are going to run everything and install the modem, the works."" [Agent] ""The works, the gateway, the router, the modem, they are going to set you up to be good to go. As I said, this does come with a rollover line. You guys can do whatever you want with that. You are going to have your protection and support your fail over. So just keep in mind the tech is installing everything. You are not going to need to hold a hammer or a wrench you know, give him a beer or anything They are going to set everything up, minimum downtime or none, and then they are going to get out of there."" [Customer] ""Right, that is great. And what, what, what, tell me about the rollover line. How does that work?"" [Agent] ""Now the roll over, I, as I said, what people do is your line, your phone line, people use it if uh if they already have like a phone set up. So some most people use it for a fax or an alarm system, but other people say they already have like say people call in, um, however they call into the station, you now will have a roll over line so that you can plug in any phone you want and you can now receive calls on that one too."" [Customer] ""Go on. Right. I got you. OK, I got I appreciate you."" [Agent] ""So yeah that is just going to come along with your service now keep in mind though, and this is something that you may be interested in, you guys are eligible and I see you guys have not taken advantage of it. You guys are eligible for Optimum Business mobile so at any time you guys can get a new iPhone or a new Android in the business name.

Alright, and your name?"" [Customer] ""Evil and Martin."" [Agent] ""How are you doing, Miss Martin? For security purposes, would you also be able to verify for me your X digit access code?"" [Customer] ""And XXXX."" [Agent] ""Thank you. I see you also have a pending trouble call for today between X and X."" [Customer] ""Yes, yes, we have had drops yesterday and today and so I was, I have been trying to upgrade for quite a while but we have had another software that was had conflicts that we had to deal with first, um."" [Agent] ""OK. Mhm. Mm."" [Customer] ""So I thought, well, we are going to have to get a new modem and I asked if what about upgrading and of course they they told me that um. X gig right now is like XXX and XXX is like. Uh, $30 more than what we are paying or something like that, um. And back in January and and even last year I kept getting these ads for um. Um, XGB for $200 per month for the X year contract."" [Agent] ""Yeah, those are like acquisition offers yeah."" [Customer] ""And I do not expect I do not know if that is uh anything I can get close to I would settle for paying just a little bit more um is there any way to get X gig at the XXX $500 price"" [Agent] ""Let me take a look to see if there is a better rate."" [Customer] ""To the OK, that'd be great."" [Agent] ""What is the best rate I can get you one gig at, OK? Hold on one moment, I am going to place you on a brief hold. Should this call drop for any reason, can I reach you back at the XXX-XXX-XXXX?"" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""Alright, hold on one second, Ms. Martin."" [Customer] ""OK"" [Agent] ""Thank you so much for your patience. So you actually do have a couple of options if you want to upgrade to a gig, we do have a promotional offer where it would only be a difference of $65 from what you are currently paying."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So if you want to upgrade to the X gig, it would be $285 will be your new monthly rate. Again, that is $65 more than what you are currently paying. It is free for the tech to come out and swap out your modem, get the new modem for X gig, and if you want to do even more savings than that, I do not know, um, who do you guys use for a mobile phone? Who is your mobile provider?"" [Customer] ""AT&T, I mean, but it."" [Agent] ""Are you, are you on the contract of financing your device with AT&T?"" [Customer] ""No, and I do not want to be either. It is mainly a family family thing with the company, um, I do not think we will be changing because he just, he just got a new phone and he ordered it yesterday, so."" [Agent] ""OK. Well, hear me out. You hear me out on the offer that way before you just shut it down, just know what is available to you, right? If you decided to bring over a mobile line, right, our mobile plan is an unlimited text and talk plan."" [Customer] ""OK. Mhm."" [Agent] ""You can keep your existing device as well as your number. No contracts are required, right? The mobile plan itself is $45 you would get an additional $40 off of that price So instead of your rate going up $65 XXGB, it would only be a difference of $25 your mobile plan would only be $45"" [Customer] ""OK, I do not, I do not think I would even talk him into that."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Um, XXX for X gig though, and that is."" [Agent] ""Mhm. So XX month offer, no contract free for the tech to come out. Services include protection and support through Asurion. It includes, um, like I said, it includes a new modem for X gig, and there is no charge for the tech to come out to swap out your modem because it would have to be swapped out."" [Customer] ""OK. OK, they are coming out today to do that because we are having these problems the technical"" [Agent] ""today they are coming up for trouble call. This would actually be um an upgrade order I have availability as early as Thursday, which is tomorrow"" [Customer] ""No She, she said they would replace she said that they would replace my modem because it is old and that is probably the problem."" [Agent] ""Right. What I mean is a replacement modem is only going to sustain the modem that you currently have."" [Customer] ""That is not what she said."" [Agent] ""Like for XXX megabytes."" [Customer] ""She said we call back in , OK, well, she said I could call back in This modem would cover XXX or XX gig. I will have to just call back in and tell them what we want to upgrade. So can we get that fixed before they come out here?"" [Agent] ""Unfortunately, yeah. No, you would not be able to do that before, like, because your modem is not compatible for it. It is going to make me schedule order either way. There is no charge for the tech to come out I would have to schedule the appointment"" [Customer] ""OK Uh, I am totally confused, but that is OK, um."" [Agent] ""I am not sure why anybody would tell you, you know that the modem because the tech, like most of the times when you are not upgrading your services, the techs are only going to bring you out equipment to sustain what you currently have"" [Customer] ""OK, so the Mhm."" [Agent] ""That is, that is protocol. We are not, they are not going to give you a gig modem for XXX megabytes speed because it again what is the purpose of it? They are not, you know, the modems typically match what the customer has as far as the service is rendered so I do not know why young lady will even give you that information"" [Customer] ""OK. OK. But she, she might Yeah, they probably just did not know for something she is very sweet, um."" [Agent] ""Right."" [Customer] ""Anyhow, that'd be fine."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""We let the X, let us do the XXX."" [Agent] ""Alright, knock out somebody out there tomorrow."" [Customer] ""XXXX months XX months, right?"" [Agent] ""XX months, no contract, no contract."" [Customer] ""No contract, is that what you said? OK."" [Agent] ""XX months, no charge for the tech to come out. We have between XX and X tomorrow."" [Customer] ""And that'll work."" [Agent] ""What is the best number they can call when they are on their way?"" [Customer] ""And, uh, XXX, you want something to text you or you want something to call?"" [Agent] ""for the tech, you know, when the tech is en route, you know."" [Customer] ""OK, but would he rather text would he rather call"" [Agent] ""I will reach out to? It is up to you."" [Customer] ""OK, um, Hold just give him this number XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Agent] ""That is XXX-XXX-XXXX correct?"" [Customer] ""Yes, and there is not a way to catch this tech today and tell him to bring the other modem?"" [Agent] ""No, again, because the, the way they have your order in right now is for trouble call. Trouble call and sales upgrades to two different teams."" [Customer] ""OK OK, I got you."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""OK"" [Agent] ""Alright, I will send you an email to confirm this before I complete this. Do you have any other questions or concerns?"" [Customer] ""No, I keep thinking, where's the catch, because there is always a catch with these things you are saying there is no con no contract and XX months, X gig"" [Agent] ""Yeah, just to give you a quick recap, just to give you a quick recap, there are no contractual obligations."" [Customer] ""Mhm OK."" [Agent] ""You can upgrade, downgrade, cancel, or indifferent. There are no penalties to do so. There is no charge for the technician to come out and set services up. It is a difference of $65. Your new monthly rate will be $285. Your tax will be $1.50. So the total price, including tax, is $286.50. This will include a new modem. The rate will be good for XX months. On the 23rd month we do send notification by way of your statement to let you know that the promotional discount is coming to an end. If we have a renewal option or different promotions available for you at that time, we will be more than happy to assist you with that at that point."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""You are not obligated if you do not like the rates, what have you you want to cancel, change, or indifferent There are no penalties. Services include protection and support through Asurion for additional technical support should you need it. And that is everything all of our calls are recorded for quality assurance as well Once again, my name is Rashaw, so I do not want you to think there are any catches with the offer. I want to be as transparent as possible with you."" [Customer] ""OK, I got it thank you very much."" [Agent] ""Alright, you are welcome."" [Customer] ""Alright."" [Agent] ""Is there anything else that I can assist you with today?"" [Customer] ""No, and you have got my email address right?"" [Agent] ""Yes, the email we have is E Martin at XStar.com is that the one?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah Yes, yes, that is correct, uh-huh."" [Agent] ""OK, alright, you are all set.""

[Customer] ""No, trust me, my boss is uh. Mm I say no more."" [Agent] ""Got you. Right, right, um, so it seems like it is very, very minimal there, um."" [Customer] ""Mhm.""

[Agent] ""Right, right, right, OK, uh, understood."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, And do you guys use your mobile phones for the business at all?"" [Customer] ""Um, he uses phone like if he is going to be at the office, he transferred the phone line to his phone."" [Agent] ""Does it to his cell phone? OK, cool, good to, good to know, um."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""Because you do qualify for additional discounts when you bundle in mobile, so if he wanted to bundle in, uh, bring his mobile phone over from Verizon to Optim or if he has Verizon, um, whoever he has."" [Customer] ""No. Oh, I do not know what phone he has we do want to transfer our office number"" [Agent] ""Right."" [Customer] ""Well that office number, uh, to."" [Agent] ""Right, so we could definitely get you, we could definitely get your office number from Verizon to Optimum for the office there."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Uh, what I am referring to is if you wanted to bring his mobile number over from his current company over to Optimum Mobile we connected to the account for Hamiltonian Garden since he does use his cell phone for business purposes, this could be a good opportunity for him to save some money not only on his internet account for"" [Customer] ""My boss is not going to do that and I do understand but he just also renewed his contract so he will not be out of his contract and I do not think he wants to do that mhm."" [Agent] ""Really? Right. Understood, understood. So what I would just ask of you, uh, Carlene is just to kind of pass over that info because you never know, he may, he may be like, oh, I can save this amount of money if I just do this, and you know it could be a win-win for him, um."" [Customer] ""I will. Mhm. OK, I will."" [Agent] ""He sounds like the type of guy who would love to save money anywhere he can."" [Customer] ""OK, he, he does, he does."" [Agent] ""Cool, um, so you know, with all that being said, you being in the basement, uh, even though you are a minimal operation down there, you said that he would like to have a high speed internet for those purposes."" [Customer] ""Mm."" [Agent] ""So this is what I recommend, um."" [Customer] ""Yeah Mhm."" [Agent] ""So where's my sheet here? It just automatically pops up and then like it kind of disappears on me. Um, so, um, I recommend going with X gig. So that is going to be the, the top tier internet here. X gigabit internet that is XXXX megabits on the download speed, um, with that phone line that you are going to bring over from Verizon, um, you are only looking at uh."" [Customer] ""Uh huh"" [Agent] ""Hold on one second. Where did that go? You are only looking at XXX monthly, which is fairly inexpensive for X gig and a phone line. It is pretty much on par with you know, everybody else in the industry right now giving a gig away for XXX bucks, um, and then you are getting the phone line uh at a discount there So it would be $110 monthly, um, well that is when you, that is when you sign up for auto pay paperless billing."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, otherwise it is $115 so you do get a $5 discount for signing up for auto pay and saving some trees at the same time, um then if you wanted to go with the XXX speed tier which is our middle tier, and this is, this is the lowest I would recommend you going because we do offer XXX megabits, but"" [Customer] ""OK. Uh Mhm."" [Agent] ""Since you are in the basement, it is not going to, it is not going to go well for you. I can tell you that right now. Uh, and we do not want your, um you know, your boss getting all upset with the internet connection"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So if you were to do the XXX speed, if you want to save a couple bucks, it is not that big of a difference, um, so that is. Uh, $100.02 year price guarantee, no contract. So honestly for the extra $10 you get twice the internet speed."" [Customer] ""OK, uh, question two, what if we do not do the phone line and just, uh, do the Internet?"" [Agent] ""Mhm. Um, it is so the, so all of our, uh, packages are set up in a double player or a triple play configuration, yeah, so the phone line is included, so you might as well just go with it, uh, yeah."" [Customer] ""How much would that cost? XX, OK, OK. You will go ahead and use it. OK, do me a favor can you send me that package, uh, information in my email so I can let her know?"" [Agent] ""So I can send you an email. What I would like to do, Carlene, um, it is because there is no contract with Optimum, obviously you can always make changes at any time."" [Customer] ""Mhm Mhm. OK."" [Agent] ""What I would recommend is we because our calendar does fill up quite quickly, especially since we are in the middle of May already, if you want to do this sooner than later."" [Customer] ""Uh huh"" [Agent] ""Let us get you on the schedule and make an appointment. You do not have to stick to stick to it."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""If your, if your boss does not like the, the deal, obviously just get in touch with me directly we cancel the appointment"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""It is just as easy as that, but if everything is cool and he is like, yeah, let us go with it, the appointment's already set up, um, and then you have to worry about it."" [Customer] ""Oh. OK, uh, one second, let me do this real quick."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Or if you want to just send them a message like, hey."" [Customer] ""And that is what I am doing now, um I know she is not going to answer me right away but um let us see"" [Agent] ""XXX. Right, well, at least, at least you know if she does say yeah cool let us go, you do not have to worry about calling me back or or you know missing out on a certain day because the calendar is full, you know what I mean?"" [Customer] ""Uh huh. OK"" [Agent] ""So you do that I will set this up quick"" [Customer] ""Uh, See Um Let us see um. So if we set up auto pay it would be XXX right?"" [Agent] ""XXX XXX without the auto pay."" [Customer] ""OK, one second, I am sorry, hold on a second please."" [Agent] ""Go for it, take your time."" [Customer] ""Mhm. I am sorry."" [Agent] ""It is OK, Carlene. Thank thanks for coming back."" [Customer] ""I wish people would read their contract."" [Agent] ""Uh."" [Customer] ""Oh my God, they drive me nuts. Uh"" [Agent] ""You know it is one of those things where it is just like yeah let me just check and agree to the terms and conditions and then it is just like hey wait a second."" [Customer] ""Uh Now when it comes to lease and stuff like that you got, you, you have to read it you you know you can not rely on people, um."" [Agent] ""Oh, of course. My, uh, my apartment lease, um, I live in Brook I live in Brooklyn, and the lease that they give us is like, it is like XX pages long."" [Customer] ""Uh huh Oh Ours is only X, but it is on legal paper."" [Agent] ""It is, it is like it is, it is no, it seems, I mean it seems like it is XX pages, but like, but like it might even be just XX pages, but it is front and back and there is like, you know, rules for, for, you know, gates on the windows or lead paint."" [Customer] ""It is basic, yeah. Right. Oh, I am, I am sorry, honey, can you hold on a second again for me please?"" [Agent] ""Of course Carline, no, no, go ahead, go ahead."" [Customer] ""I am sorry, hold on. OK, I am sorry."" [Agent] ""It is OK, do not apologize, you are fine, um."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, so you were saying they give you XX pages, but you know what, even with my apartment complex, they highlight the most important things, you know, that, that is very important and one of them is the noise."" [Agent] ""I Right, right, right, right. Mhm."" [Customer] ""Uh, another is to clean your area, you know, uh, uh, because I am like it is, it is almost like a garden apartment, so you can clean the front and the back, you know, they tell you what your, uh, late fees are, you know, stuff like that."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Right, right, right, right, right. Mhm. Right."" [Customer] ""They, they highlight it as well as."" [Agent] ""I grew up in um, I grew up in Garden Apartments when I was um in Queens so I am definitely familiar with that sort of situation"" [Customer] ""Yeah, right, right, so you know, uh, uh, a lot of them do not do that, and it is funny because I tell you the situation. I live on the first floor."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""My mom lives with me because she is, you know, at that age I help take care of her"" [Agent] ""Sure."" [Customer] ""And you know we have the people upstairs and I swear it is like a lot of people do not have common sense."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Now, this woman is a teacher. She does, she teaches high school kids, OK?"" [Agent] ""Right."" [Customer] ""I might not be the smartest cookie, OK I do have common sense, right"" [Agent] ""Right."" [Customer] ""So. You know, I was nice. She moved in a month, uh, so, you know, I spoke to the, uh, um, the management property there, so I tell her, you know, they are making too much. She is like, oh, they, they, they are really nice, you know, they are just we give them some time. I said, OK, so like after two months now I am thinking you are in and you know everything is fine, but she has a daughter and they walk like a cow, both of them."" [Agent] ""Right.""

[Customer] ""Mhm. Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, normally that happens when like say like the, the, how do we call it we call it a um. Uh, what is the term? Sometimes when you have a phone number at a different location and you want to port it over to a new location, sometimes the oh the rate center is different when it comes to dialing up to XXX."" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""Um, so you sometimes you can not bring over numbers anywhere. It has to be a certain area code in the first three digits that actually actually means something."" [Customer] ""Right Right."" [Agent] ""I never knew that."" [Customer] ""Uh yeah, I mean we do have other numbers for that location, but that is like the fire and alarm, you know, uh, right."" [Agent] ""Cool. Right, right, I I understand that. um, so as long as that number is already there at one Warrenville Road, it should not be an issue."" [Customer] ""Yes Yes.""

[Agent] ""With the with the ported phone, um, that is XXX-XXX-XXXX, your monthly recurring uh at the moment is $115 obviously when you sign up for the auto pay $110 you will see a as long as you keep everything the way it is, you will see a one time installation fee of $100 on your very first bill that is for the technician to come out there and set everything up."" [Customer] ""Right. Mhm. OK."" [Agent] ""Uh, so your first bill obviously will be a little bit more than XXX, uh, because it is going to have the installation fee on there."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Uh, what I like to tell my what I like to tell my clients though is, you know once you get that first bill, you know, reach out to me"" [Customer] ""OK Mhm."" [Agent] ""I will put you in touch with billing and see if they can get you like a bill credit for the, uh, installation or something like that, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK, sounds good."" [Agent] ""Um, so, um, I can not, I can not always guarantee that, but at least we could do is ask, you know what I mean?"" [Customer] ""Right, yeah, it does not hurt."" [Agent] ""Um, and then, and then lastly. Um, this is going to be, this is very, very important, Carly, and this is for the porting of the number you are going to get another email so you should be expecting, you should be expecting two emails."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK."" [Agent] ""You should be expecting the confirmation email then you should be expecting the um authorization email so this is going to be an email where you are going to authorize the phone number to come over from Verizon to Optimum Business so um there is going to be a link in that email"" [Customer] ""Uh huh OK. OK Mhm."" [Agent] ""Open it up, click on the link."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, fill out the corresponding info which is going to be the phone number you are bringing over, the, the provider which is Verizon, they are going to ask for the Verizon account number and I, I believe Verizon also has uh a PIN number involved."" [Customer] ""Right. OK."" [Agent] ""So if you have the Verizon Pin, make sure to include that as well."" [Customer] ""I do not have a pin date. I, I always bypass it. I never had a pin and there is like I send you a one time pin, so I do not have a pen."" [Agent] ""OK, so Right, right, right, so do not worry about that."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So so include the phone number, include the provider which is Verizon, um, and then you are going to accept terms and conditions and then you are going to press submit it it is done all through that link and then as soon as you hit that submit button, that is when the X to X business days starts so make sure you do that right away so that way there is no delays."" [Customer] ""Right OK OK OK OK Yes."" [Agent] ""You can even do that um if you want to wait for the um the approval from your boss, that is totally cool, uh, if you, if you just wanted to to take care of that. Um, not obviously nothing's going to happen if you do not install so you can you can, you can take care of that authorization email"" [Customer] ""Right. And reschedule it."" [Agent] ""You can get, you can take care of the authorization email, but say your boss comes back and says, hey, you know, we are not going to go with Optimum obviously if you do end up canceling the appointment."" [Customer] ""Uh huh"" [Agent] ""All that porting stuff that you did is just going to cancel itself out too so you can kind of get that authorization out of the way, uh, because it is very, very easy, but obviously if you want to wait until you get the OK from your boss to do that, you could do that just do that as soon as possible once you get the OK, alright, so there is no delays in the installation, right?"" [Customer] ""OK OK OK OK, sounds good and thank you so much for your help, Danielle."" [Agent] ""Alright Carlene, yeah, of course, it was pleasure, pleasure speaking with you.""

[Agent] ""And that is including let us say maybe security cameras or anything?"" [Customer] ""We have X, well, that, that is, I was going to say that is now, it is actually probably more than that then because we have X PCs, um, we do have an iPad that we run our POS system off of, and then, uh, cell phones for our employees, you know, that when they are connected to Wi Fi. But the main, the main thing is the X PCs, X printers, um a tablet"" [Agent] ""OK. I will see if we have any upgrade options for you with speed as well because once again you have the XXX we do have XXX and X gig. So I am just going to place you on a brief hold, give me one minute."" [Customer] ""Uh, well, the only thing about that is that um we are not getting anywhere near the speed of the XXX gigabytes that we are supposed to anyway."" [Agent] ""Yeah Right over the."" [Customer] ""Like we are just not getting the speed. Like when I, when I Yeah, with the, with the, with the service that we have right, yeah, we, we, they did a test for us and when I first called and when we were having issues it was like up upload speeds of like 3.5 and then the technician came and he was able to get it to like XX."" [Agent] ""With the coop."" [Customer] ""So I do not know that upgrading is to like. The XXX is helpful. I am I am, I am not sure though, so."" [Agent] ""Well, over fiber, it will be a consistent speed, unlike the coax connection."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So it is a newer network that we do have so it will be either XXX or somewhere let us say like XXXXXX it is going to be in that range it is not going to be so off to where."" [Customer] ""But it would be on the fiber optic."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""OK, I am sorry I misunderstood what you are saying"" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""I thought you were sort of trying to look us to get to better speed on the same the network we have, but you are, you are actually saying it is XXX with fiber optic.""

It would be a free install, of course we will come out swap out the modem equipment, put the new fiber line in, and get everything set up for you."" [Customer] ""OK, uh, and then when I am ready to move forward with, with that, do I just call again call sales again to get that set up, or how do I, I am not ready to move forward with it now when I want to, when do I, how do I move forward"" [Agent] ""Yes, same thing you would give us a call. Any concerns that you have right now?"" [Customer] ""Um, I am just like budget wise I just need to make sure that it makes sense for us."" [Agent] ""Got you. So more of the budget than anything. Let me see what the $300 fee would be for you if you stick with the XXX. It might be more of the ballpark that you are looking for, and you can always upgrade to the XXX or X gig if you need it like in the future you needed something faster than the XXX."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So let us see what that would be. So the XXX speed would be $55 making the total monthly bill XXXXX."" [Customer] ""OK. Um, Yeah, I think then And then what in terms of like my billing and all that sort of stuff is just how."" [Agent] ""Everything will remain the same."" [Customer] ""Is it going to be prorated?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, like your billing cycle is going to remain the same."" [Customer] ""OK, so it is just going to, they are just going to."" [Agent] ""Let me see, it is based off of when it is set up is when the prorated charge would kick in. So let us see, for example, if we pick. Waiting for the days to pop up, give me one second. OK, here we go so next available date in this area is Thursday the 22nd, so let us say if we go with next Thursday. Waiting for the prorated now. The prorated would be $28.41 for that billing cycle, but it would be on the next billing cycle. So for example, nothing would be paid today over the phone, nothing is given to the technician everything would be on the first bill after the upgrade"" [Customer] ""OK, um, and you said the XX. I is the day the technician would be in the area, uh, yeah, OK, yeah, I, I would like to go ahead and set that up, yeah, yeah."" [Agent] ""That'll work?

[Customer] ""As long as they can call me in advance I can be here at X a.m. We do not open here until uh XX, um, but if I need to be here at X a.m. then then yes, and I would prefer to have it be earlier so.""

No, that that time frame on the 22nd is is better because I would rather have less service disruption when they are trying to switch everything over so."" [Agent] ""Yeah. OK perfect so let us see what would be a good number for the technician to call that day?"" [Customer] ""Um, XXX. XXX. XXXX."" [Agent] ""XX Perfect, so they will give you a call about XXXX minutes out."" [Customer] ""Great."" [Agent] ""And just to give you a quick recap, monthly rate would be the XXX. And XX cents a difference of $55 for install for the technician to come out to the location and just to let you know as well, we recently came with came out with our uh backup Internet server also here at Optimum is through the cellular network. So if you do have any allergies in the area due to inclement weather, a line is damaged, no matter what the scenario is, it will automatically kick in and roll over to the cellular backup until the line is up and running. So we do have that as other options now. I believe that is starting at about $30 a month.""
