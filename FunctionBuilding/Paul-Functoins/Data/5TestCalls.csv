[Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Requesting and um representatives come out to talk to us about um possible upgrades to our system. Um, our system came over on the dinosaurs, so therefore our phone systems. Um Will not work with none of the new phones where our phone services are going in and out Our internet is slow as myuzo, um. Even though we have XXX megabytes per second, we are still dropping out with Internet daily, um, and somebody came out and said oh it is not the modem, but the modem is like a XXXX modem."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""Our system is older than that. Our phone system is older than that, so we will we would like a representative to come out to see what could be possibly done to get our systems up to date"" [Agent] ""OK. OK, and what is the address that you are speaking of?"" [Customer] ""Um, XXX South Heritage Street."" [Agent] ""And the zip code for that?"" [Customer] ""XXX-XX our phone systems are so old we can not even get phones. That can run caller ID."" [Agent] ""Now do you have phones through us do you have a separate phone system like, like do we provide the phone like the physical phones to you do y'all just purchase your own physical phone"" [Customer] ""Um No, our phones, no, I mean we have had these spring up."" [Agent] ""OK, so let me see, so you only."" [Customer] ""That is how old our system is. I mean we are using phones that work with the system that we have upstairs that is through the phone company. Our boxes and stuff and they are so oh we can not get new phones. Because they will not work with Trot. I mean we can not even get a business phone in here with caller ID because it will caller ID it these phones will not work with our system because they are so old."" [Agent] ""OK, we do have the ability to provide you with a phone system, but also looking at your account here, you do also have some older codes on the account because caller ID is a feature that everyone should have that it should easily go with it, um, now with."" [Customer] ""But that is what I am saying the system upstairs is so old. It will not allow it. The new phones to work with because the phones that we have do not have caller ID."" [Agent] ""OK, so now you are."" [Customer] ""But when we try to put a phone that like what we have got a newer phone. It will not work because our system is not compatible with the system."" [Agent] ""And who is your who is your system upstairs to?"" [Customer] ""Upstairs. Yeah But it is been here so long Optimum did not install it."" [Agent] ""Yeah, because I do not think you have any type of phone system through us. All you are going to have through us is you are going to have a modem. The modem then connects analog phones. It is not a phone system, it is just basic analog phones, um."" [Customer] ""No, I am saying is all wiring and stuff for our business lines. Which I mean we have phones for y'all like you know we get our phone. With y'all. I mean we got our phone in long distance with business features, features that we are not able to."" [Agent] ""So I mean, so we supply you because I think that might be where the confusion is we do not supply the phone system."" [Customer] ""Yeah No."" [Agent] ""Your phone system is probably just needing to be upgraded however you need to upgrade it."" [Customer] ""This stuff upstairs, that is the phone wires. All that upstairs is what is preventing us from updating our phones. And that is through the phone company. The phone company installed that."" [Agent] ""What phone company?"" [Customer] ""The one that was"" [Agent] ""Like I"" [Customer] ""Well y'all bought them out so technically yes y'all."" [Agent] ""OK. Let us see, and"" [Customer] ""I mean y'all just kind of inherited this account."" [Agent] ""So you also, you also mentioned the internet as well, the XXX meg internet."" [Customer] ""When y'all bought it."" [Agent] ""How many devices would you say you have connected to the internet?"" [Customer] ""Maybe X."" [Agent] ""Just like X computers, no personal devices, no tablets, no TVs."" [Customer] ""Um, we have. X computers. We have one camera system. And X printers that run Wi Fi and that is it."" [Agent] ""How many cameras are on the camera system?"" [Customer] ""Not that many."" [Agent] ""OK, because those count as devices too, because most businesses I do not normally recommend the XXXX. If a business comes into me, especially in automotive business that is needing to pull out quotes and loans and stuff along those lines, we normally are going to recommend a faster speed like our X gig for that."" [Customer] ""Well, like I said, our modem. It is from XXXX, but they said there is nothing wrong with it I know there is"" [Agent] ""So I mean we can offer to get you an upgrade on the account which would bring in new, a new modem, new equipment, and it would upgrade all the codes on your account."" [Customer] ""Well that is what we would like we, we really want a representative to come out so they can see what we are dealing with because we tried to beforehand and they are like oh there is not a problem, but they need to somebody needs to physically come out here that is a representative to see what we are dealing with. Because I mean technicians just look at it and say oh no there is not a problem there is a problem because we can say oh we are getting upgrades all we want like you said we are supposed to we are paying for caller ID"" [Agent] ""So I do not have"" [Customer] ""We do not have car."" [Agent] ""Well, you also have very old codes on the account. Your codes are very old because it does not look like you have ever gotten a new promotion on the account. It does not look like we have ever really upgraded the account um, so your phone codes are very old now we can offer I was looking here because I do not have the ability to send out a technician. Uh, we, I just do not, are not a technician, a representative. I do not have the ability to just send somebody out, um, but what I can do is I can offer you to upgrade the codes on your account get you into a faster speed, so you would get a brand new modem, um, let us see"" [Customer] ""What I mean why do we want to put more money in here when we can not when we are dropping completely out daily."" [Agent] ""I mean it might be that the one the the XXX does not work for you to have something lop out daily."" [Customer] ""It do not matter if I can No I mean we have had issues we have had issues for years This has nothing to do with this has to do with our equipment. And our wiring. That is what I am trying to say we do not want to put more money into something that we are still having issues with."" [Agent] ""So I mean, the only OK then all I can really offer you is to get you over to tech support."" [Customer] ""That is why we really need somebody to come out. OK, maybe somebody. OK, let us do that."" [Agent] ""Because I mean because you are in so now I can offer you Intels to get you a faster speed which is going to get you brand new equipment as well as all of our brand new equipment comes with what is called the connection backup so anytime your system does fail like you are stating it automatically turns on to keep supporting your devices. This would also update your phone codes on the account and so I mean just just looking here at what we can offer right off the bat."" [Customer] ""Because I mean we are paying $15 a month for Internet equipment. I do not even know what that is."" [Agent] ""It is your modem, your modem upstairs that supports the services."" [Customer] ""The one that we have had since XXXX."" [Agent] ""So yeah, so we can get you in a faster speed of equipment, a faster modem we can get you in that connection back up and get all of your codes updated as well as put you into a new promotion because right now you are not in any type of promotion so the the rate just is going to keep increasing because of that I mean I can offer you all of this at just an additional XXXX and then no installation charge to send out the technician to upgrade the equipment"" [Customer] ""So I mean it is like we would have all new wiring put in."" [Agent] ""So the technician comes out he is going to check your modem and change out your modem and the wiring to your modem When you say wiring, are we talking about the Ethernet cables from the modem to the phones?"" [Customer] ""No, we do not have Ethernet cables to the phones."" [Agent] ""How do you connect your phones to the equipment?"" [Customer] ""We have regular phone lines. That is how old our phones is."" [Agent] ""When you say regular. So then yeah he would update the lines as well he would update whatever needs to be updated because you are getting an upgrade."" [Customer] ""So what would that be look like a month?"" [Agent] ""Um, it looks like it would bring it up to 2:30."" [Customer] ""OK, that is something I would have to discuss with the. Owner before I can authorize that."" [Agent] ""Do you want to put me on hold and reach out to him since I mean you have got someone who is trying to help you?"" [Customer] ""Um. So what all will that entail with that extra charge?"" [Agent] ""What do you mean by that? Like what"" [Customer] ""OK, so right now we are paying about $170."" [Agent] ""Upgrades are you getting? OK. And so this would bring it up to 229.50."" [Customer] ""Yeah I am So how much is that speed?"" [Agent] ""So beforehand your XXX meg internet you are paying about XXXX. This brings it up to XXX plus we are putting additional discounts of $120 on there to cover the connection back up as well as your phone lines. So you are really, you are just seeing the additional $49.50 dollars monthly you are getting almost double the speed, the connection back up you are getting a new promotion on your account XXX megabytes per second."" [Customer] ""And so that is connection back up XXX megabytes this will completely upgrade our phone systems"" [Agent] ""Yes, he is going to come out there, he is going to upgrade the modem if the lines need to be changed as well, he will change those as well."" [Customer] ""And it is a $120. Savings."" [Agent] ""So you get a promotional discount of $120. So when he sees his bill every month, or she, whoever the owner is, and they see their bill every month, but how we price it out is you are going to see the full rates for everything, so you are going to see that $245 for the internet, you are going to see $20 for the phone, the $30 for the connection back up, and then in the end we put $120 in discounts on there to bring it down to the $229."" [Customer] ""OK, and how long is this promotion good for?"" [Agent] ""This is a X year price guarantee. It is not a contract. It is just a price guarantee for the next X years."" [Customer] ""OK, let me put you on hold."" [Agent] ""OK, thank you."" [Customer] ""XX WN Ma'am?"" [Agent] ""Yes ma'am."" [Customer] ""OK, so he said I just got off the phone with him. He said, um, what would be if we added like Internet phones? Or virtual assistants or whatever, how would that work?"" [Agent] ""So our voice over IP services is that what you are talking about?"" [Customer] ""Uh yes."" [Agent] ""OK, how many phone lines do you have? Because I am seeing that you actually only have one with us."" [Customer] ""We have X lines."" [Agent] ""What are those phone numbers?"" [Customer] ""Uh da da da da. I want to think it is XXXX and then maybe XXXX maybe."" [Agent] ""OK, let me see in the XXXX let us see. Mm mm. Now why I ask how many lines you have with us is because our voice over IP phone system requires us to have a minimum of X lines."" [Customer] ""OK, we do not have, we have, we have X phones but only X lines."" [Agent] ""Yeah same. OK, both of those numbers are on here, so you do have two phone lines with us that is correct. OK. And then what does he think about doing the upgrade with the connection back up and the new promotion?"" [Customer] ""Um, he was, you know, like I said, was wanting to know about the internet thing, but it requires X lines."" [Agent] ""Mhm. It does require X lines, yes ma'am."" [Customer] ""So for actual phone numbers."" [Agent] ""Yes, so it would be X actual phone numbers as well as with um our VoIP services. Every phone would have to have a phone number, so you mentioned you have X phones, so then it would have to have a number pointed to that phone, um, so I believe that normally, uh, so X phones and the phones run $40.80 or XX $40.95 a piece, and so if we were to do X of those."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""It would be about XXX XX."" [Customer] ""Hold on X 2nd."" [Agent] ""Yeah, take your time. And then I did want to let you know that we could do this upgrade as soon as tomorrow morning. I have an X to XX or an XX to X."" [Customer] ""So he wants to know is the 2:30 the total bill if we do not go with the Internet phones."" [Agent] ""Yes ma'am, the 2:30 would be the total bill if you do not go with the Internet phones."" [Customer] ""And what is your name? I forgot to get that."" [Agent] ""Oh Lizzie."" [Customer] ""Is it um I or Y?"" [Agent] ""Oh, you can do I."" [Customer] ""OK, so Um, you said what are the times tomorrow?"" [Agent] ""X to XX or XX to X."" [Customer] ""Let us say XX to X.""

Did you want to possibly upgrade the speed here because this address is fiber capable? We can actually upgrade you to fiber. And with the fiber you would be getting uh dedicated speeds here."" [Customer] ""So So what plan do I have right now?"" [Agent] ""You have a XXX megabits download coax connection um and about maybe XX megabits upload."" [Customer] ""Really?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, so you are at the lowest, uh, bandwidth for the coax."" [Customer] ""And how much is the uh fiber? Uh, OK, how much is the"" [Agent] ""Um, let me take a look and see what we could do here. I am just going to look at some upgrade offers. Sorry for the delay. I am just waiting for those offers to open up here. Sorry if I got quiet. I am just actually looking here for you. And then the modem rental would go away as well, bear with me. So if you were to add the phone line, sir, and upgrade to a fiber connection, the change in your monthly rate would be $80.05. So instead of $40 for the line it would be $80 you would also have the upgraded speed sir You would have a X gigabyte connection, uh, fiber, so that is X gig up, X gig down. You would be getting symmetrical speeds with the internet."" [Customer] ""Mm."" [Agent] ""And then with the fiber upgrade, you would actually save the phone the fee for the phone for the technician"" [Customer] ""Right. And What"" [Agent] ""So you would be getting uh, you know Greater speeds here, more productivity in your business."" [Customer] ""Right, uh, can we just do the, uh, uh, porting for now? I, uh, I have to leave for my other office and, uh. I will consider that in the, you know, uh, X or X days."" [Agent] ""Sure, well, the only thing is that with the porting it would be the same appointment time frame."" [Customer] ""Right now I am"" [Agent] ""If that makes sense so they could do both at the same time. And then with the upgrade you would also get a $50 gift card."" [Customer] ""Uh, Uh, no, not right now, just the, the X thing for now."" [Agent] ""OK, so the porting is the primary no worries, allow me a moment here and I am working on the date of when we can get that number for you, OK"" [Customer] ""I guess I got to go. OK."" [Agent] ""Bear with me one second."" [Customer] ""So that"" [Agent] ""Where is its own billing telephone number sir? With this current uh provider. So when you get a bill right now from your current provider, that number is the number that is associated with the bill the XXX-XXX"" [Customer] ""Yes XXX X."" [Agent] ""OK, I just want to make sure. XXX-XXXX, that is the number?"" [Customer] ""Well that is the one that we are reporting, right?"" [Agent] ""Yes, I am that is what I am confirming like when you get a bill from your other provider that is the number that is associated with the bill."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""OK. I am just running the number now through the system the system will indicate to me the first available port date, OK"" [Customer] ""XX The"" [Agent] ""We are almost set here sir sorry uh for the delay."" [Customer] ""We are all set."" [Agent] ""Uh, almost, um, the system is about to generate the first available date that that number would be available to be reported. I know you have to go, um. I am moving as quickly as possible here bear with me. So, let us see. The first available date that your provider would release that online to Optimum would be Monday the 5th of May. I could do X to XXXX to X, or X to X."" [Customer] ""Oh, is there any physical thing to do?"" [Agent] ""Yes, we actually send a technician out to provision the modem so the modem would be provisioned on site, sir"" [Customer] ""OK. Uh,"" [Agent] ""If that date does not work for you we could do Tuesday, Wednesday yeah, there is no lapse in service your number will continue to work with your current provider until then"" [Customer] ""Add the number. Oh, can we do, uh, Tuesday then?"" [Agent] ""Sure, and then what time frame did you want? X to XXXX to X, or X to X?"" [Customer] ""X to XX."" [Agent] ""And then the best contact number for the technicians to phone you, is that the number you are calling from XXXXXXX-XXXX."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""OK perfect. Let me just make sure that appointment is."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""Solidify before you go and confirm the email because what is going to happen is you are going to get what we call an electronic letter of authorization confirming the number and the email address that we have is BEBSG@aol.com."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""That is a good email? OK, just wanted to make sure so quick recap what we are doing is we are coming out."" [Customer] ""It is a good email."" [Agent] ""It is XXX South Street. This is in freehold"" [Customer] ""we are going to be adding a line The additional cost on your monthly would be $40. The one time fee, sir, for the technician to come out would be $79.99 dollars, and that is placed on the bill. You do not have to give any money. To the tech and there is no contracts and just so you are aware we do offer mobile service now for business so that is a way to save some money on your Optimum account we have unlimited mobile plans as low as $45 a month but then you would actually save $15 on your business account, OK? So it is something to, uh, keep in mind and we are part of the largest XG network. So the mobile number is good all over the state. Yes, so the network that we utilize for mobile service is T-Mobile, in case you are wondering what the network is, but it would be, it is nationwide. I have used it in Georgia, you know, uh, Florida, California, so we are, you know, nationwide the service is great Since the yeah since T-Mobile is. As free international calls, right? So no international would be handled on a per call basis you would have to add an international plan say if you were going to travel. Uh Alright, so. Uh, I do have some time right now. I am driving. OK. Uh, What is? My bill XXX when I am getting the lowest. Uh, Steve. Hold on, let us take a look here. So you are probably out of a promotion or whatever promotion that you started with originally, uh, that ended. Well, actually I, I had static IP. Mhm. And then I changed it. So it should be the lowest. Price Well, you are at the lowest bandwidth you are also out of a promotion on your account, like your actual optimum account is out of a promotion Because I changed If that makes sense. OK. I mean if you were looking to lower the bill may mobile would be one way that I could offer you a reduction on the bill by switching over your mobile service I could save you some money in other areas. So Uh, no, let us try like your standard. Basic, uh, business phone line right now this internet line. OK. How much is it? OK are you asking about new customer pricing or? Yes. OK, so if you were to do a XXX connection, that is XXX megabits down and XX or XX $50 up I should say, coax it would be $65 a month for one year. No customer price It is just a X year price guarantee and then the phone lines if you were to do a bundle, I could tell you what that would be. Bear with me. You have two phone lines. You would be looking at about $100 for one year. And then after one year it goes to the standard, uh, the standard pricing. For everything For for two lines and the uh the lowest. Uh, Internet, which is coax, that is correct sir. Correct What do you mean coax uh? Well, that is the type of connection that you have now. Well So with the coax, um, the speeds can, you know, vary depending on how many users you have utilizing the Internet, the time of day, how many devices whereas with the fiber, the fiber would be a guaranteed connection you would be getting guaranteed speeds there You would be getting symmetrical speed. How much is the fiber? So what I was offering you was a fiber upgrade, uh, the phone line and the fiber upgrade, the whole thing would have came to $80 more you would be getting, you know, more than like triple the speed of what you currently have The bonus speed. That is correct sir. But you have a XXX. Megabyte speed too, right? Like X gig is is one of your max. X gig is the fastest, uh yes, if you wanted to, did you want to hear what a XXX fiber would be Yes Yes. So we do not charge more for fiber than coax just so you know because some customers think we do um there is no we charge more for fiber so if fiber is available in your area, we would offer fiber just because it is, you know, the better connection so to speak. So We do not have any fiber in our area. You do. So that is why I quoted you fiber. You do have fiber in this area. Oh So that is why I uh quoted fiber I could tell you if you wanted to do like a XXX fiber as opposed to a gig I could tell you what that would be. Bear with me. Yes. And so where the fiber rates were coming up before and now they are not so we are just saying. If I can add man on. It is so all of the fibroids are not coming up. Uh, it is really weird. They were just coming up. Let us see if I could just tell you what the difference would be so this way if it is something you wanted to move forward with. Uh, no, no, I am more interested in pricing. Yeah, no, I know I am just trying to figure out the price because for some reason the rates are not populating now and they were earlier. I am not sure if it is because we put through the change for the phone, so I am just going to try to tell you what the rates would be and try to manually do it for you. Yes. So if you were to upgrade to like the XXX fiber, the cost difference would be $50 instead of $80. $50 a month. More, yeah, and that would be for the line and the XXX fiber. With the line Mhm. Uh Explain that. So where we be porting the phone line from your, yeah, so your bill would increase by $50 instead of $40 you would be getting the faster connection here, so you would be having a fiber connection So what is the total bill with fiber? Uh, so from XX it becomes XX. That is correct. Right? And then you add the phone line. But you That is including the phone line, sir. That is including the phone line. That is what is the monthly bill then? Let us see here, so your monthly bill now. It is just by adding the phone line, I could tell you. So your total monthly bill right now sir would be XXX. Well, can you break it down to XX? So the phone lines are $40 each. OK, so that is $80 for the voice, and then your internet, uh, let us see. XXX minus XX. Your internet charges are XXX sir. Uh, XXX, so, uh, XXX megabyte is XXX. That is correct. Right now you have a XXX megabytes coax and that is XXX. So if I choose fiber XXX. With the new uh contract, how much is that? So it is not a contract, it would be just an upgrade promotion and your bill would increase by $50 so I was giving you a promotion and that is including the phone line. So if I were to sign up. You It is XXXXX phone lines. How much is it? So if you were to do the half a gig, hold on, I will tell you. You would be with with auto pay you would be at XXX without auto pay you would be about $140 a month. With auto pay is XXX. That is correct. If you were looking to lower your overall optimum bill, you could always speak with our retention group when you had a chance, and they would be able to review your account so that is the department that would be able to maybe, uh, you know, if they could lower your bill. Retention group so I could get a lower bill. Yeah Well, I am just saying if you were looking to have it be more in line with new customer pricing. Then XXX. Uh So But later on if I if I were to support my numbers again somewhere that $40 will go away. That is correct if you poured out again, yes. Because you switch providers. Uh Right. So right now, why do not we do the uh. Fiber at XXX. OK, I am going to just get my support team on the line to assist for some reason the fiber rates are not populating for me, but I can get them on the line to see if they can assist. They could Um Yeah, is it OK if I. You can lower it further. Uh So it is an upgrade so I do not have the ability to lower the bill because this is the sales department unfortunately that is why I was saying if you were looking to get like a lower rate you could speak with our retention group. I am sorry, sir did I lose you No Oh I am here. Yeah, so did you, uh, for some reason I would have to get sales escalations involved now because now the fiber rates are not populating they were previously, uh, would it be OK if I called you back? Uh, call me back Once I have the order once I have the order placed, did you want to go ahead and upgrade uh to the the fiber because we may have to cancel, they may have to help me modify the additional or the original order to get the fiber in there for you. OK, so do you have the numbers in front of you now? Sure, I just want to confirm XXXXXXXXXX. Yeah, that is my number, yep. Yeah, I just want to confirm once I have the fiber rates added for the XXX. OK, you can call me. Yeah. Can you do it in XX minutes? Sure, I am going to reach out to my sales escalations. They are going to need to assist me. OK, I just want to make sure and then I can call you back and recap it with you. And uh. Right And your number would be XXX. It would be an XXX number, yes. It is uh which location and I will pick it up if uh. Uh, I am not sure. It is, it is just going to come through with the XXX number. It may say optimum. Alright, I will It does not say so I will just take a chance. Yeah, I will call you back shortly, sir, OK? But yeah OK Thank you. Alright have a great day."""

So if someone calls you when it is right, if someone calls you when it is busy, it rolls over to the second line."" [Customer] ""Well, well."" [Agent] ""Yep, perfect."" [Customer] ""Yeah Verizon."" [Agent] ""Now, um, who is your provider now, Verizon or AT&T? Who is your and OK, and you are not happy with them, or is the service to what is for"" [Customer] ""I Oh, no, actually I have been down for this would be X days. I have no service."" [Agent] ""Oh wow."" [Customer] ""And you can not, I can not get, you are on the phone for 2.5 hours on hold and it, it just I am not getting anywhere so I am done"" [Agent] ""Right, it is hard, no, it is hard. I mean, I am in Long Island right now, so it is local, you know, you call me in Brentwood, so it is I keep calling, so if something were to happen, you know, with us, we are there within X to X hours to fix the issue."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""We have people local all over the all over Long Island. Um, uh, you know, I am sorry for that we will definitely help you Uh, um, now the telephone numbers are called porting when you can port the telephones and keep the same telephone numbers."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""OK, that is fine. In terms of internet, are you going to have credit card machines? Are you going to have laptops?"" [Customer] ""Yeah Yeah, it is the computer and yeah, it has a credit card machine and it also has my wire service tele for that comes through it."" [Agent] ""Are you going to have a lot all the above? Mhm. Perfect. So the great thing about this location is that we offer fiber. So the fiber is extremely fast and reliable and the speed of the it is XGB which is XXXX megs upload and XXXX megs download. So pretty much extremely fast and it is fiber. I will break down the bill. um, so the internet portion of the bill is $125. And then the telephone uh $30 a line. So if you have X lines, it is $90. So it is $90 for X telephone lines and then $125 for the internet all together it is $215 a month. And then, and that is pretty much it, uh, because you get in a double play, the installation is free there are no of course fees And I can put a rush job on it and see how fast we can go and fix you know, and install the service How does that sound?"" [Customer] ""Mhm. Yeah, it is a high, it seems like."" [Agent] ""But, I mean, you are getting, you know, you are getting that, you are getting the best, you are paying for the the best service It is X gig fiber. That is why it is $125. I do not know what speed of internet you have now. Do you know what speed internet you have?"" [Customer] ""No, no."" [Agent] ""Yeah, see, with us it is one gig fiber. That is what you, I mean you are paying for it. That is why it is so, it is so strong. And if something were to happen with us in the in the situation, our modem. Has XG uh cell phone tower. So if there is an outage in the area, our modems automatically kick in and your cell phone towers for up to X hours in case we have an outage. So if that something would happen with us, we come to fix your issue within X to X hours and our cell phone our modem kicks in to uses Wi Fi towers So your credit card machines will still work even though you had a modem, even though you have an outage, whereas Verizon, you know, X or X days, look how much money you are losing by not having internet. That would not happen with us because of our, our Wi Fi modems. And uh a cell phone power modems so you are paying for the value, you know."" [Customer] ""Right, that"" [Agent] ""Now here is the situation we would have to request Verizon to give us the telephone numbers."" [Customer] ""Right"" [Agent] ""So the balls in their court in terms of how fast we can go because we we would, you know, you want to obviously keep the same telephone number that Verizon has so we have to report it called porting when we report the numbers over."" [Customer] ""I Right."" [Agent] ""So it, it is up to that. I mean, I will let you know in X minutes how fast it will release the numbers, but it is up to them to release the numbers. It might take a day, usually it takes X days for Verizon to release it sometimes too. Do you know what the XX telephone numbers are that you want to pour over?"" [Customer] ""Um, I, I only know two of them, I think. I just see like, like one is still."" [Agent] ""Sure, take your time."" [Customer] ""So one is XXX. XXXX And one is XXXXXXX. Not sure what the one is for the computer."" [Agent] ""The, the, the, when you say computer, you mean for like the credit card machine?"" [Customer] ""The credit card machine and Of the internet that comes in for tele and my wire services."" [Agent] ""OK, yeah, I think you are, I mean I do not know if you can change that number I am not sure because I know, uh, you know, if when my technician will go there he will set up the your credit card machines and all that with our service, but I am not sure if it had to be the same number it could be a new number.""

[Customer] ""I"" [Agent] ""Yeah, like um like fingers are crossed, it is up to them to release the number, you know. Hopeful it ASAP.

I have."" [Agent] ""You, you know what you can, it is up, you know what you can do."" [Customer] ""That is my big problem. My biggest holiday is in like XX days, Mother's Day. I am, I am already losing all these orders because I can not get any internet."" [Agent] ""You know what you can do? We can install the Internet ASAP. And once the internet is installed, we can port the numbers over. You know what I am saying?"" [Customer] ""Um,"" [Agent] ""So we I can put in the order let me see how, let me see how long it is just to install the internet, OK?"" [Customer] ""Yeah"" [Agent] ""Hold on. Because, because we still have to do the porting anyway I, I can get the internet there, you know, let us see if we can get the internet there as soon as possible then we can port the numbers After we install it."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""That is, you know, let me see, let me, give me a second, let me see what that does. Because Verizon does that because they do not want to lose business they do not want to lose you, you know, they do not want us. They do not want to lose you as a customer because they just wait a week."" [Customer] ""Yeah, well, the problem that, you know, I already told them that this started on Thursday."" [Agent] ""They do it all the time."" [Customer] ""Spoke to him Thursday, spoke to them Friday, literally been on the phone for over X hours on hold trying to get to speak to somebody and all you get is, you know, oh we are working on it."" [Agent] ""Mhm Yeah. It is horrible."" [Customer] ""I am like, yeah, but that is not helping me."" [Agent] ""It is not helping you right, right, right."" [Customer] ""You are not telling me what is happening and you are telling me the service will be up by X o'clock and now we are on day X and I still have no service and no one's come by or nobody's looked at it but now like nothing."" [Agent] ""Let me see if we go there and I think."" [Customer] ""My phone lines are working. It is my internet that is not working."" [Agent] ""Right, I am sorry, because, OK, so let, hold on. We can put the internet then we can port the numbers over, you know"" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""We can go this Wednesday XX or X I can put a request in for tomorrow"" [Customer] ""Um, you know what, I will not be, uh, what, what is today? Today is Monday."" [Agent] ""We have Wednesday XX or X or X to X or Thursday the 1st X to XXXX."" [Customer] ""For Wednesday? Wednesday Wednesday is fine. I will be there all day Wednesday."" [Agent] ""So, so let us recap what I am going to do is I am going to install the internet and X temporary telephone numbers. Once we are installed Wednesday, then, um, we can call you can call back and say you want to port the numbers, and then we will do the process of porting the numbers over and then we can go back and port the numbers over afterwards. But for now we can just install the internet with X temporary telephone numbers so you will have service. OK."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""I am going to give you your account number. Your account number is XXX. XX-dash. XXX. XXX XX. And it is $2150 free installation for X telephone lines and the fastest internet that we offer with the Wi Fi with the backup Wi Fi. Um, and then once you are installed everything's settled, if you want to call back Thursday or Friday and say hi, I just got X temporary telephone numbers Can you do the process to report the numbers over we will do that at least for now we will"" [Customer] ""So do OK, one question, I am not even positive that other one is, or is that a telephone line or it run through the internet."" [Agent] ""It might not be a telephone line."" [Customer] ""I, I, I got a feeling it may just be run through the internet."" [Agent] ""OK, so if, if we remove the telephone, it would be cheaper. Hold on. I think so too, and you can always add it in the future if you want."" [Customer] ""I am almost Yeah."" [Agent] ""It would be cheaper. Hold on, perfect. So we are going to give you X temporary telephone numbers then once you are installed everything is working then you have time, you can call us back and say I got X temporary telephone numbers I need to port my, my Verizon numbers over.""
