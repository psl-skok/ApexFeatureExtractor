[Agent] ""So instead of calling us, let us say XX months down the line to add a number which would be about $45 right now you would get it for like $25."" [Customer] ""Right, I thought it was good."" [Agent] ""I, I am still going to look out for a better deal for you anyways. Are you going to do auto pay paperless billing?"" [Customer] ""Yeah"" [Agent] ""OK, um, I am going to try to get you this for less than XX. Let me see if I can add another promotion for you. Give me a sec.""

[Agent] ""I could, I could be there Wednesday morning."" [Customer] ""That is perfect."" [Agent] ""X to XX."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""All right, uh, I did want to mention one last thing. I, I know this is some sort of lounge, um. Now we, we do offer this product it is called the pro Wi Fi. Are your guests logging into your Wi Fi?"" [Customer] ""Well, we just opened so probably yeah they would probably have that. I just do not want it we have not done it because it is been interfering with our feet so."" [Agent] ""This is exactly what the pro Wi Fi does. It is specifically for like restaurants, coffee shops, things like this. I will explain it to you. If you think it is a good fit, I, I recommend it just for these type of businesses. I am not going to recommend it for a mechanic you know, but um So let, let us say I am a guest at your lounge. Instead of me asking for your password I would see, you know, your business name I will log in. You set it up as to what you want, what information you want from your guest, you know their name, their phone number, their email, all that information gets captured, right And that gets stored. So let us say for example, I went, I signed in, you can manage how long I am on the internet for or on the Wi Fi, XX minutes, an hour, whatever the case is. And out of the X gig that we provide you, you can only limit your guests to maybe XXX Mbps or XXX, whatever the case is. That way they are not using all of your internet, if that makes sense. That is one factor. The other factor that is pretty cool is let us say you have a special on a Wednesday, you want to email blast your guest You already have my information saved. You can email me, hey, uh, Wednesday we have 50% off wine, 50% off desserts, whatever the case is It is a really cool feature. You manage it from however you want, you know. How long I could be on there for. You, you upload images of your specials on there. Let us say I went and I left and I want to take a look and go back. I could see everything. Uh, it is, and you manage it from beginning to end when a cus when a guest is there."" [Customer] ""What So we can get the name and number if they choose to um."" [Agent] ""Yeah, and you, you manage that."" [Customer] ""So whenever they log in we we can we can yeah we can get their info."" [Agent] ""You can even"" [Customer] ""What is it called again?"" [Agent] ""Oh yeah, you can, you can manage it even more. You can ask for age you know, male or female, whatever you want to add on there Those are all options. Sometimes you just want their name and phone number. Great, you want their email, you can add it. you want their age you can see what kind of age group you are getting You can add that too however you want You manage the whole thing. And then all that that is called pro Wi Fi."" [Customer] ""Right, and what is it called?"" [Agent] ""It is uh that service is 39.99."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Um, it is month to month. So let us say you tried it out and you realize, hey, you know what, we are not really using it. You can always call and remove it, you know, it will bring your bill back down to where you know And you do get a training on it, you know, our technicians show you exactly how to use it. You have a technical support team, they will help you manage it, how to upload images of your logo and things like that. It, it is pretty cool. Again, I only recommend it for like restaurants, lounges, coffee shops, things like that. Other than that, I will not recommend it to like a law office, you know uh, things of that nature"" [Customer] ""Right, no, of course."" [Agent] ""But um it is definitely a very popular option you could use it as an advertising tool as well. That would bring your bill."" [Customer] ""Alright, yeah, yeah, let us do it."" [Agent] ""So for uh and I got the phone number for less, so XXX with the number we had the pro Wi Fi XXXX XXXXX."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""OK, give me a sec. Just give me a second, we will wrap this up. Is there a specific phone number I can give the technician to call half an hour before showing up?"" [Customer] ""Yeah Oh yeah, that number is fine. I will give him I will give you another number too It is uh XXX."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""XXX-XXXX"" [Agent] ""Got it I will, I will mention one last thing. You know, I do not want to bombard you with all these specials. Um, in case you want to use a cell phone for your business, if you want to just simply text or call your guest we have unlimited talk and text for $15 OK"" [Customer] ""Mm."" [Agent] ""Um, we also have unlimited data. That is $45 but if you become an unlimited customer,"" [Customer] ""Right"" [Agent] ""Go ahead."" [Customer] ""That is for that is for separate cellphone service, right?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, that is a cell phone plan, yeah, it is called Optimum Mobile.

[Agent] ""Yeah, right, uh, that, that is what I was saying I do not want to bombard you , uh, if you do become a customer for mobile, you save $30 off of your internet bill, OK Just, just so you have that in mind.""

Yeah, no problem."" [Agent] ""OK, and then just a quick recap what we are going to be doing is we are coming out it is XXXX Rockaway Avenue, and this is in Lynnbrook, New York, and we are going to be installing a X gig fiber connection so you are getting guaranteed speeds that is X gig up, X gig down."" [Customer] ""Yeah Mhm."" [Agent] ""You do get a fail over with that as well. So say if there is an optimum outage, you will still have business continuity. For example, you could still take payments and it, it will not affect your money or your business coming in. You also get premium protection at a $30 value. So if you need assistance setting up your cameras, your point of sale, it is all included. It is like having your own personal geek squad at your disposal."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""The one time set up fee, sir, is $100 but that is placed on the bill. You do not have to give any money to the tech there is no contracts This is a X year price guarantee. You can cancel service with us at any time."" [Customer] ""Uh, let me ask a question, you said this is for one day."" [Agent] ""Yeah we do not want you to."" [Customer] ""You said this is for one gig. Is there anything more?"" [Agent] ""Uh, so we can actually do a XGB. I will tell you what a X gig would be."" [Customer] ""Yeah, how much is the XGB going to be?"" [Agent] ""Hold on, let me tell you. And the XGB would actually give you the fastest fiber motor. So once you go XGB or XGB, it would give you the fastest modem that we offer if that makes sense."" [Customer] ""Yeah, so how much is the X gigabyte price?"" [Agent] ""Um,"" [Customer] ""The XGB price?"" [Agent] ""Sure, I am going to tell you right now, bear with me and I will try to go back and adjust it for you. So sorry, I am just going back. So if we did let us see, take away the internet, take away the one gig. Put in X days. And let me just see what the discount with the XGB would be."" [Customer] ""No, X gigabyte is fine. That is cool."" [Agent] ""OK, and the XGB it actually would be a XX month price guarantee as well."" [Customer] ""Yeah, it is OK. If anything, I will upgrade it to X gigabytes later on."" [Agent] ""Are you sure? um, because it, you know, I can."" [Customer] ""Yeah, it is OK. I am going to stick with X gigabyte for now."" [Agent] ""OK, no worries, sir, so you would be at the XXX, and is there anything else that I can help you with?"" [Customer] ""Alright, no problem. Um, no, just a quick recap. Wednesday around X to XX a.m. you said, right?"" [Agent] ""That is correct, and they will call you half an hour prior."" [Customer] ""Alright, OK, no problem perfect."" [Agent] ""Just so you have a better ETA, you will get a reminder call the night before, um, just to confirm the appointment and on the actual day of the install they will call you a half hour before so you have a better ETA, OK?""

What we call the M Drive and I can not I can not access my M Drive remotely at my house without a business account so I am going to need a router too is that. Does that sound right?

Alright, so yeah, the X gig actually will you pay $105 with a $110 with taxes, so your your cost will actually remain the same The only thing that we would have to add is the static IP which is $20 for the business account, so your bill will be $20 more on the business account OK, when you say that static IP, that is, is that a an individual router router by itself? Like Uh, is there, yeah, it is an individual individual router and then it is, uh, it is. You know what I mean?

I do not know why they would, uh, why you would need it. I mean, this is what most people use and, and, and, you know, especially that it comes with that static IP, um, so let me just go. Yeah. Well, basically, basically what they require is is I would, I would disconnect from my current internet and then connect to that router separate is what they are saying so. Mhm. I do not know. I will give it a shot, see if it works. No, I will just have to go get a wireless router. It is fine because they are not, they are not that expensive. OK.

Yeah, it is really fast uh the only thing um um I need to do is set up a password for you has to be X numbers Mm. Uh, do XXXX. What Now I just have to let you know and ask you if you want to take advantage of these two add-ons that you can do uh with a business account you can get a backup unit. It is a failover device in case of any outage. The internet will still continue to work at a little bit slower speeds because it will use cell towers to give you internet, but it is just in case of emergency, in case of an outage. Uh, it is a $30 add on if you are interested on that. Um, I No, I am, I am not. I got, I got a hotspot on my phone, so. Uh, yeah, so basically that it would do the almost the same type of features, um, and then the other thing is uh for your phone. Right Uh No, I am not interested. I do not know who you use for your cell phone, but you because you have a business account, you have a discount, major discount with us, you get an unlimited mobile plan like a unlimited cell phone plan for just $5 So that is another perk that you can have with us.

I may have to, to look your, your Instagram up and read up on it a little bit more. Um. I just opened it, yeah, like it is, it is all like I am still in school for the massage therapy part my Instagram looks like crap Mhm. My sister's going to help me put it together because it sucks. I am like, I really, I do not know how to do this part. I know how to do all the technical stuff that I am trying to put out there. Well there you go.

They had a they had a queas in car so my problem. And then a year and there is other. When are you, when are you when are you opening up if you do not mind me asking. Tomorrow. Um, in the next week, I, I can do that other, that part, and then in a year, I am going to have a massage therapist in the office until I can do it until I get my license. Mhm. OK. And even then we will have two of us, and most likely one of my classmates, so we will have X massage therapists there. Beautiful. Nice. Well, here is to you and your goals. May they come to fruition. Thank you. Congratulations, um. Exciting. Thank you. OK, let me that so. No, all I need is Wi Fi so I can play the music while I am working. I hear you that you need that Spotify. You need to go ahead and make sure you have your cameras to keep everybody orderly. Mhm. You need to have your credit card terminal going. That is fine. The what? I got you. I got you I got you. OK, so let me ask you a question just so I know what I am putting together for you so I can make sure that we are putting the best, um, foot forward, the best promos together kind of situation. It is No TV. Um, we can provide TV service, internet service, phone service, all of the above. Now, as far as the service are you going to have a TV in maybe like the waiting area or anything like that, maybe news or something like that playing in the movie? I, I just mean. I just really need Wi Fi, but I still, I, I do not know if the bundle of X that I saw online that you can get like phone and email for. Something that is not really expensive. Phone and internet. Yeah, that one, sorry. OK, no, no, no, it is OK, it is OK, just making sure that you know it is the internet service because we do not provide emails, but we do provide the internet service through which you can receive through which you can receive your emails so you know, I, I, I literally just have to go ahead and make sure I say it correctly because it is one of those things I do not want to mislead the customer into just, you know. Yeah, that is what I meant, that is not. Mm. That kind of thing, um, OK, ma'am, that is all, um, what I am going to do is I am going to go ahead and price it out to you, including the internet service, of course your dial tone so that you have, um, the best promotions possible because it does include a phone number where it gives you a deeper discount on the internet service to help us set the pricing structure of the phone. OK. It will include your modem, your router, and it will also include your premier technical support so that if you need any assistance with networking any of your devices, you do not have to worry. Yeah. You can call us, we will be happy to help you network them over the phone and it will also include um any trouble calls that you may have. We will not. You will not get charged for trouble calls to send a technician out to your location. That is very important when you have a small business you are trying to go ahead and make, you know, the most out of your money and your investment OK Oh Yeah, yeah. So let me go ahead and work on the rest of this so that I can go ahead and price it out accordingly we will see when we can send somebody out there Um, do you already have a, do you already have electricity at the location? OK perfect. I have been there X years. Um, well, OK. Yeah, I am switching careers. OK. Mm. Yeah, like just like. OK, just bear with me a few here. And Make sure I am not missing any codes. OK, so the system is giving us a X year promotion at this time. Again, no contract, no cancellation charges. So whenever you want to go ahead and disconnect, you just return your equipment and you are so it. The installation is a one time charge of $100 and that gets billed out to you. The pricing structure, as I mentioned is going to include that phone number, that modem, the router, the premier technical support, your connection failover service. So if for any reason, um, there is an issue with the main internet service, it will automatically switch over to the failover service so you can continue to book your appointments. You have your main computer, your cameras, you can connect it to the uh primary X devices on that fail over service to the LTE network until we get out there and fix the main issue now. Normally, um, we would go ahead and have a package like for the gig speed of service and everything with what I am offering you. The package would normally be $240 but right now with the fact that we are doing the. Gig speed of service at the XXX speed price and we are including a $30 multi multi-product discount. The monthly rate would be $160 that once again is a X year promotion without any contracts or cancellation charges So giving you your normal discounts plus your gig speed of service at the XXX speed and your $30 in multi-product discounts, it would be $160 I can let you know in just a few moments how quickly I can get somebody out there Let me know how that sounds to you. There is a lower speed though, right? That is a little bit more economical because I am really just going to have a Lea plane. OK, so there is, there is a lower speed because right now we are giving the gig speed of service at the XXX speed price, the price difference between getting the gig speed of service and the XXX speed, the difference is $10 That you do not have So I can go ahead and bring it down to half the speed, like X gig is XXXX megs, XXX megs versus XX. What, what is it without, without the phone then cause I do not, I do not really want to spend that much. Um, it would be $15 difference, um, because normally the phone is $40 right now you are getting it for $25 you are getting a $10 multi-product discount So if you want me to take it off I can and that removes $15 from your account. As a heads up, if you want to do autopay and paperless, that also gives you an additional $5 discount for autopay and paperless. Mm. So what is the, what would be the number on that? So if I was to go ahead and take off the phone, that would go ahead and bring your XXX down by XX to XXX then you can also set up without the phone Use the phone does not make a difference. Yeah, I mean, because we are giving such deep discounts, it is like the price differences like we are talking about $10.15 dollars or more then you could also add an additional $5 discount for auto pay and paperless if you wanted to do, um, if you wanted to sign up for autopay and paperless after OK. OK. Can you tell me, am I, am I keeping the phone? Am I taking it off? Yeah, yeah, they, yeah, so what what you originally said $15 is not going to make or break I would rather not have people calling me I. OK. That is a very good way of separating church and state, um absolutely, cause, you know sometimes you just want to be able to mindlessly scroll through Instagram You want to be able to just relax in the, you know, pin the recipes that we are never going to cook, you know, do all of that fun stuff, all the meals that we are going to do at brunch that all your friends forget. I know I sound a little affected by that, but that is fine. So the technician is going to call this XXX-XXX-XXXX. Before they get there to confirm that they are on their way. Mhm. I can give you Friday between the hours of X to XX or XX to X. OK. Mhm Um, X to XX. OK, so that means it can show up at any time between the hours of X to XX to begin working. Is that OK with you? That, yeah, that is fine. OK, perfect. So we are going to do that X to XX. I am going to need a X digit access code for your account. What four digits would you like to use? XXXX. XXXX. X, that is my sister's birthday. Oh XXXX. Oh Exactly, yeah. She is a tax baby. Yeah, text them. Yup, yup, yup. She was actually born on Easter Sunday, so it is always one of those floating kind of days. So she was born on tax day and Easter Sunday, so, you know, good stuff. Um, let us take a look. I am going to go ahead and recap the order with you. I am going to give you your complete account number and I will give you the phone number the technical support so that you can give them a ring to make sure that you get your, uh, web portal up and going. Let me know if you have um a pen and paper handy if you want to open up your notes app. I do. Beautiful. Yeah, I got pen and paper. Perfect. Perfect. Do you choose the phone number now? The system generates the phone number. Does it generate that Right. The system generates the phone number, and it is given to you on the date of installation once it is approved by XXX service. Please keep in mind that the business that the system knows that it is for a business, so it tries to pull user friendly numbers, repeating digits, that kind of thing. Mm. So we take that very much into consideration. OK. So we try to do that as much as we can. Alright then, so right now I am scheduling an appointment for you. OK, sounds good. Uh, for May 2nd between the hours of X to XX over at XXX City Island Avenue, Suite X, Bronx, New York, your installation will be billed out $100. Your monthly reoccurring charges are $160. Your estimated tax is $8.01. This is going to be for your gig speed of service with your premier technical support at the XX. You have your modem, your router your connection failover service at your XX You have your phone number. You have your multi-product discounts you have a X year promotion without any contracts or cancellation charges Please know that the complete terms and conditions which contain binding arbitrary provisions are available at harian.com/optimum terms and will be sent to you via email. By enrolling, you agree to these important details and the terms and conditions, um, please confirm that you would like to enroll in the premier technical support, and I just need a verbal confirmation for that. Yes, please. Thank you. I have your access code as XXXX I have your account number as XXX XX. Dash XX XX XX. XX. OK, so just to reiterate, XXXXX-XXXXXX-XX and send the technician out there prepared to do a full installation for you. Got it. Um, this is a new account. I mean the the location is serviceable. I am sending them out there to do a fiber check to ensure that the wiring is the way that it says that it should be. Um, if for any reason they see additional work needs to be done, they will go ahead and advise and reschedule the appointment. But for now, um, we should be good to go on the service as far as the, um, checks are concerned, um, meaning the checks at the pole for the location. Got it. The phone number to technical support is XXX-XXX-XXXX. OK. And you are going to give them a call after you are installed, and they will help you create your online web portal, OK, that is so that you have access to the account online, you are able to set up your features, your voicemail, you are able to go ahead and, um, listen, you know, just make sure you have all your ducks in a row in that level of service. Now can I ask you please what is it that you are doing for your cellular service? Go it. What do you currently have as your carrier? I, I have. T-Mobile, I have X lines. OK, that works. So Optimum uses T-Mobile as their towers for our cellular service with Optimum Mobile. I can go ahead and make this a really simple pitch. I am going to go ahead and just give you the following numbers. So right now we are at XXX. If you were to add one phone number with Optimum. It would be $47 for an unlimited line with unlimited talk, text, data with XX gigs of premium data. That makes your monthly rate $207 you get $40 off on your internet service when you go ahead and have cellular service with an unlimited line with us So that makes it $167 and that is including the taxes on your cellular service. So basically, $7 more and you got a business cell phone. If you have X lines and this is Why is it so cheap? Because there is no contract with Optimum Mobile. What is the catch? They use T-Mobile towers so you are familiar with the service The catch, I would not call it a catch, is the fact that it is our own product. Mhm. So we are taking a hit on the internet pricing structure because we want you to try out our cellular service, and this is not a temporary, um, you know, a discount or anything like that. You have a cellular service with an unlimited line. You have our gig speed of service. You get an extra $40 off on the internet service. That is literally what it is. Now you have X lines. So for XXX. So basically, yeah, because it is $160. Yeah. You the the taxes on this account I had told you was $8 at $47 for your cellular service on one line that is $215 actually because I want to make sure since I am adding the taxes on the cell phone that I also add the taxes on the internet. It is $215 minus $40 you are still at $175. You are literally at XXX. Now let us take this a little bit further. Do you know how much you are paying for your X lines? Monthly? XXX. Once you have X lines or more, I am sorry X lines or more with optimum because we can do up to. XX lines. Once you have X lines or more, those $45 lines come down to $25. So you are literally at XX times X. That is XX. What is the catch? There is no account again, that is the price. That is our multi-product discount. That is literally our multi-line savings. That $45 line goes down to, if you only, let us say you have two lines, it goes down to $30 and if you have X lines or more, then it goes down to $25. So it is literally XX times X. That is $125. The taxes on X lines. Let us say it is $15. It is usually about $2 and change. Let us exaggerate a little. Let us say that it is $15. That right there is going to be $25 plus the $2 in taxes. That is $27 times X. That is about $135. Let us say XXX minus the $40 that you get on the internet service. Literally, if you are paying $300 and change, now my question is, are you paying off phones within that money? Um, my daughter, I just got her a new phone. So remember I am talking about just strictly the cell phone service. Um, I am not talking about, you know, the actual phones or anything like that. I want to make sure that we are on the same page because if we are talking apples to apples, just the, just the calling, the data, that kind of thing. That is what I am offering. I am offering you unlimited talk, text, unlimited data with XX gigs of premium data. If you are in a location where you consistently have Wi Fi, you turn the Wi Fi on so you are using your data while you are out and about But when you are in the office, your data is on, so you are good to go. Is that to be true. Um I literally you can literally go on our website right now Optimum Mobile you will see the pricing structure going up But then I have to pay for phones, right? No, you can you can bring your phones over It is called bring your own device. You read to me the IMEI numbers I am able to go ahead and um confirm that the phone numbers are compatible with our I am sorry, that the physical phones are compatible with ours I mean, if you have anything above an iPhone, I think it is like X or so, it is compatible with us, so we send you a SIM card. If you have, uh, you know, a device that has an eSIM then we just send you a new SIM. The activation for each phone. It is $20 plus the taxes maybe about $20.50 That is what it would be due on the time of activation. So My niece is on my account she has an iPhone X. Mm, I do not think a X would work. I think it has to be an X or above to tell you. I, I would check the IMEI number and it would tell me that it is if it is compatible or not. We can start this off with just one phone you get that extra $40 off and basically the phone would be literally, basically about $7 Mm. Yeah.

Yeah, I am, I am I am trying to find that number"" [Agent] ""Yeah, if you go if you go with that it would be. XXX for the Internet. The office line. The cell phone, the the connection back up because I always put that on my accounts for customers because in case there is an outage of service be up and running at all times because just, you know, you, you are having issues now a premium tech support so in case we have to come out there, we come out there the same day at no cost You are you are going to be saving. I am not counting the cell phone service with your family plan but just overall."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, no."" [Agent] ""You you are you are, you are ahead of the game You are going to be saving a couple $100."" [Customer] ""Yeah, so I kind of, I kind of figured that. So, so that is for X phones now I have X computers"" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""So do I need two separate modems can I put a wire or list thing I run another wire to the other computer or something"" [Agent] ""No. Yes. You are going to we are going to give you a modem and a wireless router so that you can go with the X computers so you do not need X extra And the technician will set that up for you."" [Customer] ""OK, so they, they will run the wire all the way to the back room or what actually it is just do they use the old. Like there is cable wire here, are they going to run all new wire or is this?"" [Agent] ""So, It depends on, it depends on the line."" [Customer] ""Um, Right, but there is the line that line is, is, is being used for somebody else's stuff now."" [Agent] ""The technician has to test that line if that line is working, he will use the existing line if he feels he needs to run it, he will run it. That is all part of the installation which is only $100. So he will he will run a new line for you that is not a problem."" [Customer] ""So he would have to run a new line."" [Agent] ""Yeah Yeah they are good like that."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I am trying to get separated."" [Agent] ""They will whatever you need yeah, whatever you need to get done to make your stuff work is what the technician will do for you"" [Customer] ""Alright, so I actually I just pulled this thing up here. So what is the internet secure thing? I see there is like XXX, XXX, XGB."" [Agent] ""I am giving you one gig because it is a promotion that is not advertised because you are coming from Verizon, so it is so it is the highest internet speed."" [Customer] ""Uh"" [Agent] ""Believe it or not."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""It is a X year promotion."" [Customer] ""And then what does it go to after the X years?"" [Agent] ""Call us because we are in the business of not losing customers, so call us if we have to modify to fit your budget we will always do that."" [Customer] ""Yeah, cause I mean, for instance, Verizon, I used to be at $60 then the two years was up I called them, they kept me at the same. The next two years, it went to XXX and they would not do anything."" [Agent] ""Yeah, no, we do, we always we do not we are, we are a small little business on our department so we, our retention department is fabulous We will always help you. And as a consumer that is when you call if you do not, you know, if we can not help you, not to say that we will not, we will you know then you have every right as a consumer to go to another provider"" [Customer] ""Well, that is kind of what I am doing because I am set up."" [Agent] ""But we Yeah. Yeah, but we will always help you."" [Customer] ""I was just worried. I did not know I could take my number. I had the same number for what, 19 years. I kind of do not want to XXXX I do not know"" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""I know long enough that I can not, I do not want to lose my number."" [Agent] ""You will, yeah no, you always will, you always will I am going to send you an email once we are done. There is an email, so it is an, it is an LOA form that you need to fill out like to say that the number is correct and then you send it back and that is when we start the process of porting the telephone number over, make sure that it works."" [Customer] ""OK, and then how much does this cost me to do?"" [Agent] ""So yeah. The installation is only a one time fee of $100 and we will run all the lines that needs to get run for you."" [Customer] ""So I have to pay that at the time or you guys send me a bill for that with the first bill or another bill?"" [Agent] ""Oh. I, I send you a bill. No, we will send you on on your bill. You do not have to pay anything upfront."" [Customer] ""OK, and then as far as like these cameras, so I have to find out because."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""They are not technically my cameras. I kind of, I guess you would say rent them. If that can be transferred over, you guys hook that up also. I, I do not know what is involved with like I think it is just kind of plug one in and plug one in."" [Agent] ""Yeah, like the cameras there."" [Customer] ""Do they, so that is all part of the hook up what I need to existing."" [Agent] ""So yeah. Yep Yeah, so that'll be like the technician you let him know because that is part of Verizon, right? that that."" [Customer] ""No, actually right now, no, it is a camera company and they hooked it up to cable vision, but it is to."" [Agent] ""The cam OK"" [Customer] ""That $230 something dollars a month that I do not want to pay anymore, so I will give that bill back to him and he will shut it off or do whatever and I just want to use the cameras so I would probably have to hook the cameras up to my account now, but I do not I have to check with him with that."" [Agent] ""Yeah Yes. Yeah, so then."" [Customer] ""I got to check with the landlord to find out if I can do that."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""Now I am renting here. Do I need permission from a landlord or anything to do any of this, or this is, I mean, it is just running a wire, so."" [Agent] ""No, no, because we have, yeah, we have, believe it or not, we have two accounts here, so yeah, it is just running the wires, so you, we do not need permission for that, and there is other accounts that had our service before you."" [Customer] ""Yeah, it looks like there is, I said at one time there was like X routers up front or or modems or or whatever."" [Agent] ""I see that, yeah."" [Customer] ""There was a lot of stuff up there. And honestly, we do not know what works and what does not work."" [Agent] ""Yeah That is what Stuff, yeah, the technician will take a look and he yeah, he will be, you know, that is when you know when we make an appointment we want you there we well we need you there so that you talk to the technician and tell him, you know what you want and what you do not want he is he will definitely help you out with that."" [Customer] ""So that is why I do not want to use any of that old whatever is there. I want. I think that is what they did. Yeah, so is it the same type of cable like Verizon changed from DSL to fiber optics as you guys still have the same Whatever you are using, it is a cable wire, I guess, or?"" [Agent] ""Yes, definitely."" [Customer] ""Are they changing anything? They are not going to tell me next year that it is not available anymore and we are now XG only or something like that."" [Agent] ""Yeah, well, if they, if, no, I know we do not do that, but if they, if they do, we always keep the accounts you have a choice if we do change it to like, let us say fiber, you know, but we do not tell customers you have to change over to fiber. There is a lot of customers in fiber areas that still have coax cable, so we do not do that, you know. I do not know why Verizon is doing that."" [Customer] ""So we are still in the. We are still in the coax area. We are not switching to you do you have fiber optics or anything or"" [Agent] ""Um, let us take a look in this area. Let me see if it is fiber. Yeah we can do fiber. Let me just see here. If you want we can do fiber."" [Customer] ""Is that more is it better? Is it worth it or?"" [Agent] ""Um,"" [Customer] ""I, I do not really know."" [Agent] ""You are not really doing much upload downloading. I would keep with the coax cable for you. Fibers are really meant for like people like video people that are uploading stuff."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I just"" [Agent] ""But the coax cable, it should, it should be fine because the building, you know, then you are looking at like running like fiber lines. I am not sure if the fiber is closer to it is I would stick with the, I would stick with the coax cable because they are already in there. In the fiber."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I mean, we have had a lot of problems with the cable wires here."" [Agent] ""For now."" [Customer] ""Again, I do not know if it is because of all the splitters and how many freaking things there are, but."" [Agent] ""It is, yeah, we will we are going to clean that up for you. So it is, it is up to you. Do you want to set it up? Do you want, you know do you want to start a process I can not even have a technician come out there."" [Customer] ""Yeah, so this is going to be like one. Yeah, and maybe he come out and tell me what I need to make sure that it is not like, OK, you have to have fiber optics and then it is too expensive for me to switch it or something or?"" [Agent] ""No, fiber is the same price as Coa."" [Customer] ""Oh."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""Because I do have with the cameras and two computers, I mean."" [Agent] ""Yeah, the only thing that fiber that I why I am not recommending is because with the phone there is some features that you are not able to get on fiber."" [Customer] ""I will be still fine."" [Agent] ""Like the call um forwarding I believe you can not do that is why I am saying, you know, especially your phone with your business I want to yeah."" [Customer] ""Oh, yeah, cause I, I do need, I do need."" [Agent] ""That is why I am."" [Customer] ""I need one of the phones. My cell phone is, is forwarded to my cell phone."" [Agent] ""Yeah, so that is why I am saying stick with the coax cable for now."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And then the fiber comes in, then we can, you know, we can switch in."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""I, if I can give you a promotion, I will, you know, so I can do it that way. And if you want to do the mobile too, the only thing that you do have to pay up front for the mobile would be the same activation fee, which is like $20.87."" [Customer] ""So they do not They do not give us a phone for the mobile. It is I have to use a different you just use a normal, just any cell phone or"" [Agent] ""Yeah, what with the phone that you have now."" [Customer] ""I"" [Agent] ""We would use."" [Customer] ""Yeah, the phone I have now has been dropped way too many times in a cracked screen, so."" [Agent] ""Um, you can purchase a phone."" [Customer] ""I do not know if I would use that one I guess I could"" [Agent] ""I would, I, you know, you can, it is easier to use your phone because it is, it is quicker you know then if you purchase a phone you just have to wait for the phone to, you know, get done"" [Customer] ""OK. Yeah, well. I just leave a broken phone and then they do not have to worry about a screen that looks so pretty anyway."" [Agent] ""Yeah So let us take a look here. Let me go into the address. I just want to make sure I have the address right. XXX Route XX, and I have, I guess, Hertz, um, no, Hertz in here, uh, let me see."" [Customer] ""Yeah, Hurts used to be here."" [Agent] ""Oh OK good so then it is the right address, perfect."" [Customer] ""And and Eagle Eagle is do I kind of buy, I am I am paying their bill for the cameras and my computer."" [Agent] ""Yes. Yeah, yeah, let us eliminate that. Let us get you with your own service to save you some money."" [Customer] ""But yeah, cause he, he wants to save his phone number, so that is fine."" [Agent] ""He can, yeah, that is fine, exactly."" [Customer] ""I just want my own."" [Agent] ""Alright, so let us see here, so what is the name of the business going to be?"" [Customer] ""Black Diamond Garage."" [Agent] ""OK Great, and do you have the tax ID number for the business?"" [Customer] ""Yeah. Mhm Uh I usually remember it my mind is totally blank"" [Agent] ""Well yeah you are stressed out. I totally get it."" [Customer] ""I have it, yeah. Well, I spent at least an hour just trying to get onto the phone with a person this morning with Verizon after they gave me the number to call to find out about this thing."" [Agent] ""Oh goodness."" [Customer] ""So I was started out aggravated. You guys were only like X minutes to find a person."" [Agent] ""Remind me. Yeah, and remind me to give you a better telephone number since you have the premium tech support once we are done, OK, because they pick up in less than X rings."" [Customer] ""And it is not an automated system that just keeps going in a loop."" [Agent] ""No. No, no, not at all. I would not do that to you."" [Customer] ""Oh, that is what I had."" [Agent] ""Oh that is crazy."" [Customer] ""OK, I have a number."" [Agent] ""OK, I am ready."" [Customer] ""Yeah. I got XXXXXX-XXX."" [Agent] ""OK, so XXXXXX-XXX."" [Customer] ""Yeah.""

[Agent] ""Yes, so once you are active with the first line, you go through the portal you can switch over the other line So the first line, like I said, it is $45 after X months you get $40 off the business account, so it drops down to $5. Any additional line would be like, um, I believe it is $25 each line. Let me just double check. Let me make sure. Or XX depending on the plan that you get.""

[Agent] ""Yeah, so remember, so like if for the 1st X months it is $45 a cell phone, but after X months you get $40 off the account for this business account, so it drops down to really $5 a month unlimited talking tax."" [Customer] ""Uh, like we do not, we use it to send pictures, that is it. We have to take a picture of a trailer hook up or something, or we can, you know, mobilely check in a truck."" [Agent] ""Yeah Yeah And why pay $40?"" [Customer] ""That is all, that is all it is really used for besides dropping it and using it for."" [Agent] ""Yeah, why pay $40 you know, $40 a month when you can get it for, you know what I mean, that is crazy, $5 yeah."" [Customer] ""X, yeah."" [Agent] ""Let me go see here. And then I will tell you like with taxes, let me take a look here. So And then I, we are going to port this number, so give me one second for that the office number first. So I, so with the with the remember with the email that you are going to get from the company, right, it is probably going to be within like the next like XX minutes please make sure that you fill that out and return it because that is the LOA which is a letter of authorization to say that the number that you gave us is what you want to transfer that XXXXXX number and then the cell phone part of it that takes two days. Because they have to uh send that form out to you but it takes XX hours I think XX hours for them to process it so this one will be like within XX minutes, but the cell phone does take a little longer, right, just to let you know, OK, so let me go into that."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Yeah And make sure you do not call Verizon until you are active so I do not want them to disconnect the phone and then you will be losing your phone. They tend to do that stuff. I do not know why."" [Customer] ""Yeah, just, just to be resentful."" [Agent] ""Yeah. Which is not good, especially for business."" [Customer] ""Yeah, well, that is why I have not done anything, cause I did not really."" [Agent] ""Yeah. Nervous that is why I said when you, yeah.""

[Customer] ""Thank you. You too dear."" [Agent] ""Bye bye bye."" [Customer] ""Alright, bye."" [Agent] ""Alright Gary, so I do have something up here we are going to go over the prices I just needed I just have a couple questions for you just so I do not offer you anything that you do not need, OK?"" [Customer] ""Yeah OK."" [Agent] ""Um, what it, what kind of a business is this and what are we going to be connecting to that Internet?"" [Customer] ""So we were a photography and video production company."" [Agent] ""OK, and do you know more or less?"" [Customer] ""So we will need um wireless one."" [Agent] ""Do you know more or less how many devices you are going to be connecting to that internet one in there or employees you would have?"" [Customer] ""Um. Well, I it is X max X employees."" [Agent] ""OK, oK."" [Customer] ""Yeah."" [Agent] ""All right, any type of cameras that will be going on inside of the business?"" [Customer] ""No, well you offer that service?"" [Agent] ""So what we offer is a static IP service. So when you do have remote cameras cameras, it is the better option to go with it with static IP, um, so that you are not losing your images, um, yeah, that is why we ask that question."" [Customer] ""Uh huh."" [Agent] ""Uh, do you have any customers that will come in and do you want to provide Wi Fi or or um or a Wi Fi for them?"" [Customer] ""OK No."" [Agent] ""No, no Wi Fi, OK."" [Customer] ""No, why is it? What? Tell me why that why is that important?"" [Agent] ""So the pro Wi Fi basically what it does is it it gives them access to your Wi Fi, but you do not want your customers really um using up all of your Wi Fi so what the pro Wi Fi is going to do is it is going to separate your bandwidth."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""You decide how much bandwidth is for the customers and how much bandwidth is for yeah, the business"" [Customer] ""Oh, Yeah, no, no, that is OK."" [Agent] ""OK, and then the other question that I do have for you, do you have any part of a break room or waiting area or anything of that sort?"" [Customer] ""No."" [Agent] ""OK. All right, um, do you, do you need any type of TV inside of the business for cable?"" [Customer] ""No."" [Agent] ""Alright, now our packages usually do come with one phone line for the business."" [Customer] ""No."" [Agent] ""Do you need additional phone lines be it for a fax security or alarm system?"" [Customer] ""Uh huh. Um, when it, when you say come with it, the price I am going to pay will come with a, a landline phone, is that what you are suggesting?"" [Agent] ""Yes, yeah, so it comes with what we do is we bundle so when we bundle we already, you know, we are bundling different things into the price to bring your price down. It is a it is what we call is a buy more save more so the more you get the more you save"" [Customer] ""Uh. Uh And the more I spend."" [Agent] ""Depends because you can end up paying for a gig speed and with the phone line it is not going to it is going to cost you almost exactly the same."" [Customer] ""OK. OK, so tell me, um, OK, so go ahead. I, I do not need a phone."" [Agent] ""OK, alright, so if we go ahead and do it for the gig speed, which is the faster speed, you are looking at a monthly, yes, X gig, so XXXX megabytes per second."" [Customer] ""One gig Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""If if you go with the X gig, you are looking at a monthly rate of XXX. That is going to be for the gig. It is going to already include the phone line and it does include the equipment. You have our XX hour IT support on the account as well for the business, and it would include a connection back up. That connection backup would basically bring you back up in case you lose internet at any point."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh, and what is the, the upload and download speed? Is it XXXX?"" [Agent] ""The down yes, the download speed is XXXX on the gig. The upload speed because it is a coaxial area would be XX."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK, oK."" [Agent] ""So that would be for the gate."" [Customer] ""Um, OK, and it is XXX a month?"" [Agent] ""Mhm that would be XXX monthly."" [Customer] ""There any Are there any specials that are running or any way I can get it cheaper?"" [Agent] ""So No, so there is no contracts."" [Customer] ""is this an do I pay is this an annual contract Or is it month to month no contract, OK."" [Agent] ""It is all month to month and it is a X year price guarantee on the gig, so it, it stays at that rate for X years. We can not change that rate on you for those X years and after the X years, the beauty of it is that you, since you are month to month, you can always speak to our attention team to see what new promotions they have for you for the speed that you, you, you allocate to your business."" [Customer] ""Right, well, the interesting thing is I have Optimum for my home and I attempted to get it cheaper earlier today and there was no way it could be cheaper, so there is no guarantee in X years it can be cheaper, is that correct?"" [Agent] ""Mhm Mhm. And that so they usually with our business accounts they do try to you know get it at least a little bit less than what you are getting at at that when you, you know, when, when it goes up, um."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""And again you do have the option if we do not get you to where you need to be that you can, you know, cancel the account because again we are month to month you are not penalized for canceling"" [Customer] ""Uh-huh, OK. Um, OK, so now, And now that I am having this conversation, if I were to want to think about it and call you or someone else back, do I have to restart the whole process over?"" [Agent] ""So what we can do is if there is something so I can look at are you definitely going towards the gig speed do you want to hear something else with the XXX"" [Customer] ""No, is that is one gig the fastest."" [Agent] ""Yes, one gig is the fastest."" [Customer] ""Yeah, that is what I, that is what I think I need, so."" [Agent] ""OK, so it"" [Customer] ""Yeah, is it, what is, what is the cheaper version of XXX? What is the, what is that cost?"" [Agent] ""So the cheaper, so the $500 the difference between the gig and the XXX is not that much anymore. What they do is it is a $10 difference you are losing half of the speed So it is really not worth going yeah with the $500 when you are going to lose half the speed."" [Customer] ""Uh."" [Agent] ""Let me see what I can do for you with pricing, um, to see if I can get it a little bit lower and this way we can, you know, um, finish this out."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""So just bear with me. I am going to put you on a brief hold, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK Bye bye"" [Agent] ""Thanks. Hold on. OK, so you did mention that you did not need the phone, correct?"" [Customer] ""Correct."" [Agent] ""Alright, so if we take off the phone, it is going to save you $15. Um, the other thing, um, it is still going to give you the gig it is going to save you the $15 and that would bring you down to $140. What I can also do for you, um, I the installation fee on this is, is $100. I can take off the installation for you, um, if you do want to move forward with that, the rate of the $140."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh. OK. Uh, when could it be done?"" [Agent] ""I will tell you now hold on."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""See here. And also just so you know to save a little bit more depending on how the business progresses um. If you were to go with our mobile that is also going to save you another $40 so your price for this would be like $100 and then you would pay for the phone line which is $45 so you really pay like $5 more dollars on this, um, but you will have a mobile, a line."" [Customer] ""So I currently have a mobile phone with Verizon and I was on the phone with one of your colleagues before and we got disconnected somehow they never called me back but um that discussion was had."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""The only problem is is that um I hesitate doing it because I do not know it is quality."" [Agent] ""OK, so we."" [Customer] ""So if I were to, if I were to go, OK."" [Agent] ""So we run off of the T-Mobile towers. So if you know the T-Mobile service, that is really what you would be getting."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I have not heard much good about it."" [Agent] ""Cause that is the kind of service."" [Customer] ""I have only heard yeah, I have only heard good about Verizon That is the issue."" [Agent] ""Uh, OK."" [Customer] ""You can ask around regarding T-Mobile. So, so XXX no set up charge."" [Agent] ""Got you. Correct. And the earliest that I would be able to do this is tomorrow."" [Customer] ""And then Tomorrow, OK. Alright, let me know is there a work number on this if I were to call you back?"" [Agent] ""So here is what I can do for you. What I can do for you, there is no obligation for you to keep it until it actually goes in, and even once it goes in, you have a XX day money back guarantee on it. So what I can do for you to get grab that installation and grab the additional discount. I can go ahead I can schedule you I can send you an email if you decide not to move forward with it, you would just email me back and just let me know, hey, listen, I am not going to move forward with it I have something else, um, and, and no harm done"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""We would go ahead and cancel and that would be it. um, if you do decide to move forward with it, at least you have it in for tomorrow or even Friday I have an availability on Friday."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, I actually can not do it tomorrow, maybe Friday, but, um, I really do not even want to do that at this point."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""Um, is there any way that I will have to redo this whole process again? There is a work order I can call you back in the next X days."" [Agent] ""So there would not be a work order on it, but my question to you is what detains you from closing this now? Is it the price?"" [Customer] ""Because Yeah, you know, it is really a combo of I want to reach out to Verizon to see what they have to offer before I move forward."" [Agent] ""OK, oK, so you can definitely shop around. That is not an issue. Like I said, there is no obligation, but let me see if I can get it down a little bit more, um, since you are mentioning that mhm."" [Customer] ""Because right now, just so you know, right now, um, I am paying in the current office I am then I am paying $99 a month actually maybe it is $109 so if you can come close to that, that'd be wonderful it would be no major issue."" [Agent] ""OK, alright, bear with me, hold on, OK?"" [Customer] ""I do not think."" [Agent] ""Thanks. OK, here is what we can do Gary, so we can give you the gig speed If we do it on an auto pay, it would be $90. If we do it without the auto pay, it would be $95. You know if you are going to go with the autopay or without?"" [Customer] ""I will go with the auto pay on the credit card."" [Agent] ""OK. Yeah, so we will go ahead, we will do it for $90. We can do it with the free installation. It would be the gig speed with um the equipment already included on that one and um we again we can get it done for you on Friday from X to X."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Now will this have a wireless router so I can uh or or I can go hardwire? How does that work?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, so you can hardwire it and it, it is a what we call is a combined modem router, so it is, it is, it is both."" [Customer] ""OK. OK, and when if I have the computers there when your staff is there, uh, they can have everything set up?"" [Agent] ""So yes, so what they would do is they would go ahead, they would install the modem, um, and they would just basically wait until you know everything is up and running and just make sure that everything is working properly and then they would, you know, exit the facility."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh. I see. OK, oK, so let us do it."" [Agent] ""OK, so we will do it um Friday X to X and the best one, OK, OK."" [Customer] ""OK, let me look. Let me look tomorrow I know tomorrow is not good, um, you have a window."" [Agent] ""Wednesday?"" [Customer] ""A window for No, no, a window for Friday, a window of time."" [Agent] ""Oh, So it would be a X to X window that I have."" [Customer] ""X to X, um, that is good actually, uh, you know, I am sorry, not tomorrow but Friday is that is that for Friday."" [Agent] ""Mhm. Friday, yeah, for Friday."" [Customer] ""Friday X to X, yeah, that is fine."" [Agent] ""Alright, so we will go ahead and do it on Friday from X to X. It is $90 again with no installation that is going to be for the gig speed with your equipment included and that'll be installed into XXXX Highway XX, uh, Suite XA in Wall, New Jersey, OK?"" [Customer] ""Correct."" [Agent] ""Alright, so let us go ahead and um the last thing I need to do is just enroll it for the auto pay."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Are you going to do that with a card or a bank account?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, credit card."" [Agent] ""OK, let me go ahead and do that."" [Customer] ""You tell you anyway."" [Agent] ""Sure, is it a Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express?"" [Customer] ""Um, American Express."" [Agent] ""American Express OK, go ahead with the card number."" [Customer] ""XX I am sorry, this that XXXX."" [Agent] ""Mhm. OK."" [Customer] ""XX XXX."" [Agent] ""Uh-huh."" [Customer] ""XXXX"" [Agent] ""Mhm.""

OK, so that has been successfully been successfully set up for the auto pay. Just know that the first month it is going to send you out a bill. Just make sure that you send that specific bill out then the second billing period will come out of the auto pay, OK"" [Customer] ""So I am going to pay the first bill it is not going to be charged to my account, is that what you are saying?"" [Agent] ""Correct, correct, they you would, you would send it out you can give us a call or you can do it online and I am also going to give you the account number for this as well.""

[Agent] ""Correct, yes."" [Customer] ""OK, OK, great. What do I need to do next?"" [Agent] ""So that would be it.

When the tech comes out they are going to set you up with everything in full with the equipment. Now you guys are never in a contract, as you know you can always upgrade, downgrade any time"" [Customer] ""Mhm. Mhm."" [Agent] ""We will come out and supply you with that Internet modem if you need, I can ship you a physical phone with the um with like a wireless handset if you have your own physical phone you can use it with the equipment."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Yeah we have um."" [Agent] ""And then even with the service you will just connect them into that phone modem and they can even supply you guys with the connection failover device."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So if anybody hits a nearby pole, say the Internet comes down with the weathering, anything of in like an internet outage for you guys, it will automatically kick back up for you."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Mhm."" [Agent] ""So if you have like your POS, anything that is critical for your business here."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""And then even with that we do also give you guys premier tech services just in case if anything happens on site you get a direct number they can even remote access your equipment, any type of outage you guys are having.""

We will definitely upgrade you guys into a faster speed."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""That is going to be your high speed of XGB so you will get XXXX over XX megabytes per second"" [Customer] ""OK, I think, I think that is probably what our issue was. I just did not know what our internet capacity was because our internet was really bad. It was like a really, really bad slow service."" [Agent] ""It was just the speed that was giving you an issue."" [Customer] ""Yeah, it was a it was a, it caused a lot of interruptions with credit card transactions, you know, and we are becoming very frustrated, but I do not know about this, so I did not know what our speed was or anything, and then it is like it is such a fast paced environment for them to have to get on a phone and call the company and go through all the steps. It is it is very hectic."" [Agent] ""And especially when a card machine, you do not want somebody to stand there to wait to have to."" [Customer] ""So it sounds. Exactly, yeah."" [Agent] ""Mhm"" [Customer] ""OK, so"" [Agent] ""Now even with the service, do you guys have like a um like a so when the customers call and do you have a roll over line or it is just that main number they call?"" [Customer] ""Mhm. No, it is just a main number."" [Agent] ""And then nothing set up for like emergency purposes it is just that one line."" [Customer] ""No, it is just that one line. It is work, it is been working for years that way, so I do not think we would want to change that. We just want to make sure that we get the right internet speed and that there is no interruptions with the actual, you see, the thing I, which I did not realize with Verizon was that the phone lines do not work like they work with the internet, that that is horrible for us because if something goes wrong with the internet, then we do not have um phone."" [Agent] ""I see and did they give you that like um I forget what it is called but it is like a physical phone with them where it wants to have voice over ID yeah."" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, it, it, that, that was horrible. Like if we would have, we have it we have service right now, we have that service, but what happens is if there is any interruption with the internet, that what we provided was a secondary phone, and that was my son's cell phone. So every time that we have a problem with the internet, all the calls roll over to his phone to make the credit card transactions we have to use his phone and it was a disaster. Like that that that can not be like we need a landline to work as a landline you know, not"" [Agent] ""Oh yeah, definitely not. Yeah, not a you do not want to go to a cell."" [Customer] ""To work Yeah, exactly."" [Agent] ""Now it is even good with this when I give you that connection failover because that business phone is critical for you guys with that failover you can put in up to X devices that are critical, so I would recommend definitely putting that POS and that phone."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Mhm. Mhm."" [Agent] ""Therefore, anything happens then an outage pole goes down, you guys are still up and running"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""It does not have to go to your cell phone."" [Customer] ""Can I, can I put you on hold for one second, please?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, take your time no rush."" [Customer] ""Thank you. Hello?"" [Agent] ""Yep, I am still here can you hear me?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, I was trying to get another call but it did not go through so I am, I am here."" [Agent] ""Now with everything here because I know before it looks like you guys were in a standard when you open back up I can give you guys new customer promotions and even extend that period so within the pricing here for you guys I am not too sure what the equipment that you have with files, but if you are in a contract with them, I could send you over a document anything that is like an early termination we can help you guys out with that here."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Mhm. OK, I do not even know what they are, what it is if we are in the contract not we just do not want that service anymore, so"" [Agent] ""And even with you guys you should be in like a probationary period so you might just be able to return everything with the equipment."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK, well, once I have them set up with with you guys then I am going to proceed with you know, terminating the account all that because you can not be left without any service"" [Agent] ""And then And we will make sure we will handle all of the phone stuff for you guys so when we come out we will make sure that same number is up and running."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK, so there will not be any interruption with the phone line uh switching from one company to the other, right?"" [Agent] ""Correct, yeah, it is seamless so as soon as we come out, put in that equipment, it just comes right over from the other company."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK."" [Agent] ""And then in that price promo I can price lock you for XX months, X years, never a contractor just price guaranteeing and with that X gig all of your equipment, even with that telephone line I could price lock you at XXX with the auto pay."" [Customer] ""Mhm. Mhm."" [Agent] ""If you guys do not do the auto pay, it comes out XXX, but if you do, it comes out XXX."" [Customer] ""Mhm. OK, um, OK, that is, that is what it is, it is fine."" [Agent] ""And then typically I get you guys back up and running there is a $100 fee, but I can go ahead and waive that for you guys here since you are going to be coming back over from the other company here."" [Customer] ""OK. I appreciate that."" [Agent] ""And the only thing I need from you, what is a good email address I could send some paperwork to?"" [Customer] ""Mhm.

So if you have anything there then that would be on that account this would be on this account It depends, you know, we, we connect boxes to each of the TVs, so whatever the business TVs are going to be, that is where we would connect this one."" [Customer] ""OK, um. The TV is, does it include like all the regular channels or?""

You do not have to use it. It is up to you, but it is there and it is what gives you more savings in the bundle. Um, if we go with this one, you are looking at a monthly rate of XXX that is going to include your equipment, the phone line, it does include the XX hour IT support on the account and it does include our backup. So if the internet was to go down the backup would basically pick you back up so you are not left with nothing"" [Customer] ""Online for the XXX and for the X gigabyte, it was not coming to XXX, it was like only like XXX.""

So was that not included in this or is that was that a whole separate thing that they just signed me up for?"" [Agent] ""So that is a mobile. If it is a business mobile, it it it is going to work to your benefit. So let us say if it is a business mobile, it would count for your $40 discount on your business account. So right now, let us say you did take the $175 plan, it is going to give, it is going to bring you, it is going to give you a $40 discount, it is going to bring you to $135 when it is with a gig."" [Customer] ""OK, so like what I just had the phone I just signed up for, is that not going to be included with like, well that is all included in this package?"" [Agent] ""That will be, that will be separate because if you signed up separately with it, that will be separate, um, but again it is going to benefit you because if you put it under this business name it is going to give you a $40 discount on this so in part it is going to have to do with this because it is going to give you that discount but it is its own, it would be its own separate bill."" [Customer] ""Oh, so you are saying it is better to keep it like that than to just do it under."" [Agent] ""What do you mean?"" [Customer] ""Cause you said with the Wi Fi, it already includes a mobile phone, right?"" [Agent] ""It does not, so it does not already include a mobile phone, no, no, no, it does not."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK, OK."" [Agent] ""It includes a phone line which is um the landline so that you can use for either a phone, a fax, or security alarm, whatever the case is, it is just what it gives you more savings, um, but going back to the offer that you did see online, let me just take one more look and see what I can do for you here so that we can try to match to what you saw online, OK?"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Hold on. OK, so what we can do, we can do it with the gig speed. You can still maintain with the phone line if we do that one and you do it with the auto pay, it would be 1:15."" [Customer] ""OK, wait, you just said phone line, but I thought you said it is not the full month. Oh, you were saying that the phone line.""

About $75 once they apply that credit for the mobile."" [Customer] ""Oh, OK, OK. Great, great, great. OK."" [Agent] ""You want to go with this one?"" [Customer] ""So, um, Yeah, how long will it take to set up cause I only have about XX minutes before I have to go to work right now, um.""

That is what you will be paying total, um, together the $155 and the $90"" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So it comes out to be 2:45.

Uh, the technician, uh, was able to trace that back to that access point, um, uh, which he said was a Cisco, uh. Uh Wi Fi access point, uh, and he said that like they do not even make them anymore uh and that it should be replaced with the ruckus, um, I do not know if that is a brand name or a or a type of equipment, um, and that was being fed by.""

[Customer] ""Um, no, I would say it is about, uh. Maybe XX ft, uh, I mean, we will say XXX ft by XX ft, so, uh. I guess it is like XXXX square feet, right?"" [Agent] ""OK. And then in that area you just have like a guest public Wi Fi set up."" [Customer] ""Correct. Yup. Um And we noticed, I think uh like our our uh ring doorbell was attached to that also and that stopped working. I think that is what triggered um. You know that that it was not working, uh, and he had said that you know that, uh, you know, not to connect the ring to that because it is, you know, uh, a very slow system it it would need more I guess, uh."" [Agent] ""Yeah and you guys were alerted."" [Customer] ""Capacity for lack of a better term."" [Agent] ""And And at the moment you guys definitely do have a good internet speed.

[Agent] ""I am not sure if you guys had anything set up through it. I can not see on my side. But with the new equipment they will bring you, you can either set up an access point with a splash page. You can set it up however you like to customize it, even if you wanted to throttle the Internet that is used on that access point."" [Customer] ""OK.""

[Agent] ""That said, yeah, I can get you down if we do XXX if we just get the lower on the product protection."" [Customer] ""For the protection, uh, what is that protecting?"" [Agent] ""Like that.

[Customer] ""Yeah, yeah, I, I would say the sooner the better, yeah, because, because we do want to start where she is crashing now and she wants to, she wants to do the secure network and if we wait too long, then it is like, OK, we are getting these people in, we are using the old stuff, yeah, yeah, we want to do it as soon as possible."" [Agent] ""Yeah, I am I am going to see Oh, that is right. I am good thank you, thank you for mentioning that. I do have if I have to, you want to add the static IP for the cameras, that is the point. I got to add that back in. Thank you for mentioning I was, I was just, I was going over my notes I just noticed that we, we missed the static IP That is what you need to"" [Customer] ""The static IP will give up the a secure network, right?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, yeah, the static IP is what gives you the secure and that one's XX bucks."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Yeah, but I, I, I."" [Customer] ""So what we are back at XXX now?"" [Agent] ""Now we are at XXX. Yes, it goes down another $5 once you do auto pay."" [Customer] ""Oh Um, Who may have the laptop that she wants to, she wants to purchase a laptop so just in case she can not come into the office she can do designs in the house"" [Agent] ""Now my other question is you have T-Mobile Do you have any other business, business mobile or tablets? Well, I could tell you if."" [Customer] ""So we may need that."" [Agent] ""Add a tablet line if you add a tablet line or another mobile line, I can give you a $40 discount on the Internet price. Because you have to get"" [Customer] ""Yeah"" [Agent] ""So that would bring you down XX bucks, right?"" [Customer] ""Uh, Yeah, I do not know because I, I know I got to get her phone. I got to get her phone either attached to my T-Mobile business account I may have to open her own account with the existing number she has"" [Agent] ""Yeah. Well Well, that, that if you could do if you could bring your device, you do not have to get a new phone, but if you put it this way, you add the line, you get the $40 discount."" [Customer] ""Yeah, and then how much would the line be a month?"" [Agent] ""Well, it depends. The most popular plan is the $45.01 because it is unlimited and it comes with XXGB of premium data. But if this phone's always going to be at Wi Fi, they have plans as low as $15 a month. So it really depends on how you are using the phone."" [Customer] ""Well this this is going to be her phone. She is going to be walking around with it everywhere she goes, uh, because a lot of, a lot of clients call her she, she does a lot of measurements out in the field, so"" [Agent] ""OK, so then, OK, so if you are looking at rolling. Yeah OK, yeah, then, then the $45 unlimited plan is, is the most popular and, and that is the other thing we work off the T-Mobile networks now as well, so you are already getting the same er along with the optimum hotspots so you get the hotspots plus the T-Mobile network."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So especially in a tri-state area where."" [Customer] ""OK.""

And right now I am trying to get the tech to come tomorrow between XX to X, uh, and about a half an hour before they would call XXX-XXX-XXXX."" [Customer] ""Sounds good. XX to X, that is perfect.""

[Customer] ""Well, we have really high speed internet actually I want to get the uh the sort of, I forget, I was looking at your website, so you have got like X different tiers, right Um. So I would like to get the lowest tier just start with that and see how that works for us. Um, we were back in XXXX, XXXX we are doing a lot of video streaming and stuff and so we had a higher speed, but we are not really doing that anymore so we can go with a lower speed."" [Agent] ""OK, yeah, so the lowest option I am sure if you are looking at it online it is in this area I believe it is the XXX speed, right?"" [Customer] ""Yeah, I think that is what it was. Sounds right, XXX. I think it was like XXX, XXX and X GB or something, right?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, one gig is, again, I, I am not sure what you are using it for, um, how many computers or laptops, what are, what are we using it for?"" [Customer] ""Well right now we have only got like one person working in the office with a laptop so it is mostly just used for, you know, backing up uh to the cloud so we do not we do not need super high speed we do not have anything streaming or anything"" [Agent] ""OK, OK, so if it is one. OK, so if we do the, the lowest tier or the. XXX speed. With one number. We would be looking at about. XXX. That is if you do auto pay."" [Customer] ""XXX."" [Agent] ""Yeah, that is with auto pay."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""If you do not wish to do auto pay, it is about XXX."" [Customer] ""OK. No, I want to do auto pay. It is just easier for me. You do not have to remember it every month."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""Um, yeah, that sounds, that sounds good."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""I think we are probably paying around XXX right now for the higher speed internet and we just, we are not doing enough to support that. So I think, uh, I think that XXX with uh one phone line transporting the number over is probably going to be good. Um, we also have uh a mobile phone that um can I, can I add that to the account?"" [Agent] ""100%. If you add an unlimited plan to that account. So let us say you are on auto pay with the XXX speed. And one landline, your bill is XXX with auto pay, right?"" [Customer] ""Mhm. Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""If you add a Unlimited mobile plan, you automatically save $15 off of your internet bill, which comes down to $90. Plus your mobile bill."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Your mobile bill is about $45. That is unlimited talk, unlimited text, unlimited data you have about X gigabytes of mobile hotspot"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""So XX for your mobile, XX for your internet and landline."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Um, that is a great way to save some money."" [Customer] ""Mm. Yeah, so is that kind of typical or is that like a special offer that is limited time or what is that for the cell phone?"" [Agent] ""Um, I would not say it is limited time because that is just what the offers are when a customer, an optimum internet customer brings in a line, a mobile line, you get savings, OK?"" [Customer] ""Mhm OK."" [Agent] ""You get the most savings with the gig. I just want to give you an idea of what it would be with the gig, just so you have an idea."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Um."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""X gig with one landline comes out to XXX. You save $40 by being a mobile customer."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""So that bill comes down to XXX."" [Customer] ""Oh."" [Agent] ""So you have X gigabyte and X landline for XXX. Plus XX for the unlimited plan, so all in you are at XXX plus tax, right?"" [Customer] ""That is at XXXX for the whole, the whole thing."" [Agent] ""Yes, just keep in mind, Cynthia."" [Customer] ""Yeah, so it is really not that."" [Agent] ""Yeah, it, it, it is, uh, keep in mind when you do mobile."" [Customer] ""OK"" [Agent] ""Um, it is a separate account and it has to be on autopay, but it is, you know, under the same umbrella because I link the two accounts together for your internet account to get the savings. So yeah, when you really come down to look at the numbers, right?"" [Customer] ""Oh, I see."" [Agent] ""X gig with uh the landline. And the mobile XXX, the XXX speed is what, XX XX, XXX, the price difference is $15. Just the thought, right? You save more with the gig when you do the mobile.""

We did not even do that one that is the middle tier."" [Customer] ""Mhm"" [Agent] ""Alright, so XXX plus. XXX plus the number. One sec. That is 1:15, XXX minus XX for being a mobile customer XX. you know, for $5 more you are getting the XXX speed. So yeah, let us."" [Customer] ""Yeah, well."" [Agent] ""The XXX speed you are at XX, the XXX speed XX, the gig XXX, and your mobile is always going to be XX."" [Customer] ""Right, right, right, right, OK."" [Agent] ""So"" [Customer] ""Um, I actually kinda want to think about adding the mobile, uh, give it a little bit of time."" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""Um, can we just go ahead and arrange to do the XXX tier plus the phone line today?"" [Agent] ""Yeah."" [Customer] ""And um the thing is I am using my personal phone for the uh company phone at the moment and so um I am OK with doing that sort of for a while but not too much longer um I just I just need to get everything kind of moved and see how we are doing then I can make some upgrades Does that sound OK to you?""

[Customer] ""Well, I guess I just need general um maybe local channels for the clients when they sit in, you know, to watch some TV like that."" [Agent] ""OK. Got you. Yeah, of course, but, and nothing crazy, right? You just want to be able to have a good balance of like some local news channels, maybe a TV show or something to keep them occupied while they are waiting."" [Customer] ""Right."" [Agent] ""OK perfect. All right. So I am looking at the market that you are in Theodora, and what that means is. Certain markets will get certain speeds. You happen to be in our one gig market which means that uh let us see according to the map that I am looking at right now about."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, about 80% of the businesses in your area are using our X gig speeds so you will, you will be able to very quickly get service, uh, with that speed and, um Based on what you told me about the channels that you are going to look for, uh, you are going to need the choice package, right? The choice package is, uh, a healthy blend of your local news, a couple of like international news like uh Fox or CNN, MSNBC, um, and then, you know, get a couple of shows too, nothing, nothing too crazy, um, but like your local shows, right? It is a very basic package, um. You will have one box unless you needed more than one box, Theodore."" [Customer] ""Mm. And when you mean one box like for your TV box?"" [Agent] ""Yeah yeah like if you have more than one television I will be happy to provide you with a box for each television because sometimes our businesses they do not want the same thing on every television they may want to have news in one area and maybe something for the.""

Let us see here, um, OK, sure, sure, yeah."" [Customer] ""Question Is this something that I should set up or leave that to my IT team so they could determine how much um services do I need."" [Agent] ""Well this is something you can easily set up um I could ask you just a couple of questions to make sure that you are getting the appropriate speed uh so that way we are not giving you too much we are also not giving you too little um so for example, Theodora Off the top of your head, it does not have to be an exact number how many computers do you think are going to be used during um your most busiest time"" [Customer] ""Mm."" [Agent] ""How many do you think?"" [Customer] ""No X."" [Agent] ""OK, now these computers, do you know if um they include laptops or tablets or are they just regular like desk computers?"" [Customer] ""Desk and lap."" [Agent] ""OK, so, so it is a mix, uh, X total devices, some of them laptops, some of them desktops OK, OK, now, um, how about like your cell phone, for example, right"" [Customer] ""Yes. Mm Mhm."" [Agent] ""Are you going to connect to the Wi Fi on your cell phone?"" [Customer] ""Oh yeah, for sure."" [Agent] ""OK, so that is going to be X devices. Um, if there is anyone else that will be doing that same thing, I know not all of the employees will be allowed to connect to the business Wi Fi, but maybe management or something like that tend to have that access so we have X devices right now um, given that this is an accounting business, uh, I am going to assume Theodora that you do have like a wireless printer of some sort over there"" [Customer] ""Mm. Yeah, I will need um wireless printer and it will not be only my cell phone to be connected."" [Agent] ""Yeah. Mhm."" [Customer] ""But um also be available to the other employees if needed."" [Agent] ""That is really nice of you. Um, you know, I have had previous employers that were very, very strict and said, no, you can not use our internet. I do not care what the situation is, uh, so I think it is lovely that you provide that ability for your employees. Um, so now, so now we are looking at potentially XX or more devices that are connected to the Internet, so I am definitely going to suggest that you take advantage um of the X gigabyte speed just like the other businesses in your area are doing, um, this will allow for your business to function very smoothly, um, and do you have a credit card machine there?"" [Customer] ""Mhm. Right."" [Agent] ""Like for like a point of sale system for for your customers?"" [Customer] ""Um, Yeah, we will have one as well."" [Agent] ""Oh yeah, yeah, you are, you are definitely going to need the X gigabyte speed and I know for a fact your IT team will agree with that, um."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""And I am assuming that in the building or maybe on the outside of the building there is security cameras too."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""OK, alright, so yeah, you, you, you will need the X gigabyte speed in order for your business to function and the cameras to like really do their job. Um,"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""OK, let me see here. So there, there are no contracts here, Theodora. You do not have to worry about getting locked into something."" [Customer] ""Mm Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, there are no cancellation fees. There is no early cancellation fee either. So let us say you have our services for X or X months and then you cancel them, there is no penalty for that, um. What we will do is we will give you a promotional price. It will be a X year promotion that'll be $229 a month that is going to include your internet, your TV, your phone line the box, all the hardware, everything is included There is no like hidden fees or anything like that, um, and let us see if there is anything else that I am missing here that I could provide for you, but it seems like. You are getting the best deal that we could offer, so give me one more moment, Theodore. Did you have, um, uh, uh, a time frame that you were looking to get this installed by? Like was there a date that you were moving into this location are you already there"" [Customer] ""Um, I have um some individuals doing some work. Like, um, doing the floors, painting."" [Agent] ""Mhm. OK, OK."" [Customer] ""Um You know, start doing some upgrades in there um to the facility at the office and then."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""So basically, If should be done within this week. I, I am, I am told."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""So I do not know if"" [Agent] ""Well"" [Customer] ""It has to be the work done before going in or it could be during, during the time."" [Agent] ""Just Mm. Well that is a great question I will tell you what the best part about optimum technicians doing the installation is that we do not need the business to be completely finished and renovated before we can install your services It is actually kind of better for you to install the services while this work is getting done because um let us say that. There is a specific area that you want to have the, the cable boxes or the modem, right? for your internet, you can then tell the technician where to put it and then have your, your, your uh construction crew, right?"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""The people that are doing your painting and whatnot, they can work around that to make it look like, like almost it belonged there, you know, like, like it is not obvious that somebody came in after like it looks like it was put together."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""I, I guess in a way that that makes it look like it was supposed to be there, you, you know what I mean? So, um, this is actually a good time to get it installed while that work is getting done. um, now technically speaking, Theodora, we can be there as soon as tomorrow um we do have availability, uh I do not want to paint you into a corner, um, you know, if there is any other day, uh, please let me know and I am, I am happy to let to to work with you"" [Customer] ""OK. I think Friday would be best."" [Agent] ""OK, so Friday is going to be the 16th. Now we do have X to XX we have X to X p.m., so we have X to XX in the morning and X to X in the afternoon Theodora, which works best for you?"" [Customer] ""X to X."" [Agent] ""Excellent. OK, and what I am going to do, Theodore is I am going to leave you as the point of contact for our technician when they are on their way, uh, if that is OK with you."" [Customer] ""Absolutely."" [Agent] ""Perfect. OK, and just to confirm, the best number they could reach you is area code XXX-XXX-XXXX, correct?"" [Customer] ""XX, yes."" [Agent] ""Yes, perfect. OK, so I have you all set up for uh this installation, but. Because this message is flashing on my screen to inform you if I do not tell you this Theodore, I, I will get in a little bit of trouble. So, um, this particular zip code XXXXX is eligible for additional discounts if the business owner."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""Um, like, like your cell phone that we are talking on right now, if you bring your cell phone over to Optimum Mobile, what happens is you get discounts on your, your, your bill here, right? So you know it is uh $229 right now you can get up to $40 off just by bringing two phone numbers over. So that'll be $229 minus $40 so your bill will be $189. You can keep your phone. You can keep your phone number, and the best part is those lines will be just $25 a month. Normally those phone lines are $45 a month, but the promotion in your zip code, Theodora, means that. Of that $45 you get a $20 discount on that so that makes the phone line just $25 a month and that that discount gets applied as a credit on your bill and if you have two phone lines, it could be $40 discounts and you can have two phone lines that are just $25 a piece. Just putting that out there so you know um if you have anyone in the business or even yourself right that that you wanted to take advantage of this offer, you are more than welcome to"" [Customer] ""But do not I get a, a line, a phone line for the business?"" [Agent] ""Oh no you do yes you do for the business you do yes that that is going to be a traditional phone line but let us say um yourself if you have if you are married or if you have any children and you have a family plan and you decided, uh, you know, I want to save some money well we can bring your lines over we are powered by the T-Mobile network and Optimum hotspots so you are covered like twice, um, and if you do that."" [Customer] ""I am with T-Mobile already."" [Agent] ""Oh well look at that so you are going to use the same network you are going to pay like more than half the price I am not sure what you are paying per month per line, but I am pretty sure it is not, you know, $25 for like yourself and someone else."" [Customer] ""Mm, it is a lot more."" [Agent] ""Mm I know I am unfortunately a Verizon customer. Uh, I do not want to say unfortunately because I, I do not want to speak bad about our competitors, but, but I am paying significantly more and when my contract is up, I have every intention of switching over to Optimum Mobile, um, it, it is just, it is a no brainer really, um, and that is something I could take care of for you really quickly, but I do not want to pressure you. it is just something that, uh, that I needed to tell you because you are eligible for that discount."" [Customer] ""Yeah, um, This is another, I use this number for another business, so I can not bring this over to this one."" [Agent] ""OK. No problem."" [Customer] ""So. I need to have um, I do need to have another in um like mobile device for the this company for and the accounting"" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""So if I could get that, that would be helpful as well."" [Agent] ""Yeah, absolutely, um, so let me ask you if if you have, uh, let us see here, the phone that you have currently right? the one that. Well, actually let me see here so you are there is no other phone that you can use to just bring over. I, I just want to save you some money and have you avoid you know, having to buy another phone Um, we do have an Optimum business mobile device. It is by Motorola. It is Android and it is only $129. So that is, uh, uh, you know, if you, if you want to purchase that phone, great, um, if you wanted to see about another phone, I can help you out with that. And if there was a device you already had, I can certainly get that one hooked up that is actually the the the cheapest way to go."" [Customer] ""I do have another device that I could use."" [Agent] ""Do you have it with you now? Because I am happy to check if uh if it is compatible with the network and if it is I think all it is going to cost is like $20 and some change to to get it activated like the activation fee."" [Customer] ""OK, hold on, let me, let me see if I can get a handle that."" [Agent] ""Yeah, sure, no problem, take your time, of course."" [Customer] ""Can you hold? OK. OK, hello?"" [Agent] ""Yes, I am here."" [Customer] ""OK. Um. So what kind of information would you need? That to give you."" [Agent] ""Uh, well, all I would need is the IMEI number. Is that an iPhone you have or is that a different device?"" [Customer] ""That is the Moto G. XXXX."" [Agent] ""Oh OK excellent."" [Customer] ""Some on the home."" [Agent] ""You know what is funny is that that is the same device except we have the XXXX version that is the same device I was going to suggest to you that was the $129.01. How funny is that? So you basically have the same phone for free."" [Customer] ""Um,"" [Agent] ""That that is wonderful. Alright, so yes, all I would need is the IMEI number, and I am happy to assist you with that if you needed some help finding that."" [Customer] ""Um, Oh God, I could barely see."" [Agent] ""It is OK."" [Customer] ""It is just crazy. Uh, I am blind. Just getting old is not easy."" [Agent] ""Mm. No problem. Let me pull this up for you really quick hold on."" [Customer] ""Yeah. So you want IME, you said?"" [Agent] ""Yeah, the IMEI number."" [Customer] ""Uh-huh."" [Agent] ""So if you let me see here um."" [Customer] ""It is XXX."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""I XXX. Mhm XXX-XXX-XXXXXX."" [Agent] ""Take your time. Mhm. OK, X alright. And uh was there a phone number that you wanted to put on that device or? Um, Was there something else? Like, would you want a new number on that on that phone a new phone number"" [Customer] ""Uh, no. Uh, it, I will need a new phone number because I do not have a number to it. I have not even used it. I just have it."" [Agent] ""That is wonderful. So it is, it is literally like a brand new phone that uh you, you, you, this is probably the best situation for you a brand new phone that you that you do not have to pay twice for, um, you get it on the T-Mobile network for more than half the price this is incredible XXX-XXX OK, so right now I am just going to put this together for you. So you could take advantage of the savings, bear with me one moment. Um, Theodora, I will need that tax ID number one more time if you do not mind."" [Customer] ""OK, it is XXX-XXXXXX."" [Agent] ""OK. Mhm. Perfect XX-XXXXXXX."" [Customer] ""Yes."" [Agent] ""Perfect. OK. Yeah, it is compatible with our network we are going to get you a new phone number."" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""OK, would you like to have insurance on the phone? It is only $7 a month. It covers cracked screens. You get next day replacements, tech support, you know, the, the whole thing that you would normally get with T-Mobile but for less money, $7 a month."" [Customer] ""Yeah, I know."" [Agent] ""OK, no problem. I, I will opt out of that for you right now. You do have XX days to change your mind, so that is, that is not an issue."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""OK, so Let us see here, there, there really was not any other phone number that we could put on here for you because if you wanted a new phone number we would just have to have you pay the first month up front. So all that would be due today I think would be uh. Let me see here. Including the activation fee and the taxes, yeah, all that would be due is just the XXXX and and then that would be it."" [Customer] ""OK, XX."" [Agent] ""XX, yep."" [Customer] ""XX."" [Agent] ""Alright. So give me one moment."" [Customer] ""And I get a new number?"" [Agent] ""Oh yes you do. And, and you know what? I will be able to give you that phone number while we are on the line right now if you just give me a few moments, I will be able to confirm that for you."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""Give me one moment."" [Customer] ""Do I need a SIM card for the, the number to be uh in this phone?"" [Agent] ""Uh, no, actually, the beautiful part, and that is a great question. The beautiful part is that um the regular physical SIM card is being phased out. Everything is now digital, electronic. So the SIM card you have in that phone is an electronic one that will update like over the airwaves, right?"" [Customer] ""Mhm."" [Agent] ""You do not have to do anything."" [Customer] ""Oh."" [Agent] ""Yeah. It is a brave new world we are living in."" [Customer] ""OK."" [Agent] ""All right, so now I am going to make sure that we are linking.

[Agent] ""OK, and guess what? Because the verification came back successful, you no longer have to pay the $65. You are just going to have to pay the $20.38 for the activation fee. So congratulations on that, Theodora. And in a moment we are going to, yeah, in a moment we are going to go ahead and get the payment information so um which card will you be using?""

[Agent] ""OK, and I am going to ask you a few questions for the Internet service. how many devices will be running off the Internet?"" [Customer] ""Um XX maybe."" [Agent] ""OK, so you are going to need the high speed internet."" [Customer] ""Maybe. Credit card transaction processing does not use a lot of bandwidth. It is all text."" [Agent] ""OK, but total devices that will be connected will be around XX because you share the speed with every device that connects to the Wi Fi."" [Customer] ""Right. Right, but if the device is a credit card reader, it is only used you know, to transmit, you know, XX digits plus zip code and X digit code expiration code It is not like they are watching YouTube all day."" [Agent] ""Mhm."" [Customer] ""So I would not just jump to high speed."" [Agent] ""What about security cameras?"" [Customer] ""Those right locally."" [Agent] ""OK."" [Customer] ""To an NVR, so let us, let us just look at the options, you know, we definitely do not want to be spending $300 a month here. We are aiming at, you know, a third of that. We have other locations."" [Agent] ""No, we are We are definitely um not that expensive, sir. So the one big promotion that we offer to our clients now is good for XX months no contracts just mean the price is locked in for XX months Uh, X gig internet with one phone line, motor motor combo included. We do not charge anything for the equipment, strictly just for the service at XXX with auto pay or XXX without the auto pay."" [Customer] ""And what does that jump to after X years because we certainly do not need a gig no matter what."" [Agent] ""Um, I would not know. It depends on so we can only lock in your price for a certain time Um, it depends how expensive flights will get."" [Customer] ""OK. Uh, what, what else do we have like for XXX meg?"" [Agent] ""Uh, we do not have XXX meg. Um, the next tier down it is going to be XXX."" [Customer] ""Really?"" [Agent] ""And let me get that quote for you.""

[Agent] ""Yes, but that account, uh, that that is associated to a different tax ID and a different business name."" [Customer] ""True. OK."" [Agent] ""Because, because you do not pay a rental for the equipment like for using our equipment, however, we do put all of that information and it is locked in in your profile so whenever you do disconnect your service you have to return the equipment and if not you will get charged for that and that is why it is associated every you know every account it has their own um information linked to the equipment.""
